<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Leon, Texas</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For generations, my family has owned property here on Galveston Bay. So it was personal for me when Hurricane Ike took dead aim at this peninsula last month and hammered it to a pulp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The storm destroyed our family pier and some of my relatives' summer homes, causing many thousands of dollars of insured and uninsured losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet three weeks later, surrounded by piles of debris, my husband and I met with a builder to talk about starting construction on our new bay house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly every storm that hits the Gulf Coast brings grim images of ruin and estimates of billions in dollars of damage. Incredulous people, snug in their homes far inland, ask the predictable question: What kind of idiot would build a home in such a vulnerable place?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I can tell you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My family history runs deep in San Leon, a place we've always simply called "the Bay." Around the bend from the pounding surf and sandy beaches of Galveston Island, San Leon is a quieter, more secluded retreat where coastal homes have private piers for fishing and calmer waters that are better-suited to skiing and tubing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 1920s, my great-grandfather and grandfather bought several acres of waterfront land here and built neighboring summer houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My mom spent much of her childhood down at the Bay, getting up before dawn to go fishing with my grandfather and holding summer picnics at the end of the pier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mom and Dad lived at the Bay after they were married. Though they eventually moved back to Houston to raise their eight children, each summer we packed up and went to San Leon, trading our little home in the suburbs for the freedom of life on the water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those were my summers. I took off my shoes and put on a bathing suit on the last day of school, and our weeks were filled with fishing and swimming and water-skiing. We didn't use air conditioning -- just a fan blowing over our cots on the screen porch. We didn't watch television. We made rafts out of driftwood and poled our way down the coastline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The screen door of that old bay house banged constantly with children running in and out, hauling fishing gear or begging for permission to go swimming just one more time. We tolerated sunburns and scoffed at visitors who wore shoes when they swam because they didn't like the squishy bay mud.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Storms were part of life. The Gulf's warm waters are the perfect breeding ground for tropical storms, which occasionally make their way to our part of the coast. Galveston is famous for the horrific 1900 storm, still known as the deadliest hurricane in U.S. history. In 1961, my father shoveled four feet of mud out of the bay house after Hurricane Carla. Many a pier was washed away and rebuilt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through the years, the San Leon property was subdivided among different branches of the family and pieces were sold. But the Bay remained the family gathering place, where all had a sense of belonging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My parents inherited my grandfather's bay house. An aunt built a vacation home next door, and one of my brothers bought my great-grandfather's house. Down the street lived second cousins, third cousins, cousins I didn't even know.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now every summer I take my own two young children to join my big family in San Leon. My daughters go barefoot, leap off the top of the pier, spend hours fishing and swimming with their cousins and scoff at tenderfoot visitors who won't take off their shoes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last winter, my mom had to have the weather-worn old bay house torn down. That was a painful day for my family. We all felt the passing of an era and worried it would never be the same.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But new bay houses will replace it. My mom gave that lot to one of my brothers to build on. And she's given another waterfront lot to me so that I can build, too. I think of a home here as my legacy to my children; a family center of gravity where everyone will be drawn each summer to be together, long after I'm gone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My husband, Tony, an architect, designed us a little home on stilts, and we were getting ready to build when Hurricanes Katrina and Rita hit in 2005. Nearby Galveston was relatively unscathed, but the damage to other parts of the coast unnerved us, and we postponed our plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We had just decided to try again when Hurricane Ike struck Sept. 13.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Ike came ashore, I was focused on my editing job here at the Journal, dispatching reporters and directing our coverage of the storm. San Leon was one of the hardest-hit communities, but I wasn't able to break away from Dallas to go there until Oct. 4.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pictures I had seen didn't carry the sucker punch of actually being there. The house built by my great-grandfather had been swept off its foundation and bashed into a heap of rubble; my aunt's house was destroyed. There was nothing left -- not even a pile of boards -- of another cousin's home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I felt a little queasy as I recognized some of the items wedged in the storm debris -- my aunt's boat, a life jacket, swim toys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet as crazy as it seems to most people, Ike isn't going to scare us away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It isn't scaring off anybody else in San Leon, either. Our waterfront street was humming with activity. Property owners were dragging boards and branches and waterlogged furnishings to the street, piling them high for federal clean-up crews to haul away. Bulldozers and backhoes roared and scraped great loads of wreckage. Cleanup, the first stage of rebuilding, was in full swing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Everybody's rebuilding," said James "Gator" Miller, publisher of the local newspaper the Seabreeze News. "Nobody's said, 'we've had enough.'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, that includes my family members, who all plan to eventually rebuild.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the midst of the commotion, my husband and I didn't feel so out of place as we spread our blueprints out across the silt to review our plans with local homebuilder David Rompot. "Well," he said cheerfully, gesturing away from the mess toward the blue sky and water, "You've still got your view."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rompot had some good advice: build strong. We've designed the house based on current hurricane codes, including a bolted down roof, shuttered windows and raising the house 10-feet above the ground on pilings. Mr. Rompot also suggested we use 12-inch by 12-inch pilings instead of the 10-inch by 10-inch pilings we had planned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We know that building here is a big risk, and that any given year we could hit the hurricane lottery again. But since when was anyone in our society risk-averse? We risk our life when we drive on the freeway; we risk our health when we eat junk food; we risk losing our nest egg in our 401(k) investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All we are really risking in San Leon is the money we saved to build this house. And that pales against the prospect of losing the one place on earth that defines my family's sense of home. The best memories of my life are tied to the Bay, and I want my children -- and grandchildren -- to have the same life-shaping experiences here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides, we may get lucky. We may not see another Ike-like storm for another 90 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just in case, the day after we got back from San Leon, my husband Tony woke up at 5 a.m. and went to work on the house plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He's raising the house another two feet.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Lingling Wei and Paul Glader </div><div>1139 words</div><div>15 October 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Real Estate; B1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2008 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the real-estate market was booming, <span class="companylink">General Electric Co</span>.'s commercial-property business earned the nickname "the honey pot" among insiders because the company could increase earnings simply by selling a building or two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now, the opposite is true: GE's difficulty selling its office buildings, shopping centers and other commercial property is dragging down its financial results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower property sales contributed to earnings shortfalls at the Fairfield, Conn.-based conglomerate in both the first and third quarters. GE, whose $88.7 billion real-estate portfolio is one of the world's largest, posted a 62% decline in its third-quarter profit on real estate, to $244 million from $640 million a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop was one of the largest percentage declines for any of its business units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're not counting [on] any gains in the real-estate business in 2009," said Keith Sherin, GE's chief financial officer, during a conference call with analysts and investors last week. This year, GE hopes to earn between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion from its real-estate business. That's a sharp contrast with last year, when the roughly $2.3 billion in real-estate profit -- driven by sales of GE's property investments -- accounted for about 38% of earnings at the company's crown-jewel commercial-finance unit and 10% of total GE profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The real estate business has been a consistent performer for us," said a GE spokesman. "We have a strong and diversified real-estate portfolio with conservative underwriting."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Established in 1972, GE's real-estate division has both purchased property and offered loans to other investors. Its equity operation has operated like the real-estate arm of a pension fund, endowment or private-equity fund. It would buy a property, try to improve it and then sell it after holding it for three to five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that strategy has been hamstrung by the credit squeeze and economic downturn, which have driven down values while making it difficult and expensive for potential buyers to get financing. The few buyers who are out there expect big discounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GE isn't alone in its pain, which is also being felt by numerous financial institutions and real-estate funds that depend on maintaining a steady level of sales to meet their return projections. Some private-equity funds with big real estate investments are limiting redemptions by investors because they don't want to sell into such a bad market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling property values could also hurt GE by forcing it to take hits on its balance sheet. As of the end of last year, the estimated market value of its real-estate investments exceeded what the company had paid for the properties by about $3 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if, as expected, the commercial real-estate market continues to weaken, GE runs the risk of having to take a write-down on those investments. Nationwide, as office vacancies rise, retail sales slow and travel bookings plunge, commercial-property values have already fallen as much as 20% in many areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GE purchased many properties at the top of the market. According to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, a research firm in New York, the company sold $7 billion of real estate world-wide last year and acquired $16.6 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the notable deals: In July 2007, it bought nine office complexes in Chicago from Blackstone Group LP for $1.05 billion. Those properties had been owned by <span class="companylink">Equity Office Properties</span>, which Blackstone acquired for $39 billion at the beginning of 2007 and then sold off in large chunks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some other buyers who bought pieces of the Equity Office portfolio fared poorly. For example, New York developer Harry Macklowe was forced to liquidate a large portion of his real-estate empire this year because of the problems he took on when he bought seven of Equity Office's Manhattan office buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until now, GE's real-estate unit has performed well, with net-income growth exceeding 10% for 12 consecutive years. During the commercial real-estate collapse of the early 1990s, the company was a big winner, making billions of dollars by buying and selling distressed assets from the <span class="companylink">Resolution Trust Corp</span>., the government thrift-bailout agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real-estate business has been "a source of incremental growth" for the company for the past five years, says Nicholas Heymann, an analyst at Sterne Agee in New York. But now, he says, the company faces difficulty managing the typical cycle of buying and selling real estate. "The big issue is finding liquidity anywhere to allow them to sell these properties," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far this year, GE has sold $8 billion of real estate, and it plans to sell $6 billion to $10 billion more over the next 12 months. Many of the sales have involved properties overseas where the credit markets were sounder until recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers have typically been institutions that could finance deals with either their own cash or loans from insurance companies and other creditors that hold loans to maturity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the timing hasn't been so good for many of GE's sales in the U.S. For example, it sold an office complex in Santa Monica for $35.1 million in June, according to industry sources. That property probably would have been valued 15% to 20% higher a year ago, market participants say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To get many deals done in coming months, the company will probably have to offer financing, according to real-estate experts. GE has provided $700 million in so-called seller financing for the $8 billion of property it has sold this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as GE is paring its property holdings, it is beefing up its business of originating and investing in commercial real-estate debt to capitalize on the greater returns resulting from the cutback in lending by banks and other lending sources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far this year, GE has originated and invested in a total of $19 billion of commercial real-estate debt at a projected return on equity of about 25%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GE is known as a conservative underwriter, and delinquencies on its commercial-mortgage portfolio have so far remained very low. "As we muddle through the crisis, they're likely to be the strongest survivor," says Dan Gorczycki, a managing director at Savills Granite LLC, an investment-banking firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some analysts and investors worry that defaults could go up as the weakening economy and falling property values make it harder for borrowers to repay debt. "They have to have their eyes open for new businesses," says analyst Richard Hofmann at research firm CreditSights.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Gabriel Kahn and Peter Sanders </div><div>709 words</div><div>15 October 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>US; A8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2008 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOS ANGELES -- In the latest flare-up in a busy year for California fires, winds threatened to push a major wildfire south and west where it could rip through more-populated areas, including Simi Valley and Malibu, even as a second fire north of Los Angeles was brought under control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The blazes, along with another fire farther south, in San Diego County, are the first to erupt during what is typically the most intense period of Southern California's fire season. As more than 2,500 firefighters worked to contain the blazes, which have consumed more than 15,000 acres, warm Santa Ana winds risk kicking up new fires. That could force firefighters to spread their resources more thinly to cope with new threats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger declared a state of emergency in Los Angeles and Ventura counties, and more than 1,800 people were evacuated, though many were later allowed to return to their homes. The fires have resulted in one death and the loss of 50 structures, including homes and mobile homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of midday Tuesday, the Marek fire, which began early Sunday on national forest land, was 70% contained. But farther west, firefighters were battling to get the upper hand on a fire that started Monday morning and doubled in size overnight to nearly 10,000 acres. That fire, dubbed the Sesnon fire, was burning on the northwestern edges of the San Fernando Valley, creeping toward the Granada Hills neighborhood. Though fire officials appeared to be making progress, they cautioned that unpredictable winds could hamper their efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late autumn, when hot daytime temperatures combine with gusty winds, can create the most dangerous fires, but recently California has been dealing with blazes throughout the year. "It's fire season all year round now," Gov. Schwarzenegger said during a news conference Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already this year, 1.54 million acres -- an area roughly the size of Delaware -- have burned in California, compared with 1.52 million acres during 2007. That has been an added strain on the state's overstretched budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gov. Schwarzenegger sought Tuesday to reassure the public that the state still had adequate funds for firefighting. "Though we've had budget problems in our state and an economic slowdown, we don't spare one dollar when it comes to fighting fires," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, he said, the state spent an estimated $500 million on firefighting, an amount likely to be exceeded this year. While fires are a recurring problem in the state, last year's devastating fires in Southern California focused the public's attention on the danger, in part because the flames spread through more-populated areas, burning down more than 3,000 homes and claiming 10 lives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in the amount of land burned recently has forced local governments to shift resources to another problem: landslides. Burned areas are usually denuded of vegetation, so that hillsides can collapse under even moderate rainfall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Santa Barbara County, for example, the site of a fire this summer, is now girding for massive flooding and landslides that could run across Highway 101, the airport and sections of the city of Santa Barbara's downtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You can try to stop the fire, but you can't stop the flooding," said Santa Barbara County emergency-operations chief Michael Harris. He said the county expects it could be coping with 300,000 cubic yards of debris, or about 30,000 dump trucks' worth, and it has set up evacuation centers for residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the major fire in Santa Barbara County occurred in the summer, local officials had time to clear out streambeds and treat hundreds of acres via aerial hydromulching, in which planes spray an organic slurry mix over burned land that can help firm up weak soil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But fires that rage during October give authorities little time to prepare for mudslide damage that comes when the rainy season begins, typically in November.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Ruth Simon and Michael Corkery </div><div>930 words</div><div>15 October 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Real Estate; A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2008 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Treasury Department's rescue plan for the U.S. financial industry doesn't directly address the root cause of the crisis: falling home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government's plan, which includes taking stakes in major financial institutions and temporarily guaranteeing certain new bank debt, could cushion the economy and thus the housing market from further blows. But many economists say additional measures are needed to stimulate demand for homes and to reduce mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the heart of the rescue plan is an effort to keep the credit crunch from sending the economy into a tailspin. "If the financial system doesn't get working again, then the economic downturn is going to be much worse, and that means the housing market will be a lot worse than it otherwise would be," says Frederic Mishkin, a Columbia University economist who stepped down as a Federal Reserve Board governor in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some economists say the government needs to do more to address the underlying problems that triggered the credit crisis. "It's very disappointing" that the plan doesn't do anything "to stop the spiral in home prices," which is reducing net worth and creating a falloff in consumer spending, says Harvard University economist Martin Feldstein. He proposes that the federal government offer low-interest loans to replace 20% of homeowners' mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government's latest intervention comes as mortgage delinquencies continue to climb and home prices are plummeting in many markets. Some 5% of mortgages were at least 30 days past due at the end of the third quarter, according to Equifax and <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com, up from 4.6% in the second quarter and 3.5% a year earlier. In Florida and Nevada, delinquency rates now top 8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, house prices have fallen 18% from their peak in the first quarter of 2006, according to Case Shiller. By another measure, from the National Association of Realtors, home prices are off 12% from their peak. They are expected to fall an additional 10% to 15% between now and mid-2009, says Mark Zandi, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling prices are feeding a vicious cycle that leads to more mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures. As more Americans end up "under water," or owing more on homes than they are currently worth, more people are likely to walk away from mortgages, causing foreclosures to rise further and adding to negative market psychology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rescue effort could buy the government some time to get other measures up and running -- and to see whether they will help stabilize home prices. Some analysts say one government initiative that appears to be bearing fruit is the increase in loan limits of mortgages backed by the Federal Housing Administration -- to as high as $729,000 in some cities. In September, FHA mortgages financed 28% of home purchases, up from 19% in August, according to Zelman &amp;Associates, a housing research firm, and the number of buyers seeking government-backed mortgages more than doubled from last year, as houses have become affordable again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you want to buy a home, and you have enough money for a modest down payment, it's not that hard to get a mortgage today," says Thomas Lawler, a housing economist in Leesburg, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over time, the government's rescue effort could make it easier for borrowers in high-cost markets such as California, New York and Boston to get a mortgage by reducing rates for jumbo loans, those too big for government backing, says Richard K. Green, director of the Lusk Center for Real Estate Development at the University of Southern California. Rates on fixed-rate jumbo loans currently average 7.91%, according to HSH Associates, more than a full percentage point above rates on conforming loans eligible for government backing, which jumped nearly a third of a percentage point Tuesday to 6.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But fundamental problems remain. The supply of homes on the market remains stubbornly high, while demand for those homes remains relatively weak. Home builders, including Stuart Miller, chief executive of <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>., are lobbying for a $15,000 to $20,000 tax credit to spur demand, saying the $7,500 credit passed by Congress in July has failed to jump-start sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prof. Green says the government needs to push mortgage companies to take advantage of the Hope for Homeowners program, which aims to put borrowers into affordable loans, but requires they share any resulting price appreciation with the federal government. The program "pretty much gets the incentives right," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One problem with the refinancing program is that it will help only 400,000 troubled homeowners, according to some estimates, well short of the nearly 12 million Americans who owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth and are in danger of default.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Mayer, vice dean of Columbia Business School, says the government should push mortgage rates down to 5.25% in order to spur demand. Prof. Mayer has proposed that the government refinance homeowners who live in their homes, can document their income and show they can afford the new mortgage. When borrowers owe more than their homes are worth, he says, the government and the mortgage holder should share the write-down in equity when the loan is refinanced.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Jersey City's Boom Is Set Back</span>
</div><div class="author">By Dawn Wotapka </div><div>987 words</div><div>15 October 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Real Estate; B3B</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2008 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After years of speculative building, public-relations campaigns and plenty of dreams, Jersey City, N.J., is starting to resemble New York City's sixth borough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest residential boom in the Garden State city's history brought in thousands of residential units in recent years, and another 72,000 could come by 2050. Big brands including Trump, <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Hovnanian Enterprises Inc</span>. have put their stamps on the burgeoning skyline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The boom, however, comes as the worst housing correction in decades has turned into a credit crisis that has seen some of the financial sector's most storied names, such as <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns</span> and <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span>, crumble along with thousands of white-collar jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Jersey City is as much a part of the New York metropolitan area as any other municipality within a 10-mile radius of Wall Street," said Jamie LeFrak, whose family real-estate-development business, the LeFrak Organization, has helped guide Jersey City's transformation. "The whole [area] is going to feel negative effects in a way that's probably more significant than the rest of the country."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, New Jersey's second-largest city by population, which boasts 240,000 or so residents and as many as 40,000 financial-sector jobs, is waiting to see how much the current turmoil affects progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Until what's going on right now kind of settles, there's going to be a little bit of a lull," said Tom Pichi, director of sales for Metropolitan &amp;Waterfront Residential Brokerage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, train tracks and shipping warehouses bordering the Hudson River fed Jersey City's economy. However, after World War II, the railroads consolidated, manufacturing businesses fled and the area "just languished," Mr. Pichi said. "There was nothing here" .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the mid-1980s, the LeFrak Organization, considered one of the nation's largest private landlords, snapped up hundreds of acres stretching from Jersey City to Hoboken. The company first built five residential towers that took time to fill, as well as the Newport Centre Mall, developed with the Simon family behind <span class="companylink">Simon Property Group Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That's when Jersey City started to really just begin to lose its industrial nature and become a residential and white-collar commercial location," Mr. LeFrak said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Progress took a breather in the 1990s as the nation battled a recession. Then came the technology boom, which fueled the rise in Manhattan's office prices, pushing office users seeking cheaper rents across the river. That was one of the reasons why, in the late 1990s, the LeFraks took a risk and built more than two million square feet of speculative office space. It filled quickly with tenants including <span class="companylink">Cigna Corp</span>. and what is now <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;Co</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lord, Abbett &amp;Co</span>., a privately held investment-management firm, in 2000 moved its headquarters from the Big Apple to Jersey City's Hudson Street. The company, which sought room to expand, relocated with hundreds of employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That put us on the map," said Dan Frohwirth, director of real estate and marketing for the Jersey City Economic Development Corp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Light rail, meanwhile, arrived the same year. The Hoboken train station followed in September of 2002, Mr. Frohwirth said. The station proved useful in the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks, when companies and commuters were forced out of lower Manhattan and, in many cases, into and through Jersey City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Suddenly people knew what Jersey City was," Mr. Frohwirth said. "People who lived and worked in New York realized: 'I could live in Jersey City.'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That led to condominium development, fed by inexpensive capital to first-time developers and Wall Street bonuses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first, the units sold quickly (LeFrak's two condo projects had waiting lists), but things are changing: Nationwide unemployment continues to rise, some buyers are unable to sell existing homes and others are finding mortgages harder to obtain. Until now, the downturn had largely bypassed the Northeast, though the area is softening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not booming like it did," said Paul Silverman, who is working with his brother, Eric, to transform a former hospital into luxury condominiums, retail and commercial space. "People are scared [and asking] 'will I have my job a year from now? Should I commit to buying something?'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Locals don't seem overly concerned. "It's not the way it was a year ago," said Mayor Jerramiah Healy, "[but] we're still doing OK."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first phase of 323-unit Gull's Cove is 70% sold. Construction of Trump Plaza's 444 units was recently completed, and the project is 85% sold, according to developer Dean Geibel. Both projects have seen a cancellation rate of less than 5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Very few people have backed out [of deals], because prices in Jersey City have remained relatively stable," he said. "They don't want to walk away from good money."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Geibel plans a second Trump tower, but he is "waiting like everybody else for this financial hurricane to blow over." He expects to break ground in several months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span>' 230-unit 700 Grove, with two-bedroom units priced as high as $725,000, has closed on 85% of its units, said Ben Jogodnik, senior vice president for Toll's City Living division in Hoboken and Jersey City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The builder, based in Horsham, Pa., continues with its 950-unit Provost Square, though construction won't start for at least a year</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If things take a minute to repause, it's certainly not going to hurt," Mr. Jogodnik said. "The markets will ebb and flow, but the long-term prospects for Jersey City are outstanding."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is good news for Hovnanian, of Red Bank, N.J. Its first high-rise tower, the 44-story, 420-unit 77 Hudson, should see its first occupants next spring.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You know things are seriously messed up when even R. Glenn Hubbard and Chris Mayer, economists of otherwise impeccable conservative credentials, recommend government action to interfere with the price discovery mechanism of the housing market ("First, Let's Stabilize Home Prices," op-ed, Oct. 2).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices collapsed because old prices reached unsustainable levels. The public policy objective should not be to try to restore those old, unsustainable price levels. Losses incurred due to price drops from those old levels are real. In the long run that cannot be avoided by government action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem right now is not so much low housing prices as it is falling prices. People are reluctant to buy a house so long as they feel the market has further to fall. If the government were to be perceived as propping up housing prices, a legitimate pickup in housing activity and prices simply wouldn't happen.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ABC's "Bachelor" pad is now available for 33% off. The owner of the Los Angeles-area house, where contestants on the popular reality-TV show competed for love, is asking $8.75 million, down from just under $13 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The California real-estate market has softened, said listing agent Mark Miller of Barcode Properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the years of occasional filming, Marshall Haraden, who built the six-bedroom rustic Italian-style house in 2005, has lived in it. He designed the 8,000-square-foot house with materials from Morocco, India, China and Mexico in Agoura, Calif., near the western edge of Los Angeles county. The 10 acres include a studio of 4,000 square feet. The pool has a built-in bar and an arched "aqueduct" with several waterfalls and fountains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numerous seasons of the show and its "Bachelorette" spinoff are filmed in many places, but viewers may recognize the home's living room from the "rose ceremony," where the Bachelor or Bachelorette chooses which contestants will continue to the next round.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Firestone in Florida</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, philanthropist Carroll Petrie sold a Palm Beach, Fla., house for $3 million -- or $500,000 less than she paid less than a year earlier -- to investor John D. Firestone, of the tire-manufacturing family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Poinciana Park subdivision, the renovated 3,000-square-foot house is a block from the ocean and has four bedrooms, a pool, a guest house and a garage, on a quarter-acre lot. Mia Morrison of Sotheby's, who had the listing, said Mrs. Petrie wanted to sell the house quickly. Wally Turner, also of Sotheby's, represented Mr. Firestone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Petrie is trading up. In May, she paid $7.45 million for a 6,700-square-foot, five-bedroom home about a mile farther south on the barrier island. Jim McCann, of <span class="companylink">Corcoran Group</span>, had that listing. Mrs. Petrie has given tens of millions of dollars for New York City teacher training and other causes via a foundation named for her and her late retailer husband, Milton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Schnabel Trims Price of Manhattan Condo</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Manhattan, artist-turned-developer Julian Schnabel has cut the price on the triplex penthouse in his Palazzo Chupi condominium building to $24 million, down 25% from last spring's original price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The West Village building drew attention for its bright pink exterior, its eye-popping prices and dramatic design by Mr. Schnabel. He first asked $32 million for the three-bedroom, 3,700- square-foot condo, which has 13-foot ceilings, terraces and Hudson River views. A similarly sized duplex just below is also for sale, with an asking price of $23 million. Maria Pashby, of <span class="companylink">Corcoran Group</span>, has both listings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The story is that Julian is committed to selling it," says James Lansill, of Corcoran Sunshine Group, who is assisting in marketing the five-unit building, which has a private pool and parking. The price is roughly $6,500 per square foot, which would set a downtown record. Last year, actor Richard Gere paid $12 million for a unit there, but relisted it for $18 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, Mr. Schnabel has erected scaffolding outside the building. When asked about the work, Mr. Lansill said. "It's an effort to perfect the aesthetic appearance. It's going to be a similar color, but the goal is a more consistent finish."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was so refreshing to read Janet Albrechtsen's " Not Everyone Should Own a Home [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122325772150706655.html]" (op-ed, Oct. 6). She is absolutely correct that U.S. government policies contributed significantly to the housing bubble. An important lesson for our friends in Washington is that well-intended polices and regulations, while seemingly desirable in the short term, frequently bring unwanted long-term costs which far outweigh their intended benefit. The important lessons of the mortgage crisis can be found in four government policies:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1) Nonrecourse lending gives investors incentives to take risks beyond what they would bear on their own balance sheet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2) The transfer of credit risk to GSEs like Fannie and Freddie discourages credit analysis and incentivizes lending volume.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3) Aggressive Federal Reserve polices to fight inflation or seek full employment lead to higher short-term interest rate volatility, increasing the uncertainty of mortgage payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4) The mortgage interest deduction favors owners over renters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bottom line is that all four polices inflated real estate values. If the policy goals were to make housing more affordable, they in fact delivered the opposite effect by inflating prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just like Australians, Americans love their homes and our economy will be stronger for all Americans if we encourage each homeowner to invest in a fairly priced house in a responsible fashion. Before Congress considers new regulations to protect us from the next financial crisis, they could serve their constituents well by not repeating the mistakes of the past.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I agree completely that not everyone is able to afford a home. However, Ms. Albrechtsen does not understand that all that easy money was not distributed out of the goodness of our collective hearts, but instead was designed to keep developers developing and builders building and refrigerator (and mortgage) salesmen flush. The American economy is based on building houses and then finding people to buy them. We will only stop when we run out of land or people. We did run out of people with money and look what happened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I do not know with what we will replace this shell game. Maybe Ms. Albrechtsen could tell us how they keep the economy moving in Australia.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is that Generations X and Y lack the ability to defer gratification. The World War II generation worked, saved and scrimped in order to some day realize their dream of homeownership. My own parents were in their late 30s before they were able to realize their dream of owning their home. Today, young people in their 20s seem to feel entitled to own homes, cars, appliances, etc., Their parents and grandparents could not afford similar items until they were much older and had built their finances through hard work and frugal living.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the financial crisis and the housing slump, the phone is still ringing in Peter Gluck's office. "We're OK for now," says Mr. Gluck, whose office of 50 architects specializes in high-end residences costing $5 million and up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That may be explained by the fact that Mr. Gluck and his associates aren't just the architects for their homes. They're the general contractors as well, unlocking gates in the morning and stepping onto scaffolds to direct construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This architect-as-contractor model, called design-build, had already been gaining new traction at the highest echelons of the housing market, as clients seek ways to execute cutting-edge designs without the headaches often associated with such construction. Membership in the American Institute of Architects' design-build community has nearly tripled over the past five years, and teachers at several architecture programs across the Midwest report that enrollment in design-build classes has doubled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while critics argue that allowing one firm to handle both design and construction duties could result in out-of-control costs, advocates argue the opposite, saying double-duty firms are faring better in tough times because it's easier for them to keep costs in check. "The design-build process may be as close to a fixed cost contract that an owner can expect in today's construction world," writes Barry B. LePatner, a prominent construction lawyer, in his "Broken Buildings, Busted Budgets: How to Fix America's Trillion-Dollar Construction Industry."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases, the savings have been significant. In midtown Manhattan, a client hired Mr. Gluck's firm to tear down an old brownstone and replace it with one with a loft-like interior. Four months away from completion, the townhouse boasts stone counters, a four-story bookcase, glass stair railings, an elevator, a double-height dining room, a roof deck and an all-glass back façade. The cost: $1.95 million. At $550 per square foot, the townhouse costs nearly half of what experienced builders say it would cost to tear down and rebuild a townhouse with lesser-quality finishes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, the vast majority of buildings are still built the conventional way, with an architect drawing up plans that the client bids out to general contractors. And for many years, the idea of marrying architects to contractors was viewed with deep suspicion. The American Institute of Architects banned its members from doing design-build from its founding in 1857 until 1979.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some skeptics still believe the practice is unethical, saying it is a conflict of interest for designers to determine a building's budget. "In theory clients like it because it sort of simplifies their life. But they're paying with one less level of protection and oversight," says New York architect Richard Dattner. "There's either a conflict or an appearance of a conflict."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And not all architects are anxious to change their roles. Taking out a second insurance policy to cover architects as general contractors isn't cheap. Some architects dislike the less glamorous parts of the job: scaling ladders, negotiating labor contracts, dealing with inclement weather and occasionally hauling trash to a dump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But design-build advocates argue the conventional method is problematic. When builders run into situations that aren't explained in the drawings, they wait for the architects' office to resolve the issue or they engineer a solution themselves, even if their fix doesn't mesh with the architect's original design. In either case, the homeowner is saddled with change orders, delays or a compromised design. And when things go wrong, as they often will, architects and general contractors often blame each other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People hire an architect they don't know and hire builders who gave them the lowest bid and they sit there and pray," says New York developer Jeffrey M. Brown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Richard Yulman hired an architect to design a copper-clad guesthouse next to his vacation home in Lake George, N.Y., he steeled himself for months of headache. After all, his experience with an architect 15 years earlier had been fraught with disagreements between the designer and contractor and finger-pointing afterward when his new glass roof leaked. "It was a terrible experience," recalls Mr. Yulman, the 63-year-old retired chairman of mattress maker Serta International.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yulman hired Mr. Gluck in 2005. "When I'm not happy, there's one phone call I make," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Skip Paul remodeled and restored three architectural homes, each time hiring separate designers and builders. Last year, the entertainment executive hired Marmol Radziner + Associates to design a Modernist home in Beverly Hills, Calif., with terrazzo flooring, stack-stone fireplaces and an open kitchen-living-dining space enclosed by a glass facade offering views of Los Angeles. Although the firm usually builds its own projects, Mr. Paul still wanted a general contractor. "I didn't want a bunch of architects to build my house," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But over time, Mr. Paul became impressed with how the architects used their construction knowledge to push the design, so he asked them to bid on the entire project. The firm came up with an amount similar to general contractors, and after watching the contractors leaf through the drawings and puzzle over complex features like the three different roofs that appear to float atop the house, Mr. Paul decided to stick with the architects. "I will end up with the house I wanted for less money," says Mr. Paul.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many architects became their own contractors out of frustration. After doing architectural restorations of several leaky houses designed by Frank Gehry, Leo Marmol and Ron Radziner became convinced that traditional building methods wouldn't work on daring architecture. About a dozen of their former staffers have left over the years to start up their own firms, building their own designs. (Mr. Gehry could not be reached to comment on these projects.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Omaha, Neb., architect Randy Brown was tired of spending extra hours helping his clients' general contractors find subcontractors willing to build the warped walls or custom millwork he had designed. "We were doing all the work of the general contractor and not getting paid for it," recalls Mr. Brown, who took on his first house as an architect-contractor in 1998.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To keep subcontractors' estimates on budget early on, Mr. Gluck uses extremely detailed drawings. Rather than giving the subcontractors one giant roll of drawings to thumb through to determine their estimates, Mr. Gluck puts together an individual set of drawings for each trade. It's a lot of extra work -- as many as 30 different sets of drawings for one project -- but it eliminates guesswork and costly change orders. The drawings get into such mundane details as where to place screws and caulking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To assure his clients that they're not being taken for a ride, Mr. Gluck keeps his payrolls transparent. His clients have online access to his ledgers through a secure server. Subcontractors' bids, payments, daily work orders and pictures from the jobsite are uploaded daily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond homeowners, Mr. Gluck says the architect-as-contractor model goes a long way towards making architecture affordable for nonprofits and schools, which make up about half of his portfolio. That said, Mr. Gluck doesn't expect to be entirely immune from the current economic climate. "Nobody's canceling projects, but that's probably because lot of ours are in construction. We can't just stop those," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He hopes that he'll have enough work to keep his office busy through the downturn, but he does note he hasn't signed any new residential clients in the last month.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A gauge of future home sales took a surprising jump in August, a positive sign amid the sluggish housing market but one that came before the financial crisis deepened last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors' index for pending sales of previously owned homes rose 7.4% to 93.4 from 87 in July. The pending-sales index, designed to gauge the market's direction, is based on signed contracts for previously owned homes. The transactions typically close a month or two after signing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts had projected a decline of 1.5% in August, a month in which fears about the health of mortgage giants <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> weighed heavily on mortgage markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Vulture investors buying foreclosed homes are likely the key driver of the rise, but sales are sales and they all take inventory off the market," said Ian Shepherdson, an analyst at High Frequency Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gauge had gone down 2.7% during July; that's a revision up from a previously estimated 3.2% decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, said home buyers were responding to improved affordability. "What we're seeing is the momentum of people taking advantage of low home prices, with pending-home sales up strongly in California, Nevada, Arizona, Florida, Rhode Island and the Washington, D.C., region," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The improvement also reflects the drop in mortgage interest rates after the government takeover of <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>," Mr. Yun said. "It's unclear how much contract activity may be impacted by the credit disruptions on Wall Street, but we're hopeful most of the increase will translate into closed existing-home sales."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its monthly forecast on the industry, the NAR projected existing-home sales at 5.04 million this year and 5.41 million in 2009. That compares with 5.65 million sales in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for an existing home is seen at $200,700 in 2008 and $206,300 in 2009. It was $218,900 in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A month ago, the NAR forecast 2008 sales at 5.01 million and 2009 sales at 5.35 million. The 2008 median price was projected at $203,600 and the 2009 price at $208,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR pending sales index, based on signed contracts for previously owned homes, was 8.8% above the level of 85.8 in August 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR's pending home sales index was designed to try measuring which way the housing market is going in the future. It is based on pending sales of existing homes, including single-family homes and condominiums. A home sale is pending when the contract has been signed but the transaction hasn't closed. Pending sales typically close within one or two months of signing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By region, pending sales in the Northeast increased 8.4% in August from July; they were up 2.0% since August 2007. Midwest activity rose 3.6% in August from July; it climbed 6.6% since August 2007. Activity in the South increased 2.3% in August from July; it fell 2.1% since August 2007. In the West pending sales surged 18.4% in August from July; they were up 37.8% since August 2007.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's the latest trend that started in California and is spreading to the rest of the country: recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's all but certain the U.S. economy is in a recession, as falling home prices and Wall Street turmoil have put the brakes on consumer spending and stoked unemployment. But California got there first. Now, the state provides a template of how a broad U.S. downturn could look.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With its export businesses, manufacturing sector, professional services and big retail employers, California looks like many other U.S. states, only more so. California's $1.8 trillion economy -- twice the size of India's and accounting for about 15% of the U.S. gross domestic product -- is powerful enough to have ripple effects nationally. It is home to Hollywood, five of 30 Major League Baseball franchises and the largest farming sector in the nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California was also at the leading edge of the nation's recent housing bubble, which is where its current problems started. Home prices in California rose higher and faster than in most of the U.S., and started weakening earlier, in 2005. Some mortgage-holders defaulted. Others struggle along under a mountain of debt. The problems spread to the state's financial sector, which was heavily exposed to local real estate. As Californians cut their spending, job losses spread from the housing sector to retail stores and auto dealers. Now the state's unemployment rate is 7.7%, among the highest in the nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with Sunbelt states such as Florida and Nevada, California is a big source of the shocks now working through the world's banks, corporations and stock markets. The financial crisis has frozen credit markets, cutting into companies' ability to engage in even the day-to-day borrowing they need to run their businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even before the most recent blows to the national economy, Californians were feeling the downward drag of a consumer-led recession -- in which shrinking home values caused people to rein in their spending, fueling unemployment and, in turn, sparking further spending cuts and joblessness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Luc has seen how housing problems bleed into the broader economy. Mr. Luc is the 36-year-old manager of Homestore Furniture in Ontario, a middle-class community 40 miles east of Los Angeles and one of the centers of the housing bust. Since last year, retail sales have fallen, while unemployment and office vacancies have soared. Eighteen months ago, he watched a nearby Levitz furniture store close down in a bankruptcy sale. Since then, he said, the few buyers who've visited his store ask for discounts. "Everybody negotiates," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other day, Mr. Luc was presiding over the store's going-out-of-business sale. Although the father of two young children expects to get a job at another Homestore outlet, he and his wife have checked their spending. He says he saves $50 or more each week by packing a lunch each day, and he makes coffee at home instead of stopping at <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span> during his long commute. "I haven't gone into a steakhouse like a Black Angus for dinner in six to eight months," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer spending accounts for about 70% of U.S. economic activity, so as people like Mr. Luc cut back, job losses and other economic woes follow. In the third quarter of 2007, California's taxable sales declined 1.82% from the year-earlier period, the first annual decline since 2002. Taxable sales have fallen every quarter since. Now in addition to construction workers and mortgage brokers, people like retail clerks, accountants and information-technology consultants are losing their jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A similar dynamic is playing out nationally. Retail sales recently started declining, after peaking in June. Rising job losses appear likely to cut into future sales. In September, the U.S. economy shed 159,000 workers from its payrolls. The unemployment rate was 6.1%, compared with 4.7% a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's no universal definition of recession, and little agreement of what constitutes one in a state economy. But by most measures economists use -- rising job losses, shrinking consumer sales -- California fits the bill. "There is no question that this area is in a recession," says John Husing, an economist in Redlands, Calif., who tracks the Inland Empire region east of Los Angeles. "We're the canary in the mine shaft."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's unclear whether the state, as one of the first to enter an economic slowdown, will be among the first to emerge. Problems in the broader economy could also hit California in a second wave. Stephen Levy, director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy, expects the state's economy to get worse before it gets better. He expects job loss to continue through 2009, as consumers continue to pull back. While the housing sector probably won't fall much further, Mr. Levy said, many consumers aren't able to tap the equity in their homes for purchases. Falling stock prices and expensive gasoline and food will continue to eat into spending, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not Always a Bellwether</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California isn't always a bellwether for the nation's economy. In fact, in the past two national recessions, the state was stung by sharp job losses in important industries -- aerospace and defense in the early 1990s, and technology in the early 2000s -- but was among the last group of states to succumb to recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this time around, after years of double-digit price rises, median home prices stood far above what a household with a median income could afford. Permits for new homes began dropping sharply in fall 2005, something that didn't happen for the nation as a whole until spring 2006. Home prices in the state's largest real-estate markets fell earlier and further than those countrywide. Prices in San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego are currently down an average of 28% from their 2006 levels, compared with 19% for the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller 20-City Composite Home Price index nationally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mortgage-lending frenzy was at its hottest in California, and the state's financial firms were at the forefront of extending untraditional mortgages that were then folded into complex securities. Those firms were also among the first to face disaster when the value of those securities collapsed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April of last year, <span class="companylink">New Century Financial Corp</span>., a subprime lender in Irvine, filed for bankruptcy protection. Four months later, Calabasas-based <span class="companylink">Countrywide Financial Corp</span>. was at the center of the credit-market convulsions. The fallout continued into this year: When federal regulators seized Pasadena-based <span class="companylink">IndyMac Bancorp Inc</span>. in July, it was the third-biggest U.S. bank failure to date.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California's losses prefigured the later fallout on Wall Street. Through August, California had seen finance-related jobs fall 6.8% over the past two years, compared with 1.5% nationally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California's consumers are among the country's most indebted. For every dollar they take home, Californians spend about 19 cents on mortgages, cars, credit cards and other debt payment, compared with about 15 cents nationally, according to Equifax and <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com. As consumers pay down that debt, there will be less left over for purchases, which is better in the long run for the economy's health but hard on retailers now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pool and Pet Toys</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With banks tightening the flow of credit, even companies with rising consumer demand are having a hard time expanding. For the past decade, CoopSport in Vista has sold its beach, pool and pet toys mostly in specialty retailers. But last month, it received orders for the first time from mass merchants <span class="companylink">Target Corp</span>., <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart Stores Inc</span>. and Toy "R" Us Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past, says owner Scott Cooper, CoopSport was able to get credit from its Chinese factories at an annual interest rate of about 10%. But as the credit crisis spreads globally, Chinese factory owners won't provide him the usual financing. He also can't get the credit he needs from the U.S. banks he has contacted. So he has stitched together loans from a series of nontraditional lenders, which charge as much as 18% annual interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cooper says he has sold a 7.5% equity stake to raise additional capital to fund the expansion. Far from adding staff as he gets ready to expand, CoopSport eliminated eight warehouse workers and two office staff. The company further cut costs by switching to a cheaper box manufacturer and a cheaper truck company. "It's all the things you do when you go into survival mode in this economy," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California's big technology sector could also get hit hard by slowing overseas growth and the troubled financial sector. Santa Clara-based semiconductor-equipment manufacturer <span class="companylink">Applied Materials Inc</span>., for example, fetches more than 80% of its revenue from overseas sales. And financial firms are among the technology sector's biggest customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, even in recession California has its strengths. With its universities producing new technologies and entrepreneurial talent, the state has a disproportionate share of well-paying jobs in sectors like telecommunications, biotechnology and energy-efficient technology. Its health-care sector, like that of the rest of the U.S., has continued to add jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exports also have been a bright spot as a weak U.S. dollar has made goods cheaper abroad. The ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles are the nation's two largest, and have seen a rising stream of goods headed overseas. Through August this year, 22% more full containers were shipped out of the ports combined, compared with the first eight months of last year. With the world economy slowing, exports are expected to slow locally and across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists also believe the state's housing market may hit bottom before the rest of the nation's, and could start an upward tick earlier as well. The loss of construction and finance jobs has slowed. In San Diego, one of the first housing markets to falter, home prices are roughly in line with the city's incomes and rental rates. "Housing is becoming affordable again," said Steve Cochrane, an economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trouble in Stockton</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pain of the housing bust has been harder on inland areas than it has been in coastal cities such as San Francisco and Los Angeles, which generally have more high-paying jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stockton, a bedroom community to the Bay Area known for its asparagus festival, saw a boom in home-building and subprime loans this decade. Now, median home values are down nearly 50% from the market's peak, according to real-estate information service Zillow.com. Stockton's unemployment rate has risen 2.8 percentage points, to 10.3% over the past two years. In San Francisco, which has a greater concentration of jobs in areas like technology and professional services, the unemployment rate has risen 1.1 percentage point, to 5.1% over the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Bay Area, the creep of economic weakness unfolds in an hour's drive from the San Francisco exurbs. Cities like Antioch and Brentwood, past the last stop on the BART commuter rail line, are among the hardest hit by the housing bust. Closer to the coast are Concord and Walnut Creek, two San Francisco suburbs that have previously thrived with light industrial and office buildings that are a lower-cost alternative to downtown San Francisco and the Silicon Valley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, downtown Walnut Creek's commercial vacancy rate for Class A space has risen to 14.7% from 9.9% last year. Concord's commercial vacancy rate has jumped to 21% from 9.5% in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ed Del Beccaro, an office broker and senior managing partner at Colliers International in Walnut Creek, says his office's income is down about 20% this year. Mr. Del Beccaro cut four of his 38 brokers in January. Others, he says, have left for "real jobs" because their commissions were so low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Car Sales Down</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As East Bay consumers have struggled, so has Darren Anderson, whose family owns Lehmer's Buick Pontiac GMC in Concord. Mr. Anderson says Buick Pontiac GMC dealers in Northern California sold about 1,000 cars in August, compared with around 1,900 last year. In the past few months, Lehmer's has cut 10 of its roughly 50 employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As sales fall, so have the taxes collected by California governments, whose spending can offer a buffer during times of economic weakness. Through the first three quarters of this year, California's sales tax revenue is down about 5% compared with the first three quarters of 2007. Ongoing budget troubles resulted in a $15 billion deficit this year for California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Budget troubles are déj` vu for many Californians. In the aftermath of the dot-com bust, falling incomes and stock-market losses created a $38 billion budget deficit, and the ensuing furor sparked a recall election that brought current Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's budget troubles are potentially even worse than in the late 1990s: Falling home prices have reduced property taxes on which local governments depend, at a time when the state is cutting aid to municipalities. Also, the credit crunch has made it harder to sell bonds to fund longer-term capital projects such as roads and schools.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Vernon L. Smith </div><div>1547 words</div><div>9 October 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Opinion; A17</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2008 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2006 the U.S. economy has exhibited the features of a crash following a classic bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the bulge was not precipitated by general stock-market excesses nor by an economy-wide bubble-crash. The excesses were focused in the housing and related financial markets -- banks, mortgage, and insurance companies -- starting in 1998 and accelerating to 2006. This created the mother of all housing bubbles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">True, the crash has been exacerbated by the increase in oil prices, up from a mere $12 a barrel in 1998, to $90 in January 2008, then a spike to $147 in July. But the economy has rolled tolerably well under that punch, and it does not pose the systemic risk of the housing debacle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing is one-third of all U.S. wealth, totaling $19.4 trillion in the second quarter of 2008, according to the Federal Reserve. Almost all of the mortgage debt on those assets will be paid. Only a subset of homes funded recently with low down payments at unsustainable prices are at risk. All of you who rent -- a respectable American tradition -- can look forward to buying more cheaply in the future. Take your time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing disaster-in-motion was widely reported, complete with warnings, before the crash. But every word fell on deaf ears, because bubbles are never about reason, cool calculation and courageous politicians willing to risk defeat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 2005 Alan Greenspan and others were warning that <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> had become seriously undercapitalized and had persistently over-accumulated high risk mortgage paper. That paper was created by an industry reluctant to hold its own brainchild, but which responded to home buyers chasing an appreciating capital asset driven by their own ebullient expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover all parties have long believed that the obligations of Fan and Fred were backed by the Treasury's deep pockets -- that's you and me who pay taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We need to minimize systemic and taxpayer risk. Fortunately the two are entwined. Serve the needs of the former and you protect the taxpayer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why is this crash a classic?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- A "liquidity crisis." In every market, there is ultimately only one source of liquidity: buyers. And this is what central bankers hope to see return when they speak euphemistically of "restoring confidence."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All other sources of liquidity are stop gaps, bridges, band aids, and now a duct-tape bailout. Every seller in dire need of a buyer is in a liquidity crisis, even if he is a gainfully employed homeowner whose job security requires a move, or a fundamentally solvent bank, holding secured mortgage paper, but in need of immediate cash. Both now find that yesterday's buyers are in hiding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sale is always an "expectations equilibrium" -- a buyer only accepts a seller's instrument (agrees to a sale) if she believes that others will also accept it. Disequilibrium bubble-crash principles have been intensively studied in laboratory environments for over two decades (see Jerry Bishop's article in The Wall Street Journal on my work in this field " Stock Market Experiment Suggests Inevitability of Booms and Busts [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122360084765021629.html]," Nov. 17, 1987).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- During a bubble buyers are everywhere. Then, suddenly, they disappear, waiting, watching, delaying, reluctant to buy assets that others might not. That buyers will disappear in a bubble is predictable, what is never predictable is the timing. In his 1933 inaugural address, President Franklin Roosevelt said "the only thing we have to fear is fear itself." Yes, but the return of fearful buyers is just as unpredictable as the timing of their disappearance. And only the most arrogant will pretend to know what public policies will restore buyer "confidence."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- Cash is not scarce. Cash is just justifiably hard to loosen, and this makes it king. There are only three kinds of buyers in a downside housing/mortgage or equities market: those who buy too soon; the few who roll an 11 at the bottom; and those who are too spooked to buy until well after the crisis is over, if ever. Warren Buffet may be either too soon or about right. If he is too soon, it won't be his first time. The point is that no one can know.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starting in 2007, the Fed under Ben Bernanke, did all the right things expected of a central banker facing liquidity problems in the finance/housing sector. He even risked inflation by making it easy for banks to borrow from each other and the Fed. (The dollar did temporarily fall as commodities spiked upward.) But the action failed to solve the problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The early evidence came when Countrywide crashed and burned last year. But as English economist Sir Dennis Robertson would have put it over 60 years ago, the Fed was "pushing on a string" that only buyers can pull. Further deterioration set in, and nothing terrorizes a central banker more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enter a bipartisan Keynesian-inspired Congress and administration, who authorized Treasury to write large numbers of small checks as part of a "stimulus" package to many people who do not pay taxes. People spent the money at <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span>. Much of it went to China (which recycled it into U.S. bonds). And we saw a blip in retail sales that just delayed the inevitable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So Mr. Bernanke took the only action left: He got Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson into the action. Better two scared leaders at the top than one. They went to Congress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the result was the House's "Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008," a bureaucratic nightmare that fails to use auction markets in a way that will minimize both taxpayer and systemic risk. The key flawed provision states "The [Treasury] Secretary is authorized to purchase, and make and fund commitments to purchase, troubled assets from any financial institution as are determined by the Secretary."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Excuse me, did I read "any?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senate spelled it out more clearly: "troubled assets are not limited to mortgage related assets but could include auto loans, credit card debt, student loans or any other paper related to commercial loans."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Any other paper?" Heaven help us! Fortunately, Mr. Paulson still has some good sense. But no wonder the bailout bill is authorized at $700 billion. For a little perspective, consider that in August, MarketWatch reported that there are 4.67 million existing homes for sale, at a median price of $212,400 for a total of just under a trillion dollars. With a 30% loan, Treasury could buy them all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Auction designers should immediately note that we are talking about a market with one buyer and many sellers of a hodge-podge of items. The mechanism that will be used is a "reverse auction" -- with sellers competitively submitting asking prices to sell Treasury a heterogeneous mix of good, some sour, apples and oranges whose content is better known to sellers than the Treasury.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treasury expertise is in auctioning Treasury securities of a given maturity to multiple competing buyers: say $10 billion worth of six-month bills, or two-year notes. In either case every bill (or note) is identical to every other one. The only uncertainty is the final clearing price and Treasury is assured that it will get the best price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treasury has no expertise in this ridiculous new venture. (Auction houses such as Christie's and Sotheby's have no problem with heterogeneous items. They auction them singly or in small assemblies to multiple buyers, who assess the items and make bids that reflect best estimates of true value.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treasury action should focus on providing capital to individual banks and mortgage companies in return for debt, convertible bonds and equity and warrants to be negotiated. This is dangerous enough for the taxpayer, but here Mr. Paulson has previous experience. (The model was demonstrated recently when Treasury and the FDIC assisted <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span>'s takeover of <span class="companylink">Washington Mutual</span>.) Then let companies do any necessary piecemeal paper asset auctions, while Treasury holds managers accountable. This is feasible at least, if hardly risk-free for taxpayers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This procedure will confront financial systemic risk, and allow prices to emerge competitively that will encourage the all important return of bargain hunting buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Would the procedure work? I don't know. But it does focus on the knowledge that markets are capable of bringing to the table. The bailout does not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the extent that the bailout shores up existing home prices and its paper, it delays the inevitable. It does not assure the early return of buyers. Look at the course of home prices since 1987 in the nearby chart. Do you think the price decline has run its course since it turned the corner in 2006, then plummeted in 2007-2008?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shoring up prices to prevent a further debasement of overly generous loans is not designed to bring back buyers of homes and mortgage paper. But there is good news: homes, stocks, crude oil, copper, corn, soy beans, wheat, lumber and even ethanol are now cheaper.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes listed for sale declined slightly in many metropolitan areas last month. But inventories remain well above normal levels, and foreclosures continue to weigh on home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of homes available for sale in 29 major metropolitan areas in September was down 1.6% from a month earlier, according to figures compiled by ZipRealty Inc., a real-estate brokerage firm based in Emeryville, Calif. The ZipRealty data cover all single-family homes, condominiums and town houses listed on local multiple-listing services in metro areas where the firm operates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a national basis, home inventories typically decline in September from August. Over the past 25 years, the average decline during September has been 3%, according to Zelman &amp;Associates, a research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, 4.26 million previously occupied homes were listed for sale at the end of August, according to the National Association of Realtors.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A gauge of future home sales took a surprising jump in August, a positive sign amid the sluggish housing market but one that came before the financial crisis deepened last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors' index for pending sales of previously owned homes rose 7.4% to 93.4 from 87 in July. The pending-sales index, designed to gauge the market's direction, is based on signed contracts for previously owned homes. The transactions typically close a month or two after signing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts had projected a decline of 1.5% in August, a month in which fears about the health of mortgage giants <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> weighed heavily on mortgage markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Vulture investors buying foreclosed homes are likely the key driver of the rise, but sales are sales and they all take inventory off the market," said Ian Shepherdson, an analyst at <span class="companylink">High Frequency Economics</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes listed for sale declined slightly in many metropolitan areas last month. But inventories remain well above normal levels, and foreclosures continue to weigh on home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of homes available for sale in 29 major metropolitan areas in September was down 1.6% from a month earlier, according to figures compiled by ZipRealty Inc., a real-estate brokerage firm based in Emeryville, Calif. The ZipRealty data cover all single-family homes, condominiums and town houses listed on local multiple-listing services in metro areas where the firm operates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a national basis, home inventories typically decline in September from August. Over the past 25 years, the average decline during September has been 3%, according to Zelman &amp;Associates, a research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, 4.26 million previously occupied homes were listed for sale at the end of August, according to the National Association of Realtors.

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty and Ruth Simon </div><div>1321 words</div><div>8 October 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Economy; A5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2008 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The relentless slide in home prices has left nearly one in six U.S. homeowners owing more on a mortgage than the home is worth, raising the possibility of a rise in defaults -- the very misfortune that touched off the credit crisis last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result of homeowners being "under water" is more pressure on an economy that is already in a downturn. No longer having equity in their homes makes people feel less rich and thus less inclined to shop at the mall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And having more homeowners under water is likely to mean more eventual foreclosures, because it is hard for borrowers in financial trouble to refinance or sell their homes and pay off their mortgage if their debt exceeds the home's value. A foreclosed home, in turn, tends to lower the value of other homes in its neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 75.5 million U.S. households own the homes they live in. After a housing slump that has pushed values down 30% in some areas, roughly 12 million households, or 16%, owe more than their homes are worth, according to <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The comparable figures were roughly 4% under water in 2006 and 6% last year, says the firm's chief economist, Mark Zandi, who adds that "it is very possible that there will ultimately be more homeowners under water in this period than any time in our history."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among people who bought within the past five years, it's worse: 29% are under water on their mortgages, according to an estimate by real-estate Web site Zillow.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The majority of homeowners still have equity, and even among those who don't, many continue to make their mortgage payments on time. The financial-bailout legislation could at least "keep things from getting much worse" by helping banks avoid the need to tighten credit further, says Celia Chen, director of housing economics at Economy.com. Still, she expects housing credit to remain tight and home prices to decline in much of the country for another year or so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices are back to 2003 levels in the San Diego and Boston metropolitan areas, and back to 2004 levels in Las Vegas, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and Minneapolis, according to First American CoreLogic, a data firm in Santa Ana, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephanie and Jason Kirschenman thought they were being prudent when they agreed in late 2004 to buy a new four-bedroom home in Lodi, Calif., for $458,000. They put a substantial 20% down and chose a loan with a fixed interest rate for the first 10 years. Two years later, they took out a second mortgage to pay off some bills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, the home was appraised for about $550,000. But a mortgage broker recently estimated its value at well below the $380,000 the family owes on it, says Ms. Kirschenman. "We were quite shocked," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kirschenmans, who both work for a company that makes trailer hitches, thought about sending the keys to the lender. But their financial planner, Christopher Olsen, helped persuade them to stick with the house, noting that they could still afford the payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others aren't so lucky. Among mortgages on one- to four-family homes, 9.16% were a month or more overdue or were in foreclosure in the second quarter, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. That compared with 6.52% a year before and was the highest level since the association began such surveys 39 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling values have contributed to a sharp pullback in mortgage lending. In the third quarter, mortgage lending fell to the lowest level in eight years -- down 44% in a year -- says the publication Inside Mortgage Finance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason is that as home values slip, growing numbers of would-be borrowers lack sufficient equity to refinance. The falling values also make mortgage lending look riskier to banks, spurring them to tighten credit standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most mortgages in default were issued in 2006 and 2007, when lending standards were loosest and the housing market was peaking. Many who bought then made small down payments or none, so they had little equity in their homes from the start.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The performance of loans made earlier is getting worse, too, as price declines deplete the equity people built up. In Las Vegas, 6% of home loans made in 2004 are now 30 days or more overdue, up from 3.7% a year earlier, according to research firm LPS Applied Analytics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, Congress enacted legislation designed to help borrowers who owe more than their homes are worth by allowing them to refinance into a government-backed loan, provided their mortgage company forgives part of their principal. It's not clear how many borrowers the program will help, because before reducing the principal, lenders would almost always try first to freeze or reduce borrowers' interest rate to make payments more affordable, says Tom Deutsch, deputy executive director of the American Securitization Forum, an industry group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast with the 12 million home borrowers estimated to be under water, 64 million have equity in their homes. These include 24 million households who own their homes free and clear, and 40 million whose homes remain worth more than is owed on them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, some borrowers fret that declining prices and tighter lending standards could make it hard for them to tap their equity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steven Schneider, a mortgage broker in Miami, bought his home at the end of 1992. When he refinanced about four years ago, he pulled out $150,000 in cash that he intended to use to build an addition. The transaction raised his total debt to about $350,000, at a time when his home had a value of about $650,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, Mr. Schneider pulled out roughly $90,000 by tapping a home-equity line of credit. He says he put the funds in a money-market account that yields less than the 5% interest rate on the loan. "I was afraid they were going to shut down" access to the credit line, says Mr. Schneider. He figures his home, once valued at $750,000, now is worth about $600,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How much pain homeowners feel varies greatly from place to place. The most severe drops in home values are in parts of California, Florida, Nevada, Arizona and other areas where speculation pushed prices up and builders far overestimated demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within metro areas, neighborhoods with short commutes are holding up better than others. And in many parts of Texas and North Carolina, home prices have continued to rise slowly, have leveled off or have declined only modestly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a national basis, home prices peaked in mid-2006 after rising 86% since January 2000, according to the First American index. Since peaking, that index has fallen 13%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The declines have made homes more affordable, bringing prices in many areas closer to their long-term relationship to incomes. In the second quarter, the median home price of about $203,000 was 1.9 times average pretax household income, according to Economy.com. That was close to 1.87 times income for 1985 through 2000, prior to the housing boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing markets don't tend to turn around quickly. The price slump in California in the early 1990s, for instance, was a long grind. According to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home-price indexes, Los Angeles prices peaked in June 1990 and didn't bottom until March 1996. They didn't get back to their 1990 peak until 2000.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hypo Borrowers Exhale</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among those breathing a hearty sigh of relief this week after the German government bailed out lender Hypo Real Estate Group were developers Related Cos. and Metropole Realty Advisors Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hypo, based in Munich, committed last year to provide $520 million in financing for the $1 billion first phase of a massive ski village that Related is redeveloping in Snowmass Village, Colo. Construction of the condominiums and restaurants in that first phase is in progress, with blocks of condos being delivered to buyers throughout this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Related, led by New York real-estate tycoon Stephen Ross, declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Metropole, led by Chief Executive Officer Robert Siegel, in August landed a $130 million loan from Hypo to finance a renovation of an office building at 681 Fifth Ave. in New York. Neither Mr. Siegel nor representatives of Hypo returned messages seeking comment.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying Busted Abodes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For months, bargain hunters have been circling residential land. Now more investors are looking to buy distressed houses in bulk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A joint venture between investment firm LandCap Partners and auctioneer Kennedy Wilson has raised $100 million to buy homes, including partially built houses, from banks that have foreclosed on builders. The venture plans to complete the houses or condos and then auction them off to individual home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are all these builders going under and all these houses sitting out there," says Jeff Gault, chief executive of Los Angeles-based LandCap. "No one knows what to do with them."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LandCap started out targeting troubled land from banks but is expanding its focus. In August, a venture headed by LandCap bought $40 million of construction and land loans collateralized by 2,900 house lots from <span class="companylink">Wachovia Corp</span>. "Now I am starting to see a lot of incomplete buildings," says Mr. Gault. "I said, 'heck, we'll buy them and build them out.'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the current credit and housing market turmoil, Mr. Gault says he's confident that he can find buyers for the houses if the prices are low enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Michael Corkery</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nobody's Home</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conventional wisdom in the apartment-investing world has been that what's bad for the single-family housing market is good for apartments. After all, reluctant home buyers and folks fleeing from foreclosed homes need a place to stay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can throw that idea out the kitchen window. The latest figures from <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>. show that the apartment-vacancy rate nationwide in the third quarter ticked up for the third straight quarter, to 6.1%. What's worse, the middle two quarters of the year are traditionally the best for apartments, as families and students move in preparation for the school year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend is happening as homeownership has fallen to a seasonally adjusted rate of 68.1% from its peak in 2004 of 69.3%, according to the Census Bureau. (It rose a tiny 0.1 percentage point in the second quarter, the latest figures available.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's the rub? The economy, of course. Apartment fundamentals are tied closely to job growth. No jobs means families double-up with relatives, and kids ready to move out on their own stay put.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">California Officials Try to Avoid Second Housing Hit</span>
</div><div class="author">By Rhonda L. Rundle </div><div>1002 words</div><div>7 October 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Real Estate; A8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2008 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parts of Southern California hit hard by the housing crisis are maneuvering to shape the Treasury Department's plan to buy up troubled assets so that it doesn't wind up causing a second wave of pain in their communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials in San Bernardino and Riverside counties are determined to avoid a repeat of what happened 20 years ago, when the savings-and-loan crisis led to a massive selloff of distressed real estate in the area by the federal government's <span class="companylink">Resolution Trust Corp</span>. Many of those properties, including foreclosed homes, were sold at fire-sale prices to investors who unloaded them quickly. In some cases, entire neighborhoods of what had once been homeowners turned into largely rental communities, further depressing property values and delaying an economic rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We don't want the cure to be worse than the disease," said Steve PonTell, a business owner in the vast area east of Los Angeles known as the Inland Empire. He said he is worried that neighborhoods could be seriously damaged if the Treasury "dumps" real-estate assets in such a way that leads to absentee ownership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government representatives in the area are now scrambling to muster support for a federal bill that would allow local businesses and governments to buy up some of the real estate to make sure it doesn't fall into the hands of speculators who have no stake in the community. The bill, introduced Sept. 27 by Rep. Gary Miller, a Republican who represents some of the areas in Southern California hurting from the mortgage meltdown, promotes the formation of regional public-private partnerships that could buy homes in their geographic area from the Treasury. This approach, they argue, would help stabilize neighborhoods and maximize financial returns to taxpayers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the wake of the 1990s savings-and-loan crisis, said Patrick Morris, mayor of San Bernardino, "Our city was so severely impacted by the drama that we moved from a city of owner-occupied homes to a city of renters."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The concern in parts of Southern California illustrates the risks that could lie ahead for other communities as the Treasury begins a massive churn of assets. Depressed real-estate values in areas across the country could slide further if homes are sold to large financial investors who then flip them to others who want to make a quick profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller said he tried unsuccessfully to get his bill incorporated into last week's federal rescue package. He said he has spoken to other members of Congress who support the bill and that there is still time to debate the measure when Congress reconvenes in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The U.S. government is now in the real-estate business," he said in an interview. In order to make a smart investment, the Treasury should try to ensure that the real estate gets sold back into the local communities, he said. "We need to look at this as a business deal for the American people."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many parts of the Inland Empire, memories of the problems that erupted two decades ago are still fresh. In Moreno Valley, one of the communities where the RTC bought up numerous properties in the early 1990s, Jeff Burum, who at the time was a financial consultant to some large Wall Street investors, recalls that many homes that were taken back and sold or held by the RTC weren't properly managed and were allowed to deteriorate. Kids would break in and have parties on Friday nights. When windows broke, they weren't repaired. When neighbors tried to get them replaced, their phone calls wouldn't be returned, or they would be told by a local listing broker that "we don't manage the assets," said Mr. Burum, now chairman of Diversified Pacific, a Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., home builder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result was that property values in Moreno Valley fell below their already depressed values. Homes that sold for $120,000 to $150,000 fell to $100,000 during the downturn, but declined to $75,000 after too many homes were dumped onto the market at one time, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stan Ross, chairman of the University of Southern California's Lusk Center for Real Estate, said places like Moreno Valley already were suffering from substantially reduced values when the RTC took control. "It's so easy to blame the government in these situations," he cautioned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Counties such as Riverside and San Bernardino are already trying to gear up for what is expected to be a massive real-estate sale once the Treasury program gains steam. Last week, they passed resolutions supporting the formation of the "Regional Asset Value Recovery Corporation," an Inland Empire partnership to "preserve and restore neighborhoods and communities."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the initiative has backing from about 30 business owners and 15 cities in the two counties, all of them with the potential to become investors in the partnerships, said Lance Larson, legislative director for San Bernardino County. The partnerships could seek additional support from other investors and from California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mr. Miller said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other regions that are suffering high levels of foreclosures, especially in Florida, are expected to explore forming their own partnerships.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller's hastily written bill, H.R. 7189, is vague about how the proposed public-private partnerships would work. It would allow the Treasury to retain a stake in any of the properties that the partnerships acquire. Mr. Miller argues that the local partnerships would have better odds of ensuring that the assets rise in value, thus allowing the Treasury to retain a stake and "greatly improve the likelihood that the federal government makes a profit."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the biggest challenges, however, will be the unbundling of assets intertwined with various kinds of complex securities. In order to attract regional buyers, the Treasury would first have to group different assets by geography.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A successful plan to stabilize the U.S. economy and prevent a deep global recession must do more than buy back impaired debt from financial institutions. It must address the fundamental cause of the crisis: the downward spiral of house prices that devastates household wealth and destroys the capital of financial institutions that hold mortgages and mortgage-backed securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recently enacted financial rescue plan does nothing to stop this spiral. Credit will not flow and liquidity will not return to the banking system until financial institutions have confidence in the solvency and liquidity of other banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of the 20% fall in the price of homes since the bursting of the house-price bubble, there are now some 10 million homes with mortgages that exceed the value of the house. Residential mortgages are generally "no recourse" loans, meaning that if the homeowner stops making payments, the creditor can take the property but cannot take other assets or attach income. Individuals with loan-to-value ratios greater than 100% therefore have an incentive to default even if they can afford their monthly payments, and to rent an apartment or other house until house prices stop declining. When individuals default and creditors foreclose, the property is added to the stock of unsold homes. That depresses prices further, increasing the number and magnitude of negative equity houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prospect of a downward spiral of house prices depresses the value of mortgage-backed securities and therefore the capital and liquidity of financial institutions. Experts say that an additional 10% to 15% decline in house prices is needed to get back to the prebubble level. That decline would double the number of homes with negative equity, raising the total to 40% of all homes with mortgages. The mortgages of five million homeowners would then exceed the value of their homes by 30% or more, which could prompt millions of defaults.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The process of default and foreclosure leading to price declines and further defaults could take house prices far below the long-term sustainable level. But even when prices seem low, prospective buyers will delay buying as long as they expect prices will continue to fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The financial rescue plan would bring back the confidence needed to revive the financial system only if the Treasury's asset purchases could eliminate the current impaired securities now held by the financial institutions, and if the remaining securities could be counted on to remain healthy. The legislation will do neither.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than $700 billion is needed to buy all of the impaired securities. The impaired mortgage-backed securities reflect not only the negative-equity mortgages but also positive-equity mortgages with very high interest rates, adjustable rates, or negative amortization. Even if the government could purchase every troubled mortgage, the prospect of future price declines would contaminate the mortgage portfolios. As house prices fall, the value of mortgage-backed securities would fall further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The impaired assets are not just mortgages but the complex derivatives based on those mortgages: the collateralized debt obligations, the various risk slices of those CDOs that, even if rated AAA, often have market prices close to 50% of their notional value. In addition, hundreds of billions of dollars of credit default swaps "guarantee" the value of mortgage-backed securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are also important technical problems in using the $700 billion fund to buy impaired securities. The Treasury's preliminary idea was to use a "reverse auction," a method that works well when used to buy a single homogeneous security (like a firm buying back its own shares). But that is not feasible for buying the impaired securities, because of the enormous variety of underlying mortgages and of the almost limitless number of different derivatives based on those mortgages. The buyback will therefore involve a large number of arbitrary valuation decisions by the Treasury staff and their investment-banker advisers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of the arbitrary pricing, many banks will choose not to sell some of their assets. Mark-to-market rules may force banks to write down the value of their remaining securities, further reducing their capital and subjecting them to margin calls that reduce their liquidity. Institutions that avoid marking their assets to market will simply cause a cloud of uncertainty about the value of their portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The features that Congress added to the initial Treasury plan do nothing to achieve sustained confidence in the financial institutions. They provide Congressional oversight, delay the use of funds, create partial government equity ownership in some firms and do other things to protect taxpayers. But they do not address falling home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We need a firewall to break the downward spiral of house prices. Here's how it might work. The federal government would offer any homeowner with a mortgage an opportunity to replace 20% of the mortgage with a low-interest loan from the government, subject to a maximum of $80,000. This would be available to new buyers as well as those with mortgages. The interest on that loan would reflect the government's cost of funds and could be as low as 2%. The loan would not be secured by the house but would be a loan with full recourse, allowing the government to take other property or income in the unlikely event that the individual does not pay. It would by law be senior to other unsecured debt and not eligible for relief in bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The individual could repay the loan at any time or could refinance the remaining loan on more favorable terms as long as the principal did not increase. A 30-year amortization of the government loan would make the payments low, and a life-insurance policy would protect taxpayers if the borrower dies before the loan is repaid. If the homeowner chooses to accept the loan, creditors would have to accept the 20% mortgage repayment, reducing the monthly payments of principal and interest by 20%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider a homeowner who has a mortgage equal to 90% of the value of his home. The 15% decline in the value of his house that may be needed to bring it back to its prebubble level would shift that homeowner into negative equity. Further price declines would make default attractive. But the 20% mortgage replacement loan would take the loan-to-value ratio to 72% from 90%, making it unlikely that prices would fall far enough to push him into negative equity. An interest saving that could be as large as $3,000 a year would provide a strong incentive to accept the mortgage-replacement loan, even if the individual thinks that he might temporarily have a moderate level of negative equity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the total size of the mortgage-loan program might be as much as $1 trillion, this would not be comparable to other government spending or to a swap of government bonds for impaired assets. The government would instead have a fully offsetting claim on individuals who could be counted on to repay their low-interest government loans. The cash that the banks and other creditors would receive from the government to replace the existing mortgages would be available to finance new loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage-replacement loans cannot solve all the problems of the housing sector. Unlike the recent Frank-Dodd legislation, it does not provide help to those who now face foreclosure. Homeowners without mortgages would benefit only indirectly from the program because it would stop the decline in the value of their homes. But everyone would benefit from the overall economic effect of reviving the financial sector and the credit flows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent financial recovery plan that Congress enacted will not rebuild lending and credit flows. That requires a program to stop a downward overshooting of house prices and the resulting mortgage defaults. The mortgage-replacement loan program may be the best way to achieve that.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers Holdings</span>' former chief financial officer, Erin Callan, is in contract to sell her two-bedroom condominium in New York's 15 Central Park West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale is set to close this week for $11.8 million, just below the $12 million asking price, a person familiar with the deal said. That would be nearly double the $6.48 million Ms. Callan agreed to pay for the condo about three years ago while the building was under construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lehman demoted Ms. Callan, who is considered one of the most powerful women on Wall Street, from her CFO post in June, as part of a shakeup in the company's unsuccessful bid to restore investor confidence. In July, Ms. Callan joined <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse Group</span> and now oversees its global hedge-fund business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many early buyers at 15 CPW have sold their apartments at a significant profit. Ms. Callan's 31st-floor apartment of about 2,400 square feet has two bathrooms and a powder room. Neighbors at the Robert A.M. Stern-designed limestone building include Sanford Weill (who paid $42.4 million for his apartment) and hedge-fund manager Daniel Loeb ($45 million).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, shortly after closing her purchase in the newly finished building, Ms. Callan put the unit back on the market for $14 million, then dropped the price to $12 million. Listing agents were Sherry Matays and Julianne Bond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contractor Buys in L.A. For $36.7 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the biggest single-family home sale so far this year in Los Angeles, Ronald Tutor, chairman and chief executive of building contractor <span class="companylink">Perini Corp</span>., paid $36.7 million for a massive, not-yet-completed house in the Beverly Park gated community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 27,000-square-foot Tuscan-style stucco home will have nine bedrooms, 18 bathrooms, a movie theater and a gym. The 3.55 acres include a pool, a tennis court and a guest house. Mauricio Umansky, of Hilton &amp;Hyland, had the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tutor was the longtime chief of Tutor-Saliba, a closely held general contractor that's merged with Perini and whose projects include the <span class="companylink">Bay Area Rapid Transit</span>-San Francisco International Airport extension. The seller was Lee Kort, an operating partner in California-based mobile-home-community operator Kort &amp;Scott Financial Services, who paid $10.5 million for the vacant lot in 2005 and listed the house this spring for $49 million. Tracy Maltas, of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>, represented Mr. Tutor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beverly Park neighbors include Viacom Chairman Sumner Redstone and Denzel Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Listing by Widow of Condé Nast's Florio</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The widow of Steven T. Florio, the former CEO of <span class="companylink">Condé Nast Publications</span>, has listed their waterfront Key Largo, Fla., vacation home for $8.9 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Florio presided over 16 magazines including Vogue, Architectural Digest and the New Yorker, until 2004, before he stepped down. He died in December 2007 at the age of 58.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 9,000-square-foot, six-bedroom Mediterranean house -- in Ocean Reef, a private club and community of about 4,000 acres -- has eight full bathrooms, a billiard room, an elevator and a four-car garage. The property includes a pool and a dock with room for a 70-foot boat. Mr. Florio and his wife, Mariann, paid $4.8 million for the property in 2001. Russell Post, of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>, has the listing.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans are in a vicious cycle: falling housing values cause losses on securities, which reduce bank capital, thereby tightening lending and causing house prices to fall further. The cycle has spread beyond housing, but housing is the place to fix it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts are at their lowest level since the early 1980s, while there are more vacant houses than at any time since the Census Bureau started keeping such data in 1960. Millions of homeowners owe more on their mortgage than their house is worth. Foreclosures are accelerating. House prices continue to fall, weakening household balance sheets and the balance sheets of financial institutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this can stop. The price of a home is partially dependent on the mortgage rate -- a lower mortgage rate raises house prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We propose that the Bush administration and Congress allow all residential mortgages on primary residences to be refinanced into 30-year fixed-rate mortgages at 5.25% (matching the lowest mortgage rate in the past 30 years), and place those mortgages with <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. Investors and speculators should not be allowed to qualify.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The historical spread of the 30-year, fixed-rate conforming mortgage over 10-year Treasury bonds is about 160 basis points. So a rate of 5.25% would be close to where mortgage rates would be today with normally functioning mortgage markets. One of us (Chris Mayer) recently published a study showing that -- assuming normally functioning mortgage markets -- the cost of buying a house is now 10% to 15% below the cost of renting across most of the country. Rising mortgage spreads and down-payment requirements are what's still driving down housing prices. We need to stop this decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The direct cost of this plan would be modest for the 85% of mortgages where the homeowner owes less on the house than it is worth. Lower interest rates will mean higher overall house prices. The government now controls nearly 90% of the mortgage market and can (and should) act on this realization. Remove the refinancing option and you can have lower rates without substantial cost to the taxpayer. Homeowners would have to give up the right to refinance their mortgage if rates fall, although homeowners could pay off their mortgage by selling their home. For borrowers with lower credit scores, the mortgage rate would be greater than 5.25%, but it would be less than their current rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, what about mortgages on homes that are worth less than the total amount of the loan? These mortgages could be refinanced into a 30-year fixed-rate loan to be held by a new agency modeled on the 1930s-era Homeowners Loan Corporation. New mortgages would be made of up 95% of the current value of a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government might use two approaches to mitigate its losses. It could offer owners and servicers the opportunity to split the losses on refinancing a mortgage with the new agency. Servicers would have to agree to accept these refinancings on all or none of their mortgages, to avoid cherry-picking. Or the government should take an equity position in return for the mortgage write-down so that the taxpayers profit when the housing market turns around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our calculations based on deeds and Census data suggest that the total amount of negative equity for all owner-occupied houses is $593 billion. However, capping an individual's write-down to $75,000 would reduce the government's total liability to $338 billion and cover 68% of individuals with negative equity. Even this loss will be reduced as the proposal spelled out here raises housing values and economic activity, and contemplates loss sharing with lenders, hopefully matching the experience of the old Homeowners Loan Corporation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the net cost is modest compared with many plans on the table, it would require that the government could assume trillions of dollars of additional mortgages on its balance sheet. But we have already crossed this bridge with the explicit "conservatorship" of <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. In any event, these mortgages would be backed by houses and the verified ability to repay the debt by millions of Americans. In addition, by putting a floor under house prices, this proposal would raise the value to taxpayers of trillions of existing home mortgage assets already owned or guaranteed by the FDIC, the Fed, the Treasury, <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, among others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Improvements in household and financial institution balance sheets will increase investment and consumer spending, which will mitigate the extent of the current downturn. Americans, on average, spend about 5% of the equity of their homes on consumer goods and services. So if home prices increased 10% above where they would have been without government intervention, we estimate consumers will have an additional $100 billion annually to spend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to focusing on the very real problem in the housing market, the plan could be implemented immediately. As a result of the U.S. government's conservatorship of <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, origination of new mortgages can be financed quickly. Congress would have to raise the overall borrowing limit and approve the new federal purchases of negative equity loans. But it will likely take the Treasury much longer to buy troubled assets than Fannie and Freddie, and it would have to seek the involvement of many additional private actors, as opposed to using vehicles already in place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline in housing prices remains the elephant in the room in the discussion of the credit market deterioration. Let's start there.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the downturn deepens, many would-be homeowners are taking advantage of down payment and closing cost assistance, free finished basements and other incentives offered by builders eager to move their merchandise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But buyers should take care that they're not purchasing an inferior-quality house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the month of August, the producer price index for construction materials rose 13% over the same period a year earlier, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. As costs rise, some builders cut corners. The Consumer Federation of America says construction tops its list of the five fastest-growing complaint categories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bruce Barker, a Phoenix home inspector, says almost all the new houses he sees have minimum-quality windows, and about three-quarters have inadequate loose fill or fiberglass insulation; other houses he's inspected have brand-name condensers on the exterior of the home, where buyers can see them, connected to generic furnaces hidden in the attic. Steve Showalter, a Graysonville, Md. inspector, says builders have stopped using plywood sheathing and instead use oriented strand board, which can swell with moisture unless it's installed correctly—and it rarely is, he says. Rob Ringen, a Sonora, Calif. home inspector, estimates that 80% of the repair work that new home owners have to do today can be traced directly to poor-quality materials like twisted and split framing, and short-cuts on installation, like missing flashing over windows that allows rain to leak in. And since building code inspectors are being laid off in the downturn, and remaining ones overworked, such problems often slip by. "Homeowners get it right in the neck," says Mr. Ringen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since new home contracts often have binding arbitration clauses, many disgruntled buyers can't sue—although some have taken creative steps to embarrass builders they think have cheated them. Cynthia and John Daugherty posed as orange-jumpsuited "prisoners" on the Web site they made about their Pulte-built Kansas home [http://camplemonadestand.com/defects.htm], listing complaints about bad foundation walls and bouncy floors. Crapconstruction.com, with a logo of a home swirling down the toilet, was created for Beazer Home buyers complaining about buckling hardwood floors, chipped tiles and cracked caulk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although builders have been known to sue or buy out people who start complaint sites, it's far less stressful to prevent such problems in the first place. While visiting the house often during the construction period can uncover some problems, most homeowners don't have the expertise to check for every defect in construction and materials. That's why it's essential to turn to professionals to look after your interests. Before you sign a contract, have your attorney read it to make sure your rights to legal redress for defects are protected. Before you close, make sure to hire a home inspector, preferably one with an engineering background, to ensure that no one took any shortcuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, take time to read and understand whatever warranties the builder offers. The warranty will likely exclude certain items like appliances and cracks from normal settling of the house, and may limit the amount of time you have to file a claim for damages or defects. This time period may be shorter than the time state law provides for filing a lawsuit under the principle of "implied warranty," so the builder may demand that you sign a paper waiving these rights. This is in the builder's interest, but not yours. Don't do it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices declined in July, reflecting a housing market infected by a lack of confidence now battering financial markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices fell an average 0.9% in July compared with June in the 20 U.S. metropolitan areas tracked by the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home-price index. The July drop was larger than expected and ended four months of slowing price declines that analysts had hoped signaled some stabilization in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">July's price declines pushed the 20-city index down by 16% from the previous year. A 10-city index fell by 18% year over year, the most in the series' 21-year history. During the housing downturn in the early 1990s, the 10-city index's largest yearly decline was 6.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, a gauge of consumer confidence improved slightly in September, after declining in June and July amid record oil and gas prices. The Conference Board, a New York research group, said its index rose to 59.8 in September from 58.5 in August, although the latest survey period didn't fully encompass the current turmoil in financial markets and Congress's rejection of the bailout legislation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The financial system's uncertainty is likely to hinder a housing-market recovery. While mortgage rates are lower than they were in July, buyers face tighter lending restrictions and often must make bigger down payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The larger house price decline in July . . . may be the beginning of a renewed acceleration in the depreciation of U.S. house prices," said Harm Bandholz, an economist with <span class="companylink">UniCredit</span> Group in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sunbelt cities with a large proportion of foreclosures and subprime loans continued to post significant yearly declines. Home prices in Las Vegas were down 30% in July from a year ago; in Phoenix, prices dropped 29% and in Miami, 28%. In California, prices in Los Angeles tumbled by 26%, while prices in San Diego and San Francisco dropped about 25%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The nominal price of single-family homes is now back to levels of June 2004," said Charles McMillion, chief economist at MBG Information Services in Washington.

</div><div class="author">By Deborah Lynn Blumberg and Jeff Bater </div><div>629 words</div><div>1 October 2008</div><div>11:07</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Economy</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2008 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Factory activity failed to grow in September, with the overall index reaching the lowest level since October 2001.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, U.S. construction spending performed better than expected during August as residential outlays made a rare increase and offset a dip in commercial building, but the prior month's drop was revised far down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management said that its index of manufacturing activity came in at 43.5 in September compared with 49.9 in August and 50.0 in July. It had been expected to stand at 49.5. Readings below 50 indicate contracting economic activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index "indicates a significantly faster rate of decline in manufacturing during September, marking a departure from the 2008 trend toward negligible growth or contraction each month," said Norbert Ore, who directs the survey for the ISM.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The month's report also showed prices rose at a much slower rate, with that index falling to the lowest level in 21 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the report, the private research group said that the price index dropped to 53.5 in September versus 77.0 in August and 88.5 in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the September new orders index hit 38.8, down from 48.3 in August, while the production index was at 40.8, down from 52.1 in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hiring slipped, with the employment index at 41.8 in September compared with 49.7 in August and 51.9 in July. Inventories contracted, with that reading at 43.4 versus August's 49.3.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flat Construction</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total construction spending remained flat, totaling a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.072 trillion, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">July spending was revised down sharply. It plunged by 1.4%; originally, the government said spending that month fell 0.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lack of change in August outlays was better than projected. Wall Street had expected construction spending for the month would decline by 0.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential construction spending increased 0.3% to $351.7 billion following a long string of declines. Residential spending dived by 3.7% in July; it was originally seen 2.1% lower for the month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Year over year, residential was 27.9% lower in August. Builders aren't building that much because houses aren't selling well and inventory is way up. Bloated supply of unsold homes depresses prices. Falling prices curb sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And fewer new homes suggest fewer new neighborhoods, restraining commercial construction. Non-residential construction spending decreased in August, dipping 0.1%. Spending fell in most sub-categories, including commercial, churches, public safety, recreation, and communication facilities; spending rose, though, for some projects, including roads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tight credit conditions are hampering commercial construction. The latest Federal Reserve senior loan officer survey showed about 80% of domestic banks reported having tightened their lending standards on commercial real estate loans in the second quarter of 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Furthermore, the weak economy is pushing vacancy rates higher. And billings at U.S. architectural firms are declining.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private-sector construction spending dropped in August by 0.3% to $759.6 billion. Spending plunged 2.4% in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Public, or government, construction climbed. But analysts see problems ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tax revenues are slowing because of the economy's softness. Corporate profits are shrinking and investors have lost money in the stock market. Falling tax receipts pressure governments' construction budgets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Public construction spending increased 0.8% in August to $312.5 billion. Federal government construction outlays rose 1.1%. State and local spending increased 0.8% to $288.5 billion. Overall July public construction outlays increased 1.3%.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Alex Frangos </div><div>1146 words</div><div>1 October 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Commercial Real Estate; C1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2008 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a young associate at <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> in the early 1990s, Mark Walsh made his name snapping up distressed debt from the government at huge discounts following the collapse of the commercial-property market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today he stands over the wreckage of another real-estate collapse, but this time it is his own. As the head of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc</span>.'s vast commercial-real-estate operations, Mr. Walsh left the firm holding more than $32.6 billion of loans and assets, some of them acquired as the real-estate market peaked in 2006 and 2007. That commercial-real-estate exposure was among the culprits in Lehman's collapse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lehman has been forced to mark down investments that were made under Mr. Walsh's watch by $3.6 billion this year. In addition, it has sold about $7 billion of commercial mortgages and mortgage securities this year, some at losses of up to 20%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, many who invested during the commercial-real-estate boom got hurt. Mr. Walsh's defenders point out that for years his real-estate group reaped huge profits and no one could have predicted how quickly the market reversed direction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He made a lot of money for a lot of people, including people at Lehman," says David Levinson, chief executive of L&amp;L Holding Co., a developer that did several deals with Mr. Walsh. "It was just one of these things that when the unexpected happened, he was on the firing line."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Walsh kept doing deals even as rivals stepped back amid signs that credit was tightening and the market had peaked. Mr. Walsh's biggest deal, the $22 billion Lehman-led buyout of apartment building owner <span class="companylink">Archstone-Smith Trust</span>, didn't close until October 2007. Mr. Walsh pushed the deal through even as some analysts speculated that Lehman would scuttle the deal and eat the $1.5 billion breakup fee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Walsh, 48 years old, has stayed out of the limelight. Known for being analytical and aggressive, he amassed enormous power over Lehman's commercial real estate over the years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that Lehman's U.S. operations have been acquired by <span class="companylink">Barclays PLC</span>, Mr. Walsh is likely to leave, according to people familiar with the matter. A top real-estate executive at <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>, Michael Mazzei, who is a former colleague of Mr. Walsh's at Lehman, is likely to have a leadership role at the combined operations. Mr. Mazzei declined comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Lehman's financial records and people familiar with its business, Mr. Walsh pushed Lehman into riskier loans and investments, sometimes combining Lehman's exposure in single deals across various pieces of senior secured debt, mezzanine financing and straight equity investments. He was among the earliest and most aggressive lenders of so-called bridge equity, short-term loans of equity that helped deals close quickly, with the expectation that Lehman would replace its loan with new equity partners after the deal closed and collect a fee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When property values were rising, the variety of investments greatly increased Lehman's return. But it also exposed the firm to greater risk, which proved to be disastrous when the market turned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was in the final years that Mr. Walsh went too far, some critics say. Lehman made big bets on residential land speculators such as SunCal Cos. in California. He also continued making loans and investments even as the market turned in 2007. Lehman got the Archstone deal done, thanks in large part to a $9 billion financing Mr. Walsh arranged from <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. But Lehman was left with more than $2 billion of bridge equity on its books that it was unable to sell. (<span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> also took major stakes in the Archstone deal.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 2008, Lehman was under pressure and Mr. Walsh was forced to sell significant holdings. It wrote down other investments, such as Archstone. Critics say it didn't write down those investments enough. Supporters inside Lehman say Mr. Walsh was caught by a bad market and that most of Lehman's real-estate pain was in residential mortgages, an area he didn't control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the final days of Lehman, Mr. Walsh worked hard to package Lehman's commercial real-estate into a spunoff entity. Investors didn't bite. His reckoning came the weekend of Lehman's collapse at the Federal Reserve Bank in New York. During the tense meetings with Wall Street's titans, Mr. Walsh fielded hostile questions from other firms' executives about Lehman's commercial-real-estate portfolio, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Walsh grew up in Yonkers, N.Y., north of New York City. After attending Fordham Law School he became a real-estate attorney. He joined Lehman in 1988. He took advantage of the real-estate carnage at the time, buying bad loans at auction from the <span class="companylink">Resolution Trust Corp</span>. and packaged them into securities backed by commercial mortgages, among other strategies, according to colleagues. By 1995, he was a managing director, working alongside Mr. Mazzei.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the real-estate markets improved, Mr. Walsh led Lehman into originating new loans for real-estate developers, a business Lehman had never been in. The boom in the formation of real-estate investment trusts also led to major profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Mark is one of the most brilliant, creative real estate engineers in modern history," says Richard Ziman, chairman of AVP Advisors, Inc., a real estate investment firm who has done $400 million of business with Mr. Walsh. Mr. Ziman recalls a purchase he made in the 1990s that Mr. Walsh financed. It was seven properties Mr. Ziman bought from seven different owners and Mr. Walsh arranged to close it all on a single day. "He understands the entire orbit of real estate," Mr. Ziman says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Walsh and colleague, Raymond Mikulich, also spearheaded Lehman's real estate private-equity fund business. Lehman eventually raised three equity funds and two mezzanine debt funds that raised over $7 billion of capital from investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors in Mr. Walsh's funds expressed surprise at the turn of events. "I always find [Mr. Walsh's team] to be very good risk mitigators," says Alice Connell, the former head of real estate at pension titan <span class="companylink">TIAA-Cref</span>. She invested in two of Lehman's funds before she left in 2006. Mr. Walsh's team would "forgo the last few inches of potential profit to mitigate downside risk," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the days since Lehman's bankruptcy filing and the Barclay's takeover, colleagues say Mr. Walsh has showed up for work, making phone calls to help place his employees at new firms.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kelly Evans </div><div>496 words</div><div>26 September 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even before the latest blows to the U.S. financial system, sales of new homes and orders for big-ticket items were slowing sharply, underscoring the precarious nature of the nation's economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The troubling data provide "fresh evidence the economy is in recession," said Bernard Baumohl, managing director of Economic Outlook Group in Princeton, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes dropped by a seasonally adjusted 11.5% in August from the month before, the Commerce Department said Thursday, and the backlog of unsold homes rose to a bloated 10.9-months' supply at the current sales pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales are often volatile month to month, and have been hit hard by overbuilding in past years. That has led to a glut of unsold homes. Sales of existing homes, by comparison, which make up 85% of the overall market, slowed last month to a lesser degree.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data show that the housing market was weakening even before the latest flare-up in credit markets -- which will likely depress activity further as potential buyers face more difficulty getting loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Given the freezing up of the credit market, we do anticipate that the September and October data will be frightening," said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at Merk Investments in Palo Alto, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, a sharp decline in orders for big-ticket items last month shows a slowdown in business and consumer spending -- two key drivers of economic growth -- is already under way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New orders for durable goods -- items like cars, furniture and appliances intended to last three years or more -- fell 4.5% in August to $208.5 billion after posting gains in the three prior months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop in orders suggests buying activity from retailers and consumers is already slowing. And the manufacturing sector's ability to rely on strong foreign demand and export growth to offset the slowing U.S. economy may be short-lived as the U.K., the euro zone and Japan all join the U.S. in flirting with recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, labor-market conditions continue to deteriorate. New unemployment claims rose to a seasonally adjusted level of 493,000 last week, the Labor Department said, from a revised 461,000 the week before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise was a result of new claims in regions affected by Hurricanes Gustav and Ike, the government said, but the underlying pace of unemployment claims remains at levels seen during past recessions. The four-week average rose by 16,000 to 462,500. The total number of new and continuing claims for the week ended Sept. 13 rose to 3.5 million, around one million more than was seen at this time last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Job losses are expected to intensify in the next several months as the shakeout from layoffs in finance and related industries spreads, and businesses remain under pressure.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sara Lin </div><div>1084 words</div><div>26 September 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>W8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York -- For months, as housing values were falling for midsize ranch houses in Stockton, Calif., and Las Vegas high-rises, sales of high-end properties in financial centers like London, New York and San Francisco continued to percolate along.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that was before last week, when turmoil in the credit markets brought down <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers Holdings</span> and imperiled thousands of high-paying jobs. While those rare properties priced at $20 million or more are still holding up, there are signs that the crisis is exacerbating a downturn that was already plaguing properties in the $2 million to $10 million range, a market often sought by Wall Street workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since last Thursday, there have been 200 price cuts on properties listed at less than $10 million on Manhattan's Upper East Side or Upper West Side -- a 17% jump from the week before. Deanna Kory, a broker with New York-based <span class="companylink">Corcoran Group</span> who's handling nearly two-dozen properties priced between $2 million and $10 million, says her showings are down by about 40% in the last two weeks compared to the same time last year. A slew of new buildings set to open in the next year will only increase supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The impact is reaching beyond Manhattan. On Massachusetts's North Shore, where the average sale price of luxury homes is about $3 million, Lanse L. Robb says he's lost more than $15 million in listings and transactions in the last week. First, prospective buyers for a $4 million waterfront home canceled their showing. Then two clients spooked by the financial meltdown held off listing their houses or looking for new ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One buyer who was poised to put an offer on a $15.7 million. 10-acre oceanfront estate in Manchester-by-the-Sea suddenly stopped returning Mr. Robb's calls. "I still haven't heard back," says Mr. Robb, of Christie's Great Estates affiliate LandVest. "It's total silence."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In San Francisco, a buyer in the market for an $8 million to $10 million property told Mark Allan Levinson last week to hold off on the search because his stock portfolio had just taken a big hit. "People are still buying, but they're not quite as bullish," says Mr. Levinson, of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span> in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last Wednesday, a New York City buyer haggling over the purchase of a $1.9 million apartment used last week's turbulence to win an additional $100,000 discount. Arguing the situation had dramatically changed, the buyer contended that the market was headed for a steep decline. "He had lowballed the price to start with," says Anne Snee, a broker at Corcoran. "But given what's going on, I'm not sure that [the sellers] didn't make the right decision."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the strongest part of the high-end market are the few "trophy" properties -- penthouses and other apartments with one-of-a-kind features that rarely come up for sale. "There are always people with money. Somebody's always on the other side of these crises," says David Ogilvy, a broker in Greenwich, Conn., who this year sold a $30 million house -- the second-most-expensive house ever sold in the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York on Tuesday, 50 people perused a 5,500-square-foot duplex penthouse on an in-demand Park Avenue block. Put on the market that very day, the 10-room cooperative apartment once owned by Broadway playwright and director Moss Hart and actress Kitty Carlisle boasts high ceilings, stunning city views and a $20 million pricetag.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Katherine Marshall, the broker whose family owns the unit, five prospective buyers have already returned to check out the apartment a second time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leighton Candler, a broker with Corcoran, says she has seen solid buyer interest in her top-shelf listings, which include a $46 million penthouse at 778 Park Ave. Previously owned by Manhattan socialite Brooke Astor, the apartment features 14 rooms, six terraces, five wood-burning fireplaces and city views.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Candler is also selling a $46.5 million penthouse at 1020 Fifth Ave., with a 40-foot grand salon and views of Central Park and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It has been owned by the same family since it was built in 1925.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just a few weeks ago, San Francisco saw one of its priciest listings ever, a 20,000-square-foot penthouse topping the St. Regis Residences. Encompassing two floors and featuring four terraces as well as a two-story waterfall, the still-unfinished unit has an asking price of $70 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, places like New York and San Francisco are still faring better than many other areas of the U.S., particularly areas of Southern California and Florida. "I think everyone is taking a hit," says Suzanne Perkins of Sotheby's in Santa Barbara, Calif., where prices have fallen 20% in the last year. "I still have buyers in the $20 million range, but they're looking for deals and they're looking for sellers who will negotiate."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the run-up to the real-estate boom, brokers sometimes slapped headline-grabbing asking prices on highly desirable homes just to drum up interest and create buzz. Now, many of the tricks brokers are using to sell properties at the high-end are the same ones used with their more modest counterparts. The first and foremost: persuading the seller to list the home at an attractive price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Miami, Nelson Gonzalez of Esslingler Wooten Maxwell Realtors says he recently had to tell a client who wants to put his house on the market for $25 million to $30 million that it's really worth about half that amount. "I'm not willing to just put it on the market at the seller's pricing. I'm putting things on the market that are priced so they will sell," says Mr. Gonzalez.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid the financial crisis, agents say many buyers are also more reluctant to buy splashy properties for reasons other than the cost. "I don't think anybody is going to be bidding for at least the next several weeks," says Kirk Henckels of Stribling Private Brokerage. "You'd feel pretty silly walking into a cocktail party today and saying you bought an apartment today."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes declined in August, but in a promising sign the backlog of unsold homes shrank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes fell 2.2% in August from the previous month to an annual sales pace of 4.91 million units, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday. The data cover sales of homes, condominiums and townhouses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of unsold houses fell to a 10.4-month supply at the current sales pace, compared with July's 10.9-month supply. The current inventory is still large, and many analysts say prices must fall even more to attract buyers. The median home price was $203,100 in August, down 9.5% from the year before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We would not expect to see any real stability in the housing market until we work off more of this inventory," said <span class="companylink">Wachovia Corp</span>. economist Adam York in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales increased in parts of California, Florida and Nevada where subprime loans and foreclosures are heavily concentrated, the NAR said. Chief economist Lawrence Yun noted that sales of deeply discounted properties "are accounting for a disproportionately high level of sales in the current market" and helping to drive down the median sales price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Efforts to work through bloated inventories may be hampered by the financial crisis on Wall Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home sales will be constrained without a freer flow of credit into the mortgage market," Mr. Yun said. "The faster that happens, the sooner we'll see a broad stabilization in home prices that in turn will help the economy recover."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But lenders continued in the second quarter of 2008 to toughen standards on home loans, the Federal Reserve's latest quarterly survey of senior loan officers at U.S. banks showed. About 75% said they tightened standards on prime mortgages, and that tightening is expected to continue this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides tighter loan standards and falling prices, the housing market also has been hurt by a weakening job market. Nonfarm payrolls have declined for eight consecutive months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regionally, sales of existing homes declined 6.6% in the Northeast and 5.3% in the West. Sales rose 0.9% in the Midwest and 0.5% in the South.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A steep decline in new-home construction last month to a 17-year low suggests that the hoped-for stabilization of the housing market -- key to boosting the U.S. economy -- is still a ways off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of new homes dropped by 6.2% in August to a seasonally adjusted 895,000 annual rate, the Commerce Department said. Construction of multifamily units fell sharply. Single-family home construction fell by a smaller amount but remained at very low levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newly issued building permits also declined in August, suggesting that construction could continue to drop in coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists have been watching for signs that home construction, which has been a significant drag on U.S. economic growth, is beginning to stabilize. But the latest data, combined with gloomy sentiment among home builders and worsening problems in credit markets, suggest that conditions in the housing industry could worsen further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A credit crunch is materializing with significant force that completely invalidates the notion that the housing slump is 'bottoming,'" said Roger Kubarych, chief U.S. economist at <span class="companylink">UniCredit</span>, a markets and investment bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government also reported that the U.S. deficit on trade, income and other payments widened this spring as the price of imported oil surged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current-account deficit increased to $183.1 billion in the second quarter, compared with a revised $175.6 billion in the first quarter. Nearly half of the increase came from a rise in the cost of petroleum and related products. With oil prices falling in recent months, the deficit is expected to shrink.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strong export growth in the second quarter is also expected to slow. Exports of goods rose by $19.5 billion to $337.3 billion in the April-June quarter, helped by a weak dollar and strong foreign demand for U.S. goods. The trade balance provided a huge boost to U.S. growth in the second quarter, so slowing exports could hurt growth in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trade report also showed that foreigners bought $17.7 billion in U.S. corporate and agency bonds in the second quarter, compared with $28.7 billion in the first quarter.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Amy Hoak   </div><div>712 words</div><div>14 September 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Sunday</div><div>SNJR</div><div>3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government takeover of mortgage giants <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> has pushed mortgage rates lower, a boon for some home buyers and for homeowners seeking to refinance, but it is not automatically going to make home loans easier to obtain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the wake of the takeover, interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages dropped substantially, falling under 6% for the first time since May, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>'s weekly rate survey. The national average for the 30-year fixed-rate loan was 5.93% for the week ended Thursday, down from 6.35% the prior week and 6.31% a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, coming up with a bigger down payment has been a barrier for some first-time home buyers, while others have struggled with tighter underwriting that lenders have put in place in response to the weakened housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The credit-standards pendulum has been swinging to the conservative side, and it could swing toward the middle," says Dan Cutaia, president of Fairway Independent Mortgage, based in Sun Prairie, Wis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But any loosening of underwriting standards could be relatively small, and it's unlikely that no-down-payment or no-documentation mortgages -- staples of the housing boom earlier this decade -- will make a return in the near term, Mr. Cutaia says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After all, Uncle Sam had to step in and take control because of the problems created by having bad loans on the books and the agency now running the two mortgage giants certainly is not going to risk making more bad loans, says Greg McBride, senior financial analyst at Bankrate.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government's move helps to stabilize the shaky mortgage market and take out some of the unknowns, removing some of the fears of mortgage investors, says Bob Moulton, president of Manhasset, N.Y.-based Americana Mortgage Group. Without worries about Fannie and Freddie, more people were willing to invest in mortgage bonds, creating downward pressure on loan rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lower rates could hold for a while, some mortgage professionals say -- a welcome respite compared with the mid-6% range the 30-year mortgage hit at various times this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another area where the government bailout could help homeowners: So-called conforming jumbo mortgages could become more obtainable and affordable, says Gibran Nicholas, chief executive of the CMPS Institute, a training, certification and membership program for those who provide mortgage and real-estate equity advice. These are mortgages at the top of the conforming limit, as high as $729,000 in high-cost areas including California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent legislation created this new breed of mortgage when conforming loan limits -- the top mortgage amounts Fannie and Freddie were allowed to finance -- were raised in an effort to make bigger loans more affordable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A break on conforming mortgage rates could, in turn, help bring some stability to the housing market if buyers decide to take advantage of them, says Lawrence Yun, chief economist of the National Association of Realtors. "There is generally one quarter lag time between when rates fall and when home sales pick up," he says, adding that home sales might improve in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coupled with lower home prices and a temporary $7,500 tax credit for first-time home buyers, there could also be more activity from those who don't currently own a home, says Jim Sahnger, a mortgage planner with Palm Beach Financial Network.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rate drop could also spur somewhat of a "refi boomlet," in the next several months, Mr. Cutaia says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the people seeking to refinance are those with adjustable-rate loans that have already or will soon reset to higher rates, says Greg Willis, president of retail lending for Ace Mortgage Funding in Indianapolis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, people who are underwater on their loans -- owing more on their homes than they're currently worth -- probably aren't going to get any additional relief due to this recent Fannie and Freddie development, says Jared Bernstein, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are significant numbers of people out there who still have homes worth less than their mortgages and it doesn't change that game," Mr. Bernstein says.</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>399 words</div><div>11 September 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes listed for sale declined in many metropolitan markets last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of homes available for sale in 29 major metropolitan areas in August was down 2.6% from a month earlier, according to figures compiled by ZipRealty Inc., a real-estate brokerage firm based in Emeryville, Calif. The ZipRealty data cover all listings of single-family homes, condominiums and town houses on local multiple-listing services in metro areas where the firm operates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ivy Zelman, chief executive of Zelman &amp;Associates, a housing research firm, says inventory is falling largely because a large number of foreclosed homes are being sold at "distressed prices," which are dragging down prices for all types of homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a national basis, home inventories typically grow modestly in August from July. Over the past 25 years, the average increase during August has been 2.2%, according to Zelman &amp;Associates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the supply is no longer growing quickly, it remains abundant. One reason for the recent declines in many cities is that potential sellers have withdrawn from the market because they don't want to compete with builders and banks that have been slashing prices in an effort to clear out their inventories of new or foreclosed homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, 4.67 million previously occupied homes were listed for sale at the end of July, according to the National Association of Realtors. At the current sales rate, that's enough to last about 11 months, the trade group says. The housing market is considered roughly in balance between supply and demand when the inventory is enough to last around six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The August inventory was down about 8% from a year earlier in the 18 metro markets for which comparable year-earlier data are available, ZipRealty said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ZipRealty data don't include New York. But Miller Samuel Inc., an appraisal firm based there, says there were 6,094 cooperative apartments and condominiums available for sale in Manhattan at the end of August. That was down 5.3% from July but up 31% from August 2007. Losses of jobs on Wall Street are expected to weigh on the Manhattan market. Jonathan J. Miller, chief executive of Miller Samuel, sees the price trend as "flat to weakening."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kelly Evans </div><div>500 words</div><div>10 September 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. economy continues to be marked by weak housing and labor-market conditions, according to the latest data, suggesting economic performance will be sluggish at best through the end of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending home sales, which look at the number of contracts signed, dropped 3.2% in July, reversing gains from the month before, according to the National Association of Realtors. Lawrence Yun, the association's chief economist, blamed the drop on "overly stringent lending criteria" imposed by the nation's beleaguered mortgage titans, <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, that "no doubt held back contract signings."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government's recent seizure of the two lenders, which currently provide funding for around three-quarters of new home mortgages, is aimed in part at making mortgages cheaper and more accessible to prospective buyers. If the rescue works, it could be an important step in the path toward housing-market recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the government action, there were some signs that market might finally be finding its bottom. Despite the July decline in signed contracts, pending home sales were down just 6.8% from the year before, the smallest annual drop since 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But labor-market conditions, a big driver of spending and economic growth, continue to weaken. Last week, the Labor Department said the unemployment rate rose in August to 6.1%, compared with just 4.9% at the beginning of the year. On Tuesday, the department reported job openings and hiring nationwide continued to decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total job openings dipped from about 3.5 million in June to 3.4 million in July, while hiring fell more sharply, from 4.4 million in June to just over four million in July. The job-openings rate is at its lowest level since 2004, while the hiring rate fell to a five-year low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, an index of small-business optimism released Tuesday by the National Federation of Independent Business showed the percentage of firms with one or more job openings fell to 15% in August from 17% the month before. The new number matches the lowest reading so far this decade, previously recorded in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, small-business optimism improved somewhat last month from its 28-year low in July. Inflation concerns dipped a bit, and companies' economic outlooks improved from very low levels. "All in all, it is still looking like a pretty slow second half of the year," the group said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On another front, sales at the nation's wholesalers dropped 0.3% in July after four months of gains, but because the data aren't adjusted for inflation, the falling price of oil was partly to blame. Excluding oil, sales rose 0.8%, after several months of similar gains. Still, inventories accumulated more rapidly than expected, a sign that sales weren't as brisk as hoped.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're starting to see some hopeful signals in parts of the country," said Nigel Gault, chief U.S. economist at Global Insight, a Lexington, Mass.-based forecasting firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a monthly basis, home-price declines in the nation's largest cities slowed in June, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home-price indexes released Tuesday. Prices fell 0.6% on average from the month before after falling by 1% in May. The June performance was a marked improvement from monthly drops of 2% to 2.5% that occurred earlier this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But prices are still much lower than they were a year ago. Home prices in 10 major metropolitan areas in June fell 17% from the year before, though the declines appear to be moderating. The broader 20-city index showed similar patterns. A separate gauge of home prices by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, which covers more of the country but only tracks mortgages backed by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, found home prices were unchanged in June from the month before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nine of the 20 metropolitan areas tracked by the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index posted monthly price gains in June. They included Denver, where prices grew 1.5%, and Boston, where prices rose 1.2%. Phoenix, meanwhile, was the worst performer last month; prices fell 2.6%. Prices also fell sharply in Miami, Las Vegas and Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Prices are still falling very steeply in the areas that got most overheated and further declines will be necessary in those regions for sure," Mr. Gault said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, aggressive price-cutting by homebuilders and a severe pullback in construction of new homes over the past year is beginning to stabilize new-home sales, which make up about 15% of the total market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes rose by 2.4% in July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 515,000 units after falling to a revised, 17-year low in June, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. The inventory of unsold homes declined for the second month in a row, to 10.1 months' supply at the current sales pace. Still, the number of unsold homes remains at historically high levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's still a big overhang of homes on the market that need to clear," said <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> economist Michelle Meyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, the National Association of Realtors reported that there was an 11.2 months' supply of previously-owned homes for sale last month, compared to about a six-month supply that usually accompanies healthy housing markets. Sales of previously-owned homes make up about 85% of the market and have been hampered by a flood of foreclosed properties that's expected to continue through next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists caution that home sales and prices may have worsened in recent weeks as mortgage conditions have tightened, lending rates have risen, and concerns about the solvency of <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> have intensified.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, a gauge of consumer confidence produced by the Conference Board, a New York-based research group, shows consumers remain worried about current economic conditions, a sign their spending may continue to slow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overall index rose five points this month to 56.9 following levels of 51.9 in July and 51 in June, which was the lowest since 1992. The brighter outlook is largely attributed to the decline in gas prices since mid-July. Nevertheless, consumers' assessment of current conditions declined, and the percentage of those describing jobs as "plentiful" dropped for the seventh month in a row.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> economists expect consumer spending, the largest driver of U.S. economic growth, to be flat during the July-through-September period and then to decline through the first part of next year, the first such decline in consumption since the 1990-91 recession.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kelly Evans </div><div>454 words</div><div>26 August 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>9</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. sales of previously owned homes rose a healthy 3.1% in July from the previous month, but growing inventories of unsold homes and rising mortgage interest rates continue to thwart a full housing-market recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales increased to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of five million units, the highest since February, the National Association of Realtors said Monday. The increase was foreshadowed by a rise in the number of signed contracts in the past few months but nevertheless was stronger than expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are not yet ready to call the current levels a bottom but clearly most of the declines are behind us," said Adam York, a <span class="companylink">Wachovia Corp</span>. economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signs of stabilization in U.S. existing-home sales -- which make up about 85% of all home sales -- are a welcome change from the massive sales declines over the past three years, but there are signs that the market is not yet in the clear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist with MFR Inc., a New York consulting firm, noted that inventories are "very high" and "would probably be even more so if all those wishing to sell their home actually had the house on the market," rather than being scared off by weak demand and falling prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the current sales pace, there are 11.2 months' supply of homes for sale, the realtors' group said, nearly double the inventory that occurs in more normal times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plus, the pattern of sales suggests that much of the activity is occurring in parts of America where foreclosed homes are flooding the market and buyers are snapping up the deals. Sales rose "significantly" in several Florida and California markets, the group said, while the overall average and median sales prices fell. Tuesday, two widely followed home-price gauges are expected to show further declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising mortgage rates and tighter lending standards also threaten to prolong the housing market's recovery. The average interest rate for a conventional 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage rose to 6.43% in July from 6.32% the month before, according to mortgage firm <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. Although the U.S. Federal Reserve has slashed its target lending rate in the past year, mortgages rates are now just slightly below the 6.7% average last July as lending practices have tightened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The good news is the trough is behind us," said Harm Bandholz, a New York-based economist with <span class="companylink">UniCredit</span>. But, "the fundamental situation remains bleak," he said, citing tighter lending standards and rising foreclosures that will continue to put downward pressure on home prices.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing Recession Just Builds</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supply Grew in July to a Record 11.2 Months of Inventory;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That Is Trouble for Publicly Traded Sellers of New Homes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With each economic release related to the state of the housing market comes the hope that this one, finally, will prove that the residential real-estate market is on the way to recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But disappointment has been the overriding influence for those trading home-building stocks, which have made several attempts to rebound from devastating losses over the past three years, only to resume the previous downtrend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes rose 3.1% in July, compared with the June rate of sales, but the National Association of Realtors also said that housing supply grew once again, to a record 11.2 months of supply on the market. That is trouble for publicly traded sellers of new homes, which have been aggressively reducing inventory in an attempt to get ahead of the housing recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The SPDR S&amp;P Home Builders exchange-traded fund, which tracks a basket of builders, is down 2% on the year, having put together a strong recovery since mid-July, when it was down 23% on the year. That's a better performance than the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span> 500-stock index, down 12% on the year, but this ETF fell 48% in 2007, and the underlying stocks are still trying to regain their footing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts at <span class="companylink">UBS</span> are skeptical, saying they don't expect a recovery in housing until mid-2009, which could damp interest in furthering this rally. "Limited near-term positive catalysts will lead to continued volatility in the stocks over next 2-3 months," they wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday's home-sales news wasn't greeted warmly by investors in builders; the SPDR S&amp;P Home Builders fund fell 74 cents, or 3.9%, to $18.25. Len Blum, managing director at investment bank Westwood Capital, says housing isn't likely to turn around until the supply overhang is eliminated, mortgages are more readily available again, and it becomes cheaper to buy versus renting a home. The firm still expects a 10.8% decline in home prices when compared with July 2008 levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">UBS</span> says the builders that have concentrated on "proactively" reducing land positions are better-positioned for the recovery, whenever it happens. Those include <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span>, <span class="companylink">Ryland Group</span> and Centex. Shares of those stocks have been mixed on the year; Toll has gained a bit more than 14% on the year, Ryland is down 18%, and Centex is down nearly 39%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. SALES of existing homes climbed in July, rising more than expected, but inventories expanded and prices kept dropping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home resales rose to a five million annual rate, a 3.1% increase from June's revised 4.85 million annual pace, the National Association of Realtors said. The median home price was $212,400 in July, down 7.1% from a year earlier. The median price in June was $215,100.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the sales increase, inventories of homes rose 3.9% at the end of July to a record 4.67 million available for sale, which represented an 11.2-month supply at the current sales pace. There was an 11.1-month supply at the end of June.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing Story</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still Has</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many Chapters</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Children born when the housing-market collapse began have since learned to walk and talk and eat with utensils. By the time it is over, they probably will be reading and writing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week brings several key gauges of housing, and they are mostly expected to keep moving in the wrong direction. Monday, the National Association of Realtors reports July sales of pre-owned homes. Tuesday, the Commerce Department reports on new-home sales in July. Economists think resales rose a bit and new-home sales fell from June. The S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home-price index for June also is due Tuesday. That likely fell 16.5% from a year earlier, according to Wall Street estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These reports lately have offered some hope that the end of the housing debacle, which started when home prices peaked in late 2005, might finally be near. Sales seem to have flattened. A handful of cities enjoyed price increases in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are at least three keys to how much longer this mess will drag on, and none points to an early rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First are mortgage rates. Affordability has fallen as rates have risen in recent months, delaying housing's recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our initial assumption had been that things would stabilize as we got into the first part of next year," says <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> economist Ted Wieseman. "This big backup in mortgage rates puts that at significant risk."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resolving the <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>/<span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> conundrum could help. As long as the government-sponsored entities are ailing, it is harder for them to buy mortgages cheaply. That is pushing rates higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even if borrowing costs fall, the market faces a second hurdle: the credit crunch. Banks, trying to fix the balance-sheet damage already done by housing, are getting stingier with lending -- particularly to home buyers, the source of their miseries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That's typical of any credit cycle: When things get out of whack in one direction, they overcompensate in the other," says Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist at MFR. He expects sales to bottom in mid-2009 and sees no price recovery coming until six to 12 months after that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, there are still too many houses on the market. At the latest sales pace, there were about 11 months of existing homes available in June. Normally, that number is about six.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plunging home construction should help. But there are still untold numbers of houses being held off the market by wary sellers. There are millions of foreclosures and other bank-owned properties not yet available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And many recent sales have been bulk purchases of bank-owned properties by speculators, says Ivy Zelman, chief executive of housing researcher Zelman &amp;Associates. At the first thaw, they will dump those houses back on the market, pushing prices down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Zelman sees no price bottom until 2010 at the earliest and expects prices to be flat for two years after that. Other economists are more optimistic, expecting a bottom in late 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Either way, it is far from over.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates moved lower this week, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>'s weekly survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.47% nationally in the week ended Thursday, down from 6.52% last week. The mortgage also averaged 6.52% a year ago. The 15-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6% this week, down from 6.07% last week. The mortgage averaged 6.18% a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five-year Treasury-indexed hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages averaged 5.99%, down from last week's 6.02%. The ARM averaged 6.34% a year ago. One-year Treasury-indexed ARMs averaged 5.29%, up from 5.18% last week. The ARM averaged 5.60% a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Even with the current historically affordable mortgage rates, news continues to show signs of weakening in the housing sector," said Frank Nothaft, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> chief economist. "Housing starts fell to 0.965 million units [annualized] in July, the slowest pace since March 1991. As a result, home-builder confidence remained at an all-time record low in August since the series began in January 1985."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts and building permits also tumbled in the latest data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next week, house-price indexes from S&amp;P/Case-Shiller, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> will be released, which may provide signs "of whether home prices may be slowing their descent as recent monthly indices have shown or whether the observed deceleration was temporary," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage-application volume was down 1.5% last week, according to a separate report from the Mortgage Bankers Association.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kelly Evans </div><div>616 words</div><div>20 August 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soaring U.S. producer prices, which last month rose at their sharpest rate in 27 years, show inflation is still running high even as the U.S. economy slows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most Federal Reserve officials are betting inflation will moderate in the coming months as the economy cools and oil prices stabilize, but they are unlikely to act on that belief until they see evidence of sustained price stabilization. Many forecasters expect the U.S. central bank to keep its target for the federal-funds rate steady at 2% for the remainder of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some policy makers remain uneasy about price increases spreading through the economy. Officials "must remain poised to act if slowing growth fails to contain inflationary pressures," Richard Fisher, president of the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas</span>, said in a speech Tuesday. Mr. Fisher has voted against most of his colleagues on the Fed's rate-setting committee this year, pushing for rate increases during recent Fed policy meetings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We risk a reinforcing spreading of inflationary impulses and expectations," he said, cautioning that if "the Fed were to fail to address it, we would run the risk of losing the public's confidence in our ability to constrain inflation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department Tuesday said its gauge of wholesale prices -- which tracks the prices businesses pay for goods -- rose by a seasonally adjusted 1.2% in July. The index has gained 9.8% from July 2007, the highest annual increase since June 1981.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's likely that this increase does reflect the peak given that energy costs are coming off now," said <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> senior economist Peter Kretzmer. "But it's disturbing to see such broad-based gains."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, a separate report showed construction of new homes continues to drop, underscoring the weakness of the U.S. economy. Construction of new homes fell 11% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 965,000, the U.S. Commerce Department said. The drop resulted in part from an increase in multifamily construction in June before a change in New York City building codes July 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of new single-family homes, an indicator of housing-market health that feeds directly into tallies of gross domestic product, dropped 2.9% last month to an annual pace of 641,000 units. The drop suggests the weak housing market will continue to weigh on GDP even though separate data show home sales have steadied in recent months. New permits for single-family home construction dropped 5.2% in July, a sign that new-home construction will continue to be weak as builders work to sell their existing properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking at the specifics of the inflation data, the index of core prices, which excludes food and energy to gauge underlying inflation, rose 0.7% in July for a 3.5% increase from a year earlier, its highest in 17 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices rose last month on an array of goods, including passenger cars and food. Energy prices overall rose 3.1%, even though gasoline prices slipped 0.2% last month. But while energy prices are likely to come down as the cost of oil falls, prices on a wide range of goods coming through the production pipeline continued to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices on those intermediate goods rose 2.7% last month, following similar gains in May and June. Excluding food and energy, core intermediate-goods prices rose 2% and posted a 10.2% gain from last year, the highest since September 1980 -- a sign that price pressures are widespread and wholesale prices could continue to rise.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Home mortgage rates stayed mostly flat this week, as fresh economic and housing data sent mixed signals to the market, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>'s chief economist said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage didn't change at all from last week, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>'s weekly survey, remaining an average 6.52% on a nationwide basis. The mortgage averaged 6.62% a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 15-year fixed-rate mortgage slipped just slightly, averaging 6.07% for the week ending Aug. 14, down from 6.10% last week and the year-earlier 6.30%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five-year Treasury-indexed hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages averaged 6.02%, down from 6.05% last week and the year-ago 6.35%. And one-year Treasury-indexed ARMs averaged 5.18%, down from 5.22% last week and the year-earlier 5.67%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Mortgage rates held relatively steady for the second week in a row amid offsetting economic data releases," said Frank Nothaft, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> vice president and chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market received mixed news as well, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Pending existing home sales unexpectedly rose in June, signaling a possible increase in home sales in July and August, according to the National Association of Realtors. Offsetting that information was the news that commercial banks tightened lending standards even more for prime, nontraditional and subprime mortgages in July according to the Federal Reserve, an action that may dampen further home sales activity going forward."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate survey by the Mortgage Bankers Association found that mortgage applications fell a seasonally adjusted 1.5% last week, compared with the week before, driven mainly by a drop off in refinance applications.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Alan Greenspan usually surrounds his opinions with caveats and convoluted clauses. But ask his view of the government's response to problems confronting mortgage giants <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, and he offers one word: "Bad."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a conversation this week, the former Federal Reserve chairman also said he expects that U.S. house prices, a key factor in the outlook for the economy and financial markets, will begin to stabilize in the first half of next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home prices in the U.S. are likely to start to stabilize or touch bottom sometime in the first half of 2009," he said in an interview. Tracing a jagged curve with his finger on a tabletop to underscore the difficulty in pinpointing the precise trough, he cautioned that even at a bottom, "prices could continue to drift lower through 2009 and beyond."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A long-time student of housing markets, Mr. Greenspan now works out of a well-windowed, oval-shaped office that is evidence of his fascination with the housing market. His desk, couch, coffee table and conference table are strewn with printouts of spreadsheets and multicolored charts of housing starts, foreclosures and population trends siphoned from government and trade association sources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An end to the decline in house prices, he explained, matters not only to American homeowners but is "a necessary condition for an end to the current global financial crisis" he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Stable home prices will clarify the level of equity in homes, the ultimate collateral support for much of the financial world's mortgage-backed securities. We won't really know the market value of the asset side of the banking system's balance sheet -- and hence banks' capital -- until then."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 82 years old, Mr. Greenspan remains sharp and his fascination with the workings of the economy undiminished. But his star no longer shines as brightly as it did when he retired from the Fed in January 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Greenspan has been criticized for contributing to today's woes by keeping interest rates too low too long and by regulating too lightly. He has been aggressively defending his record -- in interviews, in op-ed pieces and in a new chapter in his recent book, included in the paperback version to be published next month. Mr. Greenspan attributes the rise in house prices to a historically unusual period in which world markets pushed interest rates down and even sophisticated investors misjudged the risks they were taking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His views remain widely watched, however. Mr. Greenspan's housing forecast rests on two pillars of data. One is the supply of vacant, single-family homes for sale, both newly completed homes and existing homes owned by investors and lenders. He sees that "excess supply" -- roughly 800,000 units above normal -- diminishing soon. The other is a comparison of the current price of houses -- he prefers the quarterly S&amp;P Case Shiller National Home Price Index because it includes both urban and rural areas -- with the government's estimate of what it costs to rent a single-family house. As other economists do, Mr. Greenspan essentially seeks to gauge when it is rational to own a house and when it is rational to sell the house, invest the money elsewhere and rent an identical house next door.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's the imbalance of supply and demand which causes prices to go down, but it's ultimately the valuation process of the use of the commodity . . . which tells you where the bottom is," Mr. Greenspan said, recalling his days trading copper a half century ago. "For example, the grain markets can have a huge excess of corn or wheat, but the price never goes to zero. It'll stabilize at some level of prices where people are willing to hold the excess inventory. We have little history, but the same thing is surely true in housing as well. We will get to the point where there will be willing holders of vacant single-family dwellings, and that will no longer act to depress the price level."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The collapse in home prices, of course, is a major threat to the stability of Fannie and Freddie. At the Fed, Mr. Greenspan warned for years that the two mortgage giants' business model threatened the nation's financial stability. He acknowledges that a government backstop for the shareholder-owned, government-sponsored enterprises, or GSEs, was unavoidable. Not only are they crucial to the ailing mortgage market now, but the Fed-financed takeover of investment bank <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns Cos</span>. also made government backing of Fannie and Freddie debt "inevitable," he said. "There's no credible argument for bailing out <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns</span> and not the GSEs."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His quarrel is with the approach the Bush administration sold to Congress. "They should have wiped out the shareholders, nationalized the institutions with legislation that they are to be reconstituted -- with necessary taxpayer support to make them financially viable -- as five or 10 individual privately held units," which the government would eventually auction off to private investors, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, Congress granted Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson temporary authority to use an unlimited amount of taxpayer money to lend to or invest in the companies. In response to the Greenspan critique, Mr. Paulson's spokeswoman, Michele Davis, said, "This legislation accomplished two important goals -- providing confidence in the immediate term as these institutions play a critical role in weathering the housing correction, and putting in place a new regulator with all the authorities necessary to address systemic risk posed by the GSEs."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a similar critique has been raised by several other prominent observers. "If they are too big to fail, make them smaller," former Nixon Treasury Secretary George Shultz said. Some say the Paulson approach, even if the government never spends a nickel, entrenches current management and offers shareholders the upside if the government's reassurance allows the companies to weather the current storm. The Treasury hasn't said what conditions it would impose if it offers Fannie and Freddie taxpayer money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fear that financial markets would react poorly if the U.S. government nationalized the companies and assumed their approximately $5 trillion debt is unfounded, Mr. Greenspan said. "The law that stipulates that GSEs are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government is disbelieved. The market believes the government guarantee is there. Foreigners believe the guarantee is there. The only fiscal change is for someone to change the bookkeeping."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past, to be sure, Mr. Greenspan's crystal ball has been cloudy. He didn't foresee the sharp national decline in home prices. Recently released transcripts of Fed meetings do record him warning in November 2002: "It's hard to escape the conclusion that at some point our extraordinary housing boom . . . cannot continue indefinitely into the future."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Publicly, he was more reassuring. "While local economies may experience significant speculative price imbalances, a national severe price distortion seems most unlikely in the United States, given its size and diversity," he said in October 2004. Eight months later, he said if home prices did decline, that "likely would not have substantial macroeconomic implications." And in a speech in October 2006, nine months after leaving the Fed, he told an audience that, though housing prices were likely to be lower than the year before, "I think the worst of this may well be over." Housing prices, by his preferred gauge, have fallen nearly 19% since then. He says he was referring not to prices but to the downward drag on economic growth from weakening housing construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Greenspan urges the government to avoid tax or other policies that increase the construction of new homes because that would delay the much-desired day when home prices find a bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He did offer one suggestion: "The most effective initiative, though politically difficult, would be a major expansion in quotas for skilled immigrants," he said. The only sustainable way to increase demand for vacant houses is to spur the formation of new households. Admitting more skilled immigrants, who tend to earn enough to buy homes, would accomplish that while paying other dividends to the U.S. economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He estimates the number of new households in the U.S. currently is increasing at an annual rate of about 800,000, of whom about one third are immigrants. "Perhaps 150,000 of those are loosely classified as skilled," he said. "A double or tripling of this number would markedly accelerate the absorption of unsold housing inventory for sale -- and hence help stabilize prices."</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>490 words</div><div>13 August 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes listed for sale continues to edge lower in many metropolitan areas, though supplies remain ample.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of homes available for sale in 29 major metropolitan areas in July was down 0.5% from a month earlier, according to figures compiled by ZipRealty Inc., a real-estate brokerage firm based in Emeryville, Calif. The supply has begun to erode partly because some would-be sellers have given up and withdrawn their homes from the market for now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ZipRealty data cover all listings of single-family homes, condominiums and town houses on local multiple-listing services in areas where the firm operates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past two decades, the number of listed homes typically has declined slightly in July as the peak spring/summer selling season winds down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, about 4.5 million previously occupied homes were listed for sale at the end of June, according to the National Association of Realtors. At the current sales rate, that total is enough to last about 11 months, the trade group says. The market is considered roughly in balance between supply and demand when the inventory is enough to last around six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The largest declines in July from a month earlier were in the metro areas of Boston (-4.2%) and Tucson, Ariz. (-3.5%). The biggest increases were in the metro areas of Sacramento, Calif. (6.9%), and Phoenix (6.1%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patrick Lashinsky, ZipRealty's chief executive, says home sales have been relatively strong recently in the Boston, Las Vegas, Riverside-San Bernardino, Calif., and Sacramento areas. Prices have fallen far enough in those areas to attract some bargain hunters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The July inventory was down 3.8% from a year earlier in 18 metro markets for which comparable year-earlier data are available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Zip data don't include New York. But Miller Samuel Inc., an appraisal firm based there, says there were 6,441 cooperative apartments and condominiums available in Manhattan at the end of July, down 6.2% from June. The Manhattan market has been cooling recently as Wall Street firms shrink their staffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory figures from Zip and the Realtors probably understate the supply of homes because not all foreclosed properties that lenders are trying to sell are listed on multiple-listing services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a report issued last week, Julia Coronado, an economist at <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span> in New York, said the housing market may start to bottom out by year end. Home sales in 2009 are likely to flatten out near current low levels, she said. "We expect some further downward pressure on prices through 2009 as inventories continue to be worked off," Ms. Coronado wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing construction "appears to have fallen below the pace consistent with population growth," she said, and price declines have made housing more affordable in many areas.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE NUMBER of U.S. workers filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week to a six-year high, as the recent extension of jobless benefits continued to draw new claimants. The data suggest the outlook for labor markets and consumer spending remains bleak as households face high energy prices and falling home values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the National Association of Realtors' index for pending sales of existing homes increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.3% to 89.0 in June from a downwardly revised reading of 84.5 in May, the industry group said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jessica Holzer </div><div>348 words</div><div>6 August 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Pulte Homes Inc</span>., one of the country's largest home builders, says it will match a new $7,500 tax credit for first-time home buyers with its own $7,500 discount on homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The goal of the offer, which the company plans to extend to any buyer of a Pulte home, is "to draw attention not only to our homes but to the housing market in general," said Richard J. Dugas, Pulte's president and chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders lobbied hard for the tax credit, which was signed into law last week as part of a large housing-rescue package. Now, the industry is working to spread the word to consumers, hoping the tax break will help pull the housing market out of the doldrums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sandy Dunn, president of the National Association of Home Builders, says many would-be first-time buyers are in a strong position to purchase a home today, but remain jittery about the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This tax credit will help get them off the fence," she said Monday in a conference call with reporters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time home buyers account for 40% of all buyers, according to the NAHB. They are seen by the industry as the key to reviving the housing market because, unlike existing homeowners, they don't have to unload a home before buying a new one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax credit applies to primary residences bought by individuals making up to $75,000 a year or married couples with combined income of up to $150,000 a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To qualify as a first-time home buyer under the law, a person can't have owned a home in three years. Only home purchases closed between April 8, 2008, and July 1, 2009, will qualify for the credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home-builders' lobby group launched a Web site to promote the credit, at www.federalhousingtaxcredit.com[http://www.federalhousingtaxcredit.com]. It has received 57,000 visitors since last Wednesday, says Rob Dietz, the NAHB's director of tax issues.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kelly Evans </div><div>796 words</div><div>5 August 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp;Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real personal income in the U.S. increased 3.4% in June from a year earlier and real consumer spending increased 1.2% in the same period. A chart showing the annual change in these indicators that accompanied Tuesday's article on the U.S. economy failed to specify that the data were adjusted for inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(WSJ Aug. 6, 2008)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer spending in the U.S. increased in June as people spent their economic-stimulus checks, but prices rose even more, thrusting inflation worries back into the spotlight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department report, which also showed that income growth continued to slow, is "an unpleasant constellation" ahead of Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy committee, said Harm Bandholz, an economist with <span class="companylink">UniCredit</span> in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commerce said an inflation gauge tied to consumer spending rose 0.8% in June from the month before, the most since February 1981, and gained 4.1% from a year earlier. Still, the Fed is widely expected to hold interest rates steady at its meeting Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Policy makers still expect the slowing U.S. and global economy will help cool rising prices in the coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personal consumption, the government's gauge of consumer spending, rose 0.6% in June from the previous month, after posting a similarly strong 0.8% gain in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results reflect the distribution of some $27.9 billion in economic stimulus checks in June. A bigger chunk -- $50 billion -- was distributed in May and at the end of April. Much of the remainder of the $106.7 billion program was distributed by mid-July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while spending rose 0.6% last month, the 0.8% rise in consumer prices was even quicker. Adjusting for inflation, personal consumption actually dropped 0.2% in June from the month before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, spending was strong in May, so by comparison the June decline isn't cataclysmic. But consumer spending is closely watched because it drives more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, and consumers have struggled this year with falling home prices, rising unemployment, and rising prices, especially for food and fuel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If consumer spending continues to decline, especially in the absence of another round of economic stimulus checks, it could prompt U.S. growth to contract again later this year. Gross domestic product, the official measure of economic growth output, declined during the final three months of 2007 before growing 0.9% in the first quarter of this year and 1.9% in the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The threat to growth is dominating the threat of inflation" for now, said David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities, adding that he thinks the U.S. is currently in recession. "There definitely is danger in the second half of this year when the fiscal stimulus effects are gone."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price index for personal consumption expenditures -- an inflation gauge closely watched by the Federal Reserve -- rose more than expected in June, a month marked by surging crude oil prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The PCE price index rose 0.8% in June and gained 4.1% from the same month a year ago. Excluding food and energy, core inflation -- which is used to gauge underlying price pressures -- rose 0.3% in June and climbed 2.3% from a year earlier, following a 2.2% yearly gain in May. The acceleration continues to put the rate of core inflation above the 1.5%-2% range that most Fed policy makers say represents price stability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while prices continue to rise, the report separately showed that income growth slowed in June. Personal income rose by 0.1% at a seasonally adjusted annual rate compared with the month before -- the smallest gain since the growth rate was reported as flat in April 2007. The growth rate slowed partly because incomes jumped 1.8% in May. Income after taxes, or disposable personal income, dropped by 1.9% after rising 5.7% in May, when consumers started spending their stimulus checks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personal saving, as a percentage of disposable income, was 2.5% in June following a leap to 4.9% in May, boosted by stimulus checks that weren't fully spent right away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate Commerce Department report also released Monday showed orders for goods at U.S. factories were stronger than expected in June, rising 1.7%, but the results largely reflect higher prices paid rather than a higher volume of goods ordered. Also within the report, a key gauge of business capital spending was revised to show a 1.2% gain in June, lower than the 1.4% originally reported.</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>1090 words</div><div>29 July 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes on the market is finally falling in much of the U.S., but tight credit and a flood of foreclosures are still pushing home prices down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Making things worse, a sputtering economy is destroying jobs. That means even more foreclosures and fewer potential home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Zandi, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's Corp</span>. Economy.com, says he doesn't expect a major rebound in home sales and prices before the spring of 2010. "The recovery will vary considerably across the country, with California recovering quickly and Florida much more slowly," Mr. Zandi says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have the added weight of a recessionary economy" on what was already the weakest housing market since the 1930s, says Jeffrey Otteau, president of Otteau Valuation Group, an East Brunswick, N.J., appraisal firm. He says the market won't recover fully until employment starts growing again and credit becomes more readily available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wall Street Journal's quarterly survey of housing data in 28 major metropolitan areas showed that the supply of homes listed for sale declined from a year earlier in 19 of them. If that trend continues, it will signal an eventual rebound. For now, though, supplies remain so ample that potential buyers generally can take their time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's just a great big waiting game," says Dane Valatka, a mechanical engineer in Chandler, Ariz., near Phoenix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Valatka and his wife moved to the Phoenix area nine months ago and are renting while waiting to buy a house. They have zeroed in on a six-bedroom home with a four-car garage. Mr. Valatka, a collector of vintage Ford cars, covets that garage and its epoxy-coated floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Valatkas have offered $250,000, compared with the $410,000 the home fetched in June 2007, according to RealQuest.com, a data service of First American CoreLogic Inc. That matches the asking price. Because the offer wouldn't cover the amount due on the current owners' mortgages, however, the deal is subject to approval by the lender.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Valatka says he has refused a request from the lender for a higher offer and has been waiting for weeks to hear whether his current offer will be accepted. (Mr. Valatka's real-estate agent, who is handling the negotiations, declined to identify the lender.) The long wait for a response is "infuriatingly frustrating," Mr. Valatka says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress last week approved a 694-page package of legislation aimed at bolstering the housing market. That bill gives the Treasury authority to provide loans or equity capital if needed to shore up government-sponsored mortgage investors <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the main suppliers of funding for home loans. The legislation also includes a tax break for first-time home buyers and a refinancing plan for some distressed borrowers. But housing economists don't expect the package to provide a major boost to the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the biggest factor pushing down home prices is the growing glut of foreclosed homes that banks and mortgage investors must sell. In May, such homes accounted for nearly 22% of all sales nationwide, <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span> estimates in a report released last week. In California, Arizona and Nevada, the share was around 40%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are about 721,000 foreclosed homes on the market nationwide, up from 112,000 two years ago, <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span> estimates. Analysts at <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> expect the total to rise 60% before peaking in late 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another big problem is that many homeowners are trapped in homes that no longer could be sold for enough money to pay off the mortgage. Among homeowners in the Las Vegas area who have bought their homes since January 2003, about 61% owe more on their mortgages than the current value of their homes, Zillow.com estimates. That figure is about 59% in the Detroit and San Diego areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many potential buyers are on the sidelines because they no longer qualify for a mortgage under today's tougher standards. "They're having to clean their credit up" and save for a down payment, says John Wood, who owns Re/Max Partners, which operates in the Raleigh, N.C., area. "That is certainly hurting our market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who can get a loan are finding it more expensive. Rates for 30-year fixed loans that conform with the standards of Fannie and Freddie last week averaged 6.69%, up from 6.55% a month before and about even with the year-earlier level, according to surveys by HSH Associates, a financial publisher. For "jumbo" mortgages, those too large to be purchased by Fannie or Freddie, rates last week averaged 7.70%, up from 7.65% a month earlier and 7.02% a year before, HSH says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As always, the market varies considerably from city to city and even block to block. The most attractive neighborhoods with short commutes and excellent schools are holding up well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing markets generally are considered roughly in balance when the number of homes listed for sale is enough to last about six months at the current sales rate. Based on the average sales rate over the past year, The Wall Street Journal survey shows that supplies are enough to last about 13 months in the Atlanta and Phoenix areas, 15 months in Chicago, 19 months in Las Vegas, and 37 months in Miami-Fort Lauderdale. For condominiums alone in Miami-Dade County, the supply is enough to last 51 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan, a market that until recently seemed immune to the housing slump, is suffering from the loss of Wall Street jobs and expected cuts in bonuses. A modest price fall in 2009 is "a distinct possibility" for Manhattan, says Jonathan Miller, chief executive officer of Miller Samuel, an appraisal firm based in New York. Jeffrey Jackson, chief economist at the appraisal firm Mitchell, Maxwell &amp;Jackson, says prices already have fallen on mediocre Manhattan apartments -- such as those that have little natural light or need repairs -- and are likely to fall further. "Demand is very weak right now," he says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The demand for expensive goods rose in June, and consumer sentiment climbed this month, according to data yielding unexpected signs of economic strength.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for durable goods, or goods lasting at least three years, such as televisions, climbed 0.8% last month to a seasonally adjusted $215.43 billion, the Commerce Department reported Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The trend here is it's relatively soft but it's not horrible," said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James. "It's not what we would typically see in a recession. Perhaps exports is offsetting the softness in domestic demand."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report showed that sales of single-family homes fell 0.6% in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 530,000. The drop, the fifth in six months, was smaller than expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday's data showed a barometer of business equipment spending -- orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft -- increased 1.4% in June after falling 0.1% in May. Year over year, the barometer has increased 3.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On consumer sentiment, the Reuters/University of Michigan consumer-sentiment index was 61.2 in July, up from 56.4 in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inflation expectations remained high, with the one-year inflation-expectations index coming in at 5.1%, unchanged from June. The five-year inflation-expectations reading eased to 3.2% from 3.4% the month before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers' improved outlook was likely the result of the drop in oil prices in recent weeks, said Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist of MFR Inc. But he added that "a very weak trend for consumer spending is the most likely scenario in the near to medium term, with debt-laden households facing a weakening labor market" and other problems.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of U.S. workers filing new claims for unemployment benefits soared last week, suggesting no stabilization is in sight for labor markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial claims for jobless benefits rose 34,000 to 406,000 after seasonal adjustments in the week ended July 19, the Labor Department said Thursday. It matched the level of late March, which was the highest since September 2005, after Hurricane Katrina.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, total claims lasting more than one week fell slightly but remained at about the three-million mark for a 13th straight week, an indication that it is taking the unemployed much longer to find new work than it did a few months ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> economists noted the level of initial claims -- above 400,000 -- was close to the level during most of the 2001 recession. They added "initial jobless claims can be particularly volatile around this time of year, as the precise timing of auto industry shutdowns can vary year-to-year, making seasonal adjustment difficult."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, existing-home sales in the U.S. resumed falling in June and the median price also dropped as inventories crept higher. Sales fell to a 4.86 million annual rate, a 2.6% decrease from May's pace, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home price was $215,100 in June, down 6.1% from $229,000 in June 2007. The median price in May this year was $207,900.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Labor Department analyst explained Thursday that government statisticians "got the layoffs we were expecting, but not quite in the weeks we were expecting." The four-week average -- which smoothes out weekly volatility -- rose by 4,500 to 382,500, a three-week high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonfarm payrolls have fallen for six straight months, and recent jobless claims data point to another decline when July data are released next week.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jeff Bater </div><div>565 words</div><div>18 July 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A twist to New York City building codes sent U.S. home construction surging during June, but, absent the quirk, housing starts fell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts increased 9.1% from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted 1.1 million annual rate, the Commerce Department said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gain was driven by soaring apartment construction, which was related to the New York building-rules change. Aside from the boost given by the building-regulation change, U.S. housing starts fell 4% in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York City enacted a new set of construction codes effective for permits authorized as of July 1. The deadline triggered a large increase in building permits issued for apartment buildings in the city during June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Builders . . .wanted to get in the ground in June ahead of the new, more stringent regulations," said Joshua Shapiro, an analyst at MFR Inc. With the boost from the rush to secure permits in New York City, U.S. building permits climbed 12% to a 1.1 million rate in June. May permits decreased by 0.4% to 978,000. Permits act as a harbinger to actual building. Excluding the Northeast multifamily data, U.S. permits rose 0.7% in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of the way housing data are calculated, the jump in New York permits affected the starts numbers, the Commerce Department said. "This report is much weaker than it looks," said Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist for High Frequency Economics. "Ignore the headlines in this report; expect a big drop next month."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">May housing starts fell 2.7% to 977,000. Year over year, housing starts in June were 27% below the level of construction in June 2007. The last time housing made a positive contribution to the economy was in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The collapse in the housing market is the root cause of much of the problems facing the financial sector and the economy," said Joel Naroff, president and chief economist of Naroff Economic Advisors. "If we are to get out of this mess, housing has to turn. It is still unclear from this report to what extent that may be happening."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overbuilding sent the market falling, with inventories of unsold homes bloating and causing prices to drop. Would-be buyers aren't signing so fast these days, instead waiting for a better deal. Receding demand for new homes has slowed builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Reducing inventories will require that housing prices drop much further, and that builders refrain from putting up new homes," said Global Insight economist Patrick Newport. "Our view is that housing starts will drop more than 15% from current levels, and may not turn around until next year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">June single-family housing starts decreased 5.3% to 647,000. Single-family permits fell 3.5%. Construction of housing with two or more units surged 43% to 419,000; within that category, groundbreakings of homes with five or more units -- or multifamily -- were 44% higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Despite [June's] surge, multifamily housing starts will decline significantly [in July]," Insight Economics analyst Steven Wood said. "Housing's contribution to economic growth will be substantially negative again in [the second quarter]."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Labor Department reported that new claims by idled U.S. workers seeking unemployment benefits rose last week by 18,000, to 366,000.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- Prices of U.S. Treasury securities continued to fall Thursday, extending Wednesday's losses that came on growing inflation fears. A weaker-than-expected reading on regional business activity lent some support to prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late morning, the benchmark 10-year note was trading at 99 4/32, down 12/32. Its yield rose to 3.98% from 3.934% Wednesday, as yields move inversely to prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said its June index of general business conditions moved to negative 17.1 from negative 15.6 in May. The survey showed broad-based weakness and some of the strongest gains came in an unwelcome arena: prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treasurys came under pressure early in the day on news of an unexpected jump in U.S. housing starts last month. June housing starts rose 9.1%; however, the surge was due to a change to New York City building codes, and excluding the adjustment, housing starts tumbled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere, a smaller-than-expected rise in weekly jobless claims boosted prospects for a U.S. rate increase by year end.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Robert Frank </div><div>1032 words</div><div>16 July 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN MARCH, I wrote about the case of Dru Schmitt, a medical-data tycoon who built a 2,070-square-meter mansion near Boca Raton, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schmitt and his wife thought they were building their dream home. Instead, their French Country Manor-style mansion turned into a nightmare, and they put it on the market just days after moving in. The problem: It was too big. I called it Oversized Mansion Syndrome, or OMS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, a couple in Greenwich, Conn., has come down with another case of OMS. According to an article in the New York Times by Eric Konigsberg, Stan and Dorothea Cheslock are putting their 2,340-square-meter dream home up for auction because it's "too much house for us."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house has a "kind of French-Mediterranean-Italian thing going on," says Ms. Cheslock. It has a wine cellar, Siberian spruce sauna, billiard room, lap pool, movie theater, indoor Tuscan courtyard and a French bird-cage elevator that rises 12 meters to the cupola -- which, Ms. Cheslock says, only gets used when guests want to see the cupola.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Says Mrs. Cheslock: "We don't belong in it, basically. It's like a Cinderella house. Hey, I got the prince, but the castle isn't for me."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's entirely possible that the Cheslocks are selling for the reason they cite -- a house that's too big. But the real reason is most likely financial. Why else would they unload their place with a sealed-bid auction in this market? Mr. Cheslock made his money from merchant banking, and with markets in the tank, bankers are getting pinched -- to the point that $200,000 a year for a chef, groundskeepers and gardeners starts to hurt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Cheslocks tried unsuccessfully to sell the house in 2006 for $31 million. Bids for the current auction start at $19 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe Oversized Mansion Syndrome is just a symptom for a different malady: Sudden Wealth Loss Syndrome.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Secret to marrying</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">a billionaire: brains</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE KEY to marrying a billionaire, according to the media, is beauty. Grace, charm, intelligence, manners and a talent for flattery help, of course. Yet from Doris Duke to Melania Trump, billionaire wives have been expected first and foremost to be stunners -- well-decorated accessories and showcases for their husband's wealth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But today's billionaires are different. They want an equal, not a bauble. Forbes's most-recent Billionaire Wives List declares that "looks are great -- but brains are even better." It also helps for a billionaire wife to be successful in her own right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sergey Brin -- In 2007, the Google guy married Ann Wojcicki, who he met when he sublet a garage from Ms. Wojcicki's sister. She is a Yale grad who was working as a health-care analyst when they met. She has now launched her own biotech firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Larry Page -- The other Google guy married Lucy Southworth, a Stanford "biomedical informatics doctoral student" -- which sure beats "interior decorator" as far as billionaire-wife job titles go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenneth Griffin -- The Citadel hedge-fund chief is married to Anne Dias Griffin, who runs her own asset-management firm, Aragon Global Management. This is proof that the key to a good financial marriage -- unlike the key to a good hedge fund -- is high correlations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Dell -- The computer king's wife, Susan Dell (pictured above), is no slouch in the business department. She's chairman of her own fashion line, called Phi, and a triathlete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Snooping on the rich</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">via helicopter, plane</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A COUPLE of years ago, Forbes magazine came out with a list of top billionaire homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What were remarkable were the aerial photos of mansions owned by super-private billionaires such as Bill Gates, Michael Dell, George Lucas and Abigail Johnson of Fidelity. Many appear to have been shot from a helicopter or plane -- making the lack of cooperation from the owners meaningless.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vanity Fair followed up in July 2006 with an article about hedge-funder wealth in Greenwich, Conn. To illustrate Nina Munk's highly entertaining story, the magazine ran crystal-clear photos of homes owned by Steven Cohen, Paul Tudor Jones II and others. The photo of the Cohens' home was especially awe-inspiring, showing 2,880 square meters of house with various outbuildings, a tennis court, English gardens, ice rink and a little gabled house for the Zamboni. It also showed several cars in the driveway, with two people standing near the front entrance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This month, Vanity Fair re-enters the air war with photos of several mansions in the Hamptons. The article, about the local real-estate market, features a shot of a home bought by hedge-fund billionaire John Paulson. The article also has a photo of Steve Schwarzman's monster compound, still under construction. (You can even see the vans and construction workers.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this makes for mesmerizing reading -- and great voyeurism. And it marks a new level of media probing into the lives of the wealthy -- a collision between the celebrity culture and the new Gilded Age.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But are there limits? How far can a photographer or reporter peer into someone's house and life from on high?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To get some insight, I called Elizabeth A. McNamara, a media lawyer and privacy expert at Davis Wright Tremaine LLP in New York. Ms. McNamara said that generally speaking, it's all right to take aerial photos of objects that are readily visible to the naked eye, since they're taken from public airspace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The possibility of trouble arises when people use high-powered telephoto lenses. If a photo reveals a home's security operations or shows close ups of people, there could be an argument for an invasion-of-privacy claim. She said that "capturing someone sitting on their patio sunbathing nude" could create a legal challenge but added that "if you're just showing that someone has this lovely home, I'm not sure that would be a compelling argument for a claim."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the heart of the near-panic rocking <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> is a vicious cycle gripping the U.S. housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It starts with the oversupply of homes, which is causing prices to plummet. Falling prices are leading to more foreclosures, as homeowners have difficulty refinancing their mortgages or selling their houses. Banks are reluctant to lend freely at a time when home values keep sinking and defaults keep rising. That is crimping housing demand further and leading to more price drops and defaults.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This phenomenon -- which some economists call a "negative feedback loop" -- began with subprime borrowers but has gone well beyond the small segment of borrowers with poor credit. It is now spreading to the much-larger market of prime borrowers, which forms the bread and butter of Fannie and Freddie's mortgage assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actual credit-related losses at Fannie and Freddie have been relatively small when compared with their huge size. In the first quarter, for example, <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> reported $3.2 billion of credit-related expenses, mostly provisions for expected losses on mortgage defaults. That is a small fraction of the $3 trillion of mortgages Fannie currently owns or guarantees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the companies have been suffering a crisis of confidence because it isn't clear how big credit-related losses will eventually become. Much of that could depend on how far home prices continue to slide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"House-price declines are at the root of all our economic and financial problems," says Mark Zandi, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com and author of "Financial Shock," a new book about the collapse of the subprime-mortgage market. "Investors can't tell where the bottom is or how far mortgage-related assets have to be written down. That's shaking even blue-chip institutions like Fannie and Freddie."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One problem with trying to assess when home prices will stop falling is that the typical measures economists use to determine signs of a recovery may not be as useful in this downturn. For example, when measuring the relationship between house prices and household incomes, it would seem they are returning to a healthy balance. During the housing boom, loose lending standards and speculative buying pushed house-price inflation way above the sluggish rise in household incomes. But in the second quarter, Mr. Zandi estimates, the ratio of home prices to annual incomes has come down to near its 17-year average of 1.88 from a recent peak of 2.39.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also coming into balance, though not there quite yet, is the ratio of home prices to rents. The lower the ratio, the more people are likely to buy a home than rent one. Mr. Zandi estimates that this ratio dropped to 20.02 in the second quarter from a high of 24.90 during the boom. The average ratio from 1985 to 2002 was 14.44. "If you just look at affordability indices, we would say we are probably close to a bottom," says Ivy Zelman, a housing and homebuilding analyst. "But these are not normal times."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For sure. During the previous housing downturn, prices fell 2.8% nationwide in the period 1990 to 1991, according to the Fiserv Case Shiller national home-price index. (In the hard-hit state of California, prices fell 16.7% over about five years before bottoming in 1995.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those levels have already been exceeded this time around. As of the first quarter, the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller national home-price index had fallen about 16% from its peak in the second quarter of 2006. Prices in California were down about 29% during that same time period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Better indicators for assessing when conditions might improve for the housing market can be found in the foreclosure numbers. Right now, it is the overhang of foreclosure inventory that is helping to drive the staggering home price declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes in the foreclosure process -- as of the end of June, there were 681,000 homeowners with first mortgages that were in default, which is up from 313,000 a year ago -- is such a problem that banks are slashing prices on those homes in an effort to sell them quickly. That is partly because they fear prices will keep falling. But the banks are also being nudged by the rising costs of holding onto vacant homes -- insurance, lawn care and fines from cities and towns if the property falls into disrepair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Sacramento, Calif., area, where 65% of the sales by Realtors in May involved bank-owned houses, the median home price fell to $230,250, down 34% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The banks are taking hits on all price ranges and house styles. For example. a three-bedroom home in Scottsdale, Ariz., featuring granite countertops and views of Pinnacle Peak, sold in March for $855,000, down from the $1.65 million it fetched in February 2007. A two-bedroom home recently sold in Cape Coral, Fla., for $267,500. That home had sold for $535,000 in March 2006 to buyers who financed 100% of the cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks also feel pressure to sell because the rate of new foreclosures continues to rise rapidly. The Mortgage Bankers Association reports that more than 500,000 foreclosures were started in the first quarter of this year alone. "The inflow [of homes into bank ownership] is outpacing the outflow," says Chad Neel, president of Loan Portfolio Solutions, Denver, which manages the sale of foreclosed homes on behalf of banks. But he says, "Properties will sell if they're priced right."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is right for banks, though, can be wrong for neighboring homeowners. As foreclosed sales drive down neighborhood home values, "people are now finding that their current mortgage balance is 30% higher than the value of their home," says Thomas Lawler, a housing economist based in Leesburg, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the time it takes to clear out the inventory of foreclosed homes may vary greatly by state. In California, foreclosures are typically resolved through a nonjudicial process, which may be helping lenders take possession of the houses and get them sold relatively quickly. In Florida, on the other hand, lenders have to pursue foreclosures through the local court systems, which is leading to backups in some markets, Mr. Lawler says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The delay means that large price drops could hit some Florida markets when these foreclosed homes finally work their way through the system. "There are some markets where the disposition wave hasn't fully hit," he says. That process could take many more months, prolonging housing's downward spiral.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government can help stem the slide, but don't expect a perfect fix. "The government can't stop falling prices," says David Kotok, chairman and chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors in Vineland, N.J. "When you have falling sentiment and buyers who can defer decisions, they will defer until they think prices have hit bottom basement. I don't think the government can do anything to alter that psychology."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What government can do, says Mr. Kotok, is repair the credit markets so that there is more faith and credibility in the nation's financial system.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of homes available for sale in 18 major metropolitan areas in June was down 2.4% from a year earlier, according to figures compiled by ZipRealty Inc., a real-estate brokerage firm based in Emeryville, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data cover listings of single-family homes, condominiums and town houses on local multiple-listing services in those areas. It was the first decline for the 18 markets since Zip began collecting the inventory data in mid-2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zip said inventory totals in June were about even with those a month earlier in the 18 metro areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the supply of homes listed for sale has leveled off after soaring in recent years, it remains plentiful. Nationwide, about 4.5 million previously occupied homes were listed for sale at the end of May, according to the National Association of Realtors. That is enough to last nearly 11 months at the current sales rate, the trade group says. The market is considered roughly in balance between supply and demand when the inventory is enough to last around six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Zip data don't include New York. But Miller Samuel Inc., an appraisal firm based there, says there were 6,869 cooperative apartments and condominiums available in Manhattan at the end of June, up 31% from a year earlier. Manhattan has remained one of the nation's strongest markets but is cooling as Wall Street firms shed employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures from Zip and the Realtors probably understate the supply of homes because not all foreclosed properties that lenders are trying to sell are listed on multiple-listing services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Integrated Asset Services LLC, a Denver-based company that helps banks value and sell foreclosed homes, said its index shows that the median U.S. home price in May was down 3.2% from April and down 20% from May 2007.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A forecasting gauge of home sales turned down in May, suggesting the housing market continues to decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors' index of pending sales of previously owned homes fell 4.7% to 84.7 from April, the industry group said Tuesday. The decrease followed a sharp increase of 7.1% in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is still much too early to call this the bottom of the market," High Frequency Economics analyst Ian Shepherdson said. "Housing is still desperately weak." The index is based on pending sales, or those in which the contract has been signed but the transaction hasn't closed, of existing homes, including single-family homes and condominiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve reported that U.S. consumer credit in May grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.6% to $2.571 trillion amid a faltering economy and rising energy costs.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. construction spending declined in May, brought down once again by the sickly housing sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index beat expectations in June by coming in at 50.2 compared with 49.6 in May, the first advance after four consecutive months of contraction. Readings above 50 imply expansion, while those under 50 indicate contraction. The June index figure had been forecast at 48.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The current level of the index is consistent with a stagnant manufacturing sector and a slowly growing overall economy," Insight Economics analyst Steven Wood said. "For the index to suggest a recession in the broad economy, it would have to fall to around 44."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total construction spending fell 0.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.085 trillion, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">April spending fell by an upwardly revised 0.1%; originally, the U.S. government said spending that month dropped 0.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 0.4% decrease in May outlays was better than projected. Wall Street had expected construction spending for the month would decline 0.5%. It was the fifth drop in construction spending in six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential construction spending decreased 1.6% in May to $385.9 billion. Residential spending also fell 1.6% in April; it was originally seen down 2.1% for the month. Spending in the sector was 26.9% lower in May from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonresidential construction spending rose 0.3% in May. Spending climbed on construction of hotels, offices and power facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private-sector construction spending dropped 0.7% to $784.2 billion. Spending was flat in April.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anton Troianovski </div><div>542 words</div><div>2 July 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. manufacturing expanded in June, snapping a four-month string of declines, but a gauge of prices jumped to its highest point in almost three decades, underscoring the perils facing the economy in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management's index of factory activity rose to 50.2, just above the 50-mark that signals expansion. The reading was 49.6 in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group's measure of prices paid by manufacturers shot up to the highest level since 1979, reflecting surging energy costs that may drive prices even higher, potentially depressing consumer demand. The group's price index rose to 91.5 in June from 87 in May. Of the commodities tracked by the survey, all but one -- copper -- rose in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a huge amount of demand destruction that took place at $4 a gallon of gasoline that we just didn't see at $3," Norbert Ore, the <span class="companylink">Georgia-Pacific Corp.</span> executive who directs the survey, said in an interview. "July is going to be a very critical month because if we're going to take a huge hit from $140-per-barrel oil, it's probably going to come in July."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Commerce Department's construction spending figure dropped 0.4% in May, and 6% from a year ago, reflecting the continuing woes of the housing industry. It was the 11th such monthly decline in the last year and brought construction spending to $1.085 trillion at a seasonally adjusted yearly rate. Nonresidential construction spending slowed but stayed in positive territory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patrick Newport, U.S. economist for Global Insight, said in a note to clients that nonresidential construction is likely to contract later this year as the economic slowdown and tighter credit take an increasingly heavy toll.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply managers' index showed that new orders, a key barometer of future activity, declined, while employment fell to its lowest level in five years. Another worrisome sign: The overall increase in manufacturing occurred in part because of a sudden rise in inventories after more than two years of declines. That could suggest a buildup of goods in the face of a dropping consumer demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are many shocks that are still playing out and hitting the economy," Michelle Meyer, a <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> economist, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, slow but uncertain growth appears to continue as exports in industries from paper products to electronics buoy an otherwise slumping economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing-related industries such as wood products continue to contract, and any sharp decline in consumer demand because of high prices and general unease could drag the economy into a recession later this year. "It looks like the degree of weakness in the domestic economy may be more than offsetting the export strength," said Andrew Tilton, a senior economist for <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs.</span></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sung Won Sohn, an economics professor at California State University, said of Tuesday's manufacturing report, "we're grabbing any good news we can get at the moment." Still, he said, it's "too early to conclude that we are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel."</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Commercial Loans: Behind the Next Hit</span>
</div><div class="author">By Jennifer S. Forsyth </div><div>496 words</div><div>2 July 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C10</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far most of the losses in the housing crisis have been from homeowners defaulting on their mortgages. But there is another wave of pain about to hit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers increasingly are falling behind on loan payments, especially those who borrowed to finance acquisitions of land and construction of houses and condominiums. This has caused some confusion because regulators and banks typically lump these in with commercial real-estate loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here, then, is a primer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Question: What is a commercial real-estate loan?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Answer: When the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</span> refers to commercial-real-estate loans, it includes the traditional mortgages that a borrower takes on when buying an office building or shopping center. But also under the commercial-real-estate umbrella are construction loans, land development and other land loans even if these involve residential construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus, a developer's construction loan to build a $300 million office tower is considered a commercial-real-estate loan, but so, too, is a loan to a small home builder. That home builder might borrow from his community bank to buy empty land, to put in new sewer lines in a subdivision or to build a new three-bedroom house -- all categorized as commercial-real-estate loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: How big is the commercial-real-estate exposure for banks?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: In a word, huge. The FDIC tallied the total amount of outstanding commercial loans in the first quarter of 2008 at $1.97 trillion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: When regulators say commercial loans could cripple banks, which loans do they mean?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: Most of the pain -- so far, at least -- is related to residential overbuilding and moribund demand, causing builders to default on construction loans for single-family housing and condominiums. Land once planned for housing has plummeted in value and builders are still completing houses, only to see no buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider these numbers: U.S. banks had $264.4 billion in outstanding construction loans for single-family houses at the end of the first quarter of 2008 and an additional $280.8 billion for loans to build commercial properties such as office buildings. Yet, the delinquency rate was for 10.8% for the housing loans, compared with 3.6% to build commercial structures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: Are single-family construction loans the worst-performing such loans?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: No. Construction loans for condominiums earned that dubious distinction, although they make up a much smaller piece of the pie with $41.3 billion in loans outstanding. Condo loans' rate of delinquency (at least 30 or more days past due) was 13.6% in the first quarter of 2008, according to Foresight Analytics. And experts predict that percentage will rise considerably for the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: Is there any good news here?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: Yes, the delinquency rate for nonconstruction mortgages on traditional commercial property -- such as office buildings, hotels and strip centers -- remains near historic lows.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Shara Tibken and John Spence </div><div>552 words</div><div>28 June 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B5</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">KB Home</span> reported a wider second-quarter loss because of a weakening housing market and said the glut of unsold homes continues to pile up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Despite substantially lower home prices, relatively low interest rates and an abundance of choices, potential new-home buyers remain reluctant to purchase a home," Chief Executive Jeffrey Mezger said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Los Angeles company said results in the quarter ended May 31 included write-downs of $201.1 million, down from $223.9 million in the first quarter and $308.2 million a year ago. But the latest quarter also included $98.9 million from writing down the value of deferred-tax assets, which can be used to offset future profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales fell 55% to $639.1 million, less than the average estimate of $691.3 million among analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> fell 41 cents, or 2.3%, to $17.72 as of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">KB Home</span> said it delivered 41% fewer homes in the May quarter compared with a year earlier, while average selling prices dropped 17% to $226,000. Net orders for new homes tumbled 42%, although the cancellation rate improved to 27% in the second quarter from 53% in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Persistently poor demand for new homes during the second quarter amplified pricing pressures and diminished asset values in many of our served markets," said Mr. Mezger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the plus side, <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> reported positive cash flow from operations in the first half of 2008 and expects the trend will continue through the end of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like other builders, <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> has been struggling to slash its backlog during the housing bust and said it has significantly reduced inventory and debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest results "indicated continued challenging conditions for the company," <span class="companylink">Soleil Securities Group</span>'s Anna Torma wrote to clients. She has a "hold" rating on <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Highlighting their desperation to sell houses, builders have been bringing back the gimmicks: mortgage rates that start low, help with down payments and zero out-of-pocket expenses. Along with offering zero-down deals, the fiscal second quarter was the first full quarter <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> offered price protection, promising contracted buyers a reduced price if the price tag for comparable homes is trimmed before closing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">KB Home</span> has been aggressively reducing its supply of land and had $1.31 billion in cash on its balance sheet, and it is focusing on marketing to first-time home buyers and building smaller, lower-cost houses to increase sales amid the downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While other builders are simplifying homes to shave costs, <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> continues to tout its design studios, which offer plenty of carpet, counter and door choices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Even with pressures on affordability, our studio sales remain strong, reinforcing that choice is a key driver for the consumer in making the home-building decision," Dom Cecere, executive vice president and chief financial officer, said at a conference last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builder <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp.</span>, reported a quarterly loss Thursday and predicted further deterioration in the housing market as the year wears on.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp;Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four-week average for initial jobless claims in the U.S. was 378,250 for the week that ended June 21. An Economy &amp;Politics page article in the June 27-29 edition incorrectly gave the number as 378,350. Also, construction spending in April in the U.S. was initially estimated by the government at $1.12 trillion at an annual rate. A Leading the News page article June 3 incorrectly said the initial estimate was $1.12 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(WSJA July 4, 2008)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. economy grew slightly more in the first quarter than previously estimated, and home sales rose in May, but concerns are rising about potential threats to growth in coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For the balance of this year, it looks like the economy is trapped in a subpar growth pace but not a recession," said Stephen Stanley, chief economist with RBS Greenwich Capital in Stamford, Connecticut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department said U.S. gross domestic product rose at an annual rate of 1% during the first three months of the year, up from its previous estimate of 0.9%. The economy grew at a 0.6% pace in the final quarter of last year. Stronger consumer spending and export growth helped boost growth in the first quarter; inflation rates also were revised higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding energy and food -- a gauge of inflation watched closely by the U.S. Federal Reserve -- rose at a 2.3% pace, above the 1.5%-to-2% range that the Fed considers price stability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned houses, meanwhile, rose 2% last month after declining in the previous two months, according to the National Association of Realtors. Still, the sales pace of existing homes, which make up about 85% of the U.S. market, is down about 16% from May 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing single-family homes rose 1.6% last month to a 4.4 million rate but are down about 15% from a year earlier. The monthly rise was likely fueled by declining prices; the median single-family home price last month was $206,700, 6.8% lower than in May 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On GDP, analysts expect a similar performance for the April-through-June period, as government economic-stimulus checks provide some relief to consumers. Rising exports also continue to buoy growth, as foreign demand for U.S. goods remains strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of concern now is how the economy will fare later this year and early next year, as the impact of the stimulus checks fades. U.S. consumer confidence plummeted this month as a result of labor-market worries and soaring prices for oil, fuel and other commodities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, newly filed claims for unemployment benefits last week totaled 384,000, after seasonal adjustment, unchanged from the week before, the Labor Department said. The four-week average, which smooths out weekly volatility, rose by 2,250 to 378,350 last week -- its highest level since Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of Americans who continue to claim unemployment benefits rose by 82,000 in the week ended June 14, to 3.14 million. As the number of unemployed keeps rising, continuing claims have been above the three million level for the past nine weeks.</p>

</div><div class="author">By John Spence and Dawn Wotapka </div><div>665 words</div><div>27 June 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lennar Corp.</span>'s fiscal second-quarter loss narrowed amid sharply lower write-downs, yet the stock fell after the home builder said it expects the housing market to worsen as the year wears on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing market has continued to deteriorate throughout the first half of 2008," Chief Executive Stuart Miller said on a conference call. "I am asked regularly as to whether or not we are at the bottom, and I feel overall that we are not there yet."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lennar shares fell $1.23, or 8.4%, to $13.34 as of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Miami company said its quarterly deliveries of homes dropped 60%, new orders were down 45%, and the cancellation rate was 22%. The median sales price in May fell 6.3% to $208,600 from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller said Lennar is making progress on reducing inventory and expenses, and the company ended the second quarter with about $880 million in cash and no borrowings outstanding under its credit facility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company shaved unsold completed inventory by 70% from a year earlier and by 47% from the prior quarter. Selling, general and administrative costs declined 60% from a year earlier amid layoffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Lennar is well positioned given management's continued focus on converting inventory to cash and maintaining its strong balance-sheet position," <span class="companylink">Soleil Securities Group</span> analysts led by Anna Torma wrote in a report Thursday. She reiterated her "buy" rating on Lennar shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lennar's results "show further evidence that the housing market has not yet found a bottom," <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> analysts said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lennar has been hit for months by slow sales, plummeting prices and other pains from the worst housing market slump in decades. <span class="companylink">KB Home</span>, which reports quarterly results Friday, has had similar troubles as builders battle double-digit cancellation rates and stubbornly high inventory as buyers wary of falling prices walk away from signed contracts. To sell homes, builders are being forced to discount prices and offer incentives that cut into already stressed gross margins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data released Tuesday by the Conference Board reveal how wary potential home buyers across the U.S. have become: Just 2.2% of the business-research firm's respondents said they intend to buy a home in the next six months, a 25-year low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday, the Commerce Department said new-home sales fell 2.5% in May to a seasonally adjusted rate of 512,000 -- a 40.3% drop from May 2007. That came a day after <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span> said its Case-Shiller home-price index showed prices of single-family homes in 20 major cities dropped 15.3% in April from the year before, and have returned to 2004 levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, which oversees Fannie Mae and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and tracks prices of homes purchased with their mortgages, said home prices slipped 4.6% in April from the previous year, the biggest decline since its tracking began in 1991.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During its earnings conference call, Lennar also worked to soothe investors spooked by its joint ventures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industry watchers have long feared those ventures, because the debt associated with them doesn't appear on balance sheets. Lennar's joint-venture investments are by far the industry's highest, according to <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan.</span> Lennar executives said the company has whittled its count from 270 to 163.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the total, 57 have recourse debt and 31 have nonrecourse debt, which buffers the borrower from losing anything other than collateral. Another 75 carry no debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller also tried to reassure investors about its partnership in LandSource Communities Development LLC, which owns thousands of acres in California and recently filed for bankruptcy. "The potential impact to the company is not material," he said during the call.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kelly Evans </div><div>442 words</div><div>26 June 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Asia</div><div>AWSJ</div><div>12</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2008 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for big-ticket U.S. manufactured goods were flat in May, and sales of new homes slumped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Commerce Department said orders for manufactured durable goods -- equipment, cars and machinery intended to last three years or more -- were essentially unchanged in May from the month before at $213.6 billion. April's 0.6% decline was revised to a larger 1% drop from the month before. Orders were down 0.2% in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A flat number after two consecutive monthly declines is hardly a sign of vibrant growth," said <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span> economist Tim Quinlan. "Businesses are scaling back."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new single-family homes in May fell 2.5% from the month before to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 512,000 -- a 40.3% decline from May 2007. Sales were weakest in the Northeast and West and better in the Midwest and South. Inventories of unsold homes grew to a 10.9 months' supply at the current sales pace from a 10.7 months' supply in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"None of this bodes well for near-term conditions," said Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist at MFR Inc. in New York, "and prices will need to fall further to help stimulate demand." The median sales price of a home last month was $231,000, according to the report, a 5.7% drop from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales have been particularly hard-hit during the housing bust, thanks to the frenzy of building activity during the housing boom, which resulted in a huge oversupply of homes. The numbers for May's existing-home sales, which make up about 85% of the total market, will be released Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers and companies continue to battle eroding economic conditions and soaring fuel and commodity prices. Orders for manufactured goods last month were buoyed in part by volatile aircraft and defense orders, while underlying demand continues to soften.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Excluding aircraft and other transportation, durable goods orders fell 0.9% in May from the month before. A key gauge of future business spending -- orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft -- dropped 0.8% last month after posting a 3.1% gain in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall shipments of durable goods fell 1.1% last month after a 1.8% decline in April, as auto shipments and orders remained especially weak, a troubling sign for economic growth. Inventories rose 0.4%, possibly reflecting an unwanted buildup of merchandise as sales weaken, said Mr. Shapiro.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing slump, already shaping up to be the worst in a generation, still hasn't run its full course, according to Harvard University's annual report on housing, released Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if job losses accelerate in coming months, that could push any recovery even further out, said Nicolas P. Retsinas, director of Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies. Job losses, he said, could be "the last shoe to drop, but a pretty heavy shoe."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The center releases its "State of the Nation's Housing" report each year and the 2008 edition gave a grim prognosis for housing markets throughout the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local markets are dealing with drops in housing starts, new-home sales and existing-home sales -- corrections that are rivaling the deepest slowdowns since the World War II era, the center reported. On top of that, the fall in home prices and the rise in mortgage defaults are the worst on record since the 1960s and 1970s. All this adds up to a downturn that is "the most severe that we have seen," said Mr. Retsinas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Retsinas said that historically, housing markets usually recover after an economic recession and a mix of falling mortgage rates and dropping home prices. This housing downturn will likely take longer to rebound, he said, because of the high volume of foreclosures and the constraints in the credit markets.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kelly Evans </div><div>590 words</div><div>18 June 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soaring prices coupled with a slowdown in manufacturing and housing activity highlight the dilemma faced by the Federal Reserve as it weighs whether inflation or recession poses the bigger threat to the U.S. economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data released by the Labor Department on Tuesday show companies are facing rising costs for an array of supplies, which may prompt them to increase prices on their products in the months ahead. The producer-price index rose 1.4% in May from the month before, partly reflecting a surge in crude-oil prices that pushed gasoline prices up 9.3%. Prices for other commodities also jumped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index for core prices, which excludes energy and food, rose by a more muted 0.2% in May from the month before, but was up 3% from a year earlier, the biggest jump on a yearly basis since 1991.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inflation report "makes life a little bit more difficult for the Fed," said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist with Merk Investments, based in Palo Alto, Calif. The data on prices suggest the Fed "should raise rates, but they probably won't" because of continued strong concerns about the threats to economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the Commerce Department said construction of new homes dropped 3.3% in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 975,000. Housing starts were down 32% from a year earlier. Permits for new-home construction, a gauge of future building activity, dropped 1.3% in May to an annual rate of 969,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, output at factories and other industries dropped in May for the second month in a row, the Federal Reserve reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. economy grew at a slight 0.9% annual rate in the first three months of this year and will likely turn in a similar performance for the April-through-June period. Recessions typically encompass two consecutive quarters of negative gross-domestic-product growth, but the National Bureau of Economic Research, the nonprofit group that determines when recessions begin and end, could still decide that a recession began during the first half of this year, based on indicators such as employment and industrial output. For example, the last recession, in 2001, had two quarters of negative GDP growth but they were not consecutive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial production was down 0.2% in May after falling 0.7% in April. Activity fell 0.1% from a year earlier, the first year-over-year decline since the 2001 recession. Industry capacity use -- which is used to gauge mounting activity and inflationary pressures -- dropped to 79.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop in activity in sectors that are usually boosted by low interest rates suggests that, despite growing concerns about inflation, the Fed is unlikely to change rates at its policy meeting next Tuesday and Wednesday. Currently, the target for the Fed's benchmark federal-funds rate -- the rate at which banks lend each other funds over night -- is 2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported that the U.S. current-account deficit, which reflects international trade in goods and services as well as investment income flows, widened by $9.2 billion during the first quarter to $176.4 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deficit has narrowed since the beginning of last year, when it was $196.9 billion. That reflects a weak dollar that makes U.S. assets cheaper and increasing foreign buying. The deficit is now running at about 5% of gross domestic product.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sluggish housing markets are filled with listings that are lingering on the market, prompting many home sellers to ponder a price cut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A seller's reality check may come after the listing produces very few showings or a prospective buyer is lost to a competing -- and lower-priced -- home down the block.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a very price-driven market," says Mike Golden, co-founder and co-principal of @properties, a Chicago-based real-estate brokerage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No longer are buyers letting their emotions interfere when they decide to buy a home -- they're looking for deals, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many sellers whose homes are sitting on the market without a buyer in sight had unrealistic expectations from the start, real-estate agents say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We still have sellers who are in denial of the market and don't want to price properties where they need to," says Susan Jacobs, broker-owner of an Assist-2-Sell brokerage in Manassas, Va. Her clients are often shocked to learn how much prices have fallen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How can sellers tell if their homes are overpriced? Look for the following signs:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1) Not enough showings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A home is likely overpriced if it doesn't get any showings in the first couple of weeks it's on the market, Ms. Jacobs says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even more proof a price cut is needed: people are interested enough to take information from brochure boxes in front of the home, and there have been a substantial number of hits on its Web site listings, but buyers still aren't scheduling showings, she adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A real-estate agent will often have access to data on how many hits an Internet listing gets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a home doesn't make a buyer's "showing cut," and buyers don't think it's worth the time, hassle or gasoline to schedule a visit, it's likely overpriced, says Dave Crumby, broker-owner of another Assist-2-Sell brokerage, in Tempe, Ariz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you can't get people into your home, it's highly unlikely that it will sell," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2) Some showings, but no contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the number of showings isn't a problem, yet there still have been no offers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you're getting showings but not getting a contract, that means you're still not quite low enough," Ms. Jacobs says. "You're close, but there's so much competition out there."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider this guideline from Becky Flores, a real-estate agent at a San Antonio-based Keller Williams brokerage: "Ten showings and no offer or two weeks with no showings, you are probably overpriced for the current market. This is true especially in this very competitive market," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3) Similar homes are now selling for less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In markets where the median price is falling, it's important to regularly monitor what homes are selling for, Mr. Golden says. Real-estate agents should provide clients with up-to-date information on the market to determine whether the home is still priced correctly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Historical data isn't quite so powerful anymore. You have to look at what is selling now, and what it is selling for," Mr. Golden adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Phoenix, there's a big difference between the average price for active listings and the average price for pending sales, Mr. Crumby says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monitor pending sales daily, and make sure your home is competing well with the homes that buyers are taking action on, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4) Repeated negative feedback.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If buyers who do walk through the home have the same negative reactions to it, that could be another red flag that the price needs to be dropped, Ms. Jacobs says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyer feedback, collected from a real-estate agent, may reveal that other houses in the same price range have updated kitchens or bathrooms and the home in question hasn't kept up with the times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To address the disparity, sellers can either remodel or cut the price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You can sell anything anywhere. If the price is right it will sell," Ms. Jacobs says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5) You've cut the price, but not enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a price cut is in order, don't cut by small increments. Several smaller decreases could make a seller look desperate, but a larger decrease will generate more interest, Ms. Flores says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A $2,000 price reduction is nothing in the grand scheme of things. Even on a $100,000 house, I'd lower by $5,000 at least, if it isn't moving," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Your first three weeks are critical. You'll have your most showings with the most potential, qualified buyers -- those that are out there waiting for something that matches their needs to come on the market," Ms. Flores says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Don't blow it by overpricing."</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>289 words</div><div>5 June 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of homes available for sale in major metropolitan areas declined slightly in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total listings of homes in 29 metro areas at the end of May edged down 0.3% from a month earlier, according to figures compiled by ZipRealty Inc., a real-estate brokerage firm based in Emeryville, Calif. The data cover listings of single-family homes, condos and town houses on local multiple-listing services in those areas, where Zip operates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory was up about 0.3% from May 2007 in 18 metro areas for which Zip has comparable year-earlier data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers are the latest sign that the supply of homes on the market is leveling off. But the supply remains ample. The National Association of Realtors recently said the number of single-family homes on the market in April was enough to last 10.7 months at the current sales rate. That was the highest since 1985. In the first half of this decade, when house prices were soaring, the supply typically was four to five months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures from Zip and the Realtors probably understate the supply of homes because not all foreclosed properties that lenders are trying to sell are listed on multiple-listing services, said Thomas Lawler, a housing economist in Leesburg, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders and investors in mortgages owned 660,000 foreclosed homes in April, up from 493,000 in January and 231,000 in January 2007, according to an estimate from First American CoreLogic. The April total works out to about one in seven previously occupied homes listed for sale nationwide.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. manufacturing activity contracted again in May, but just barely, as exports continued to keep the sector afloat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management said its index of manufacturing activity rose to 49.6 in May from 48.6 in April. It was the fourth consecutive month that the index was below 50; readings below 50 signal a contraction in overall activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report showed construction spending in April dropped by a seasonally adjusted 0.4% from the previous month, to $1.12 billion. Spending on private nonresidential construction, which includes hotels and office buildings, rose 1.6%, partly offsetting the slump in residential construction, which declined 2.3% in April and is down 21% from a year earlier, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the ISM report, exports continued to increase, extending a five-and-a-half-year trend that is helping offset slowing U.S. demand, and production expanded. New orders rose and imports grew slightly. But high commodity costs pushed prices to a four-year high, and employment and inventories contracted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Were it not for the weak dollar," which makes prices of U.S. goods cheaper abroad and stimulates export orders, "I really do believe we'd be looking at far lower readings," said Norbert Ore, a <span class="companylink">Georgia-Pacific Corp.</span> executive who directs the survey. He noted that 80% of ISM member companies are exporters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The employment component of the ISM report rose in May, but was still below 50.</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>548 words</div><div>3 June 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Asia</div><div>AWSJ</div><div>12</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2008 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of foreclosed homes in the U.S. owned by lenders continues to rise despite signs that they are increasingly willing to slash prices to sell those properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders and investors in mortgages owned about 660,000 foreclosed homes in April, up from 493,000 in January and 231,000 in January 2007, according to First American CoreLogic, a research firm that collects data from lenders and county clerks. The April total works out to about one in seven previously occupied homes available for sale nationwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A surge in defaults has increased the inventory of bank-owned homes, known in the trade as REO, for "real estate owned." By cutting prices, lenders have managed to increase sales of such homes sharply in recent months in some cities hit hard by foreclosures, including Las Vegas, Detroit and Sacramento, California, local real-estate brokers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With home prices falling, "holding the assets means further losses," said Mark Fleming, chief economist for First American CoreLogic. Some lenders now are cutting prices as often as every 20 days on homes that aren't selling, said David McCarthy, chief executive officer of Integrated Asset Services LLC, a company that helps banks value and sell REO homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But lenders haven't yet managed to catch up with the inflow of foreclosed homes. Mark Zandi, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com, forecasts that the inventory of REO homes won't peak before the end of 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In dollar terms, foreclosed one- to four-family homes owned by lenders whose deposits are insured by the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</span> more than doubled to $8.56 billion at the end of the first quarter from $3.59 billion a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The REO glut is weighing on house prices in many areas, as banks tend to cut prices faster than other sellers. A new set of local home-price indexes, to be introduced this week by Integrated Asset Services, shows that the median price of homes sold in Riverside County, California, in April was down about 29% from a year earlier. The median price fell about 13% in Clark County, Nevada, which includes Las Vegas, and 12% in Arizona's Maricopa and Pima counties. Median-price comparisons can be skewed by shifts in the proportions of high- and lower-priced homes sold from one year to the next but provide a broad indication of market trends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To avoid or at least delay losses, many lenders are trying to avert foreclosures by easing loan terms or giving struggling borrowers more time to catch up. Hope Now, an alliance of mortgage companies and investors, said last week that mortgage companies completed loan workouts for 183,000 households in April, up from 160,000 in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, long-term interest rates rose last week, marking another potential drag on the housing market. The average rate on 30-year fixed rate loans eligible for sale to government-sponsored investors Fannie Mae and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> was 6.17%, up from 6.02% a week earlier, according to HSH Associates, a financial publisher.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp;Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four-week average for initial jobless claims was 378,250 for the week that ended June 21. A U.S. News article Friday incorrectly gave the number as 378,350. Also, construction spending in April was initially estimated by the government at $1.12 trillion at an annual rate. A U.S. News article June 3 incorrectly said the initial estimate was $1.12 billion.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. manufacturing activity contracted slightly in May, as exports kept the sector afloat and prices surged, but performed better than many economists had expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management said its index of manufacturing activity rose to 49.6 in May from 48.6 in April. It was the fourth consecutive month that the index was below 50; readings below 50 signal a contraction in overall activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, the report bolstered other recent data suggesting the economy is stagnant but not collapsing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report showed construction spending in April dropped by a seasonally adjusted 0.4% from the previous month, to $1.12 billion. Spending on private nonresidential construction, which includes hotels and office buildings, rose 1.6%, partly offsetting the slump in residential construction, which declined 2.3% in April and is down 21% from a year earlier, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the ISM report, exports continued to increase, extending a five-and-a-half-year trend that is helping offset slowing U.S. demand, and production expanded. New orders rose and imports grew slightly. But high commodity costs pushed prices to a four-year high, and employment and inventories contracted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Were it not for the weak dollar," which makes prices of U.S. goods cheaper abroad and stimulates export orders, "I really do believe we'd be looking at far lower readings," said Norbert Ore, a <span class="companylink">Georgia-Pacific Corp.</span> executive who directs the survey. He noted that 80% of ISM member companies are exporters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weak dollar also is contributing to the run-up in oil prices. Companies that have been trying to increase productivity or cut costs are running out of options, but are worried about raising prices, out of fear of losing customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Respondents to the ISM survey noted prices are "skyrocketing" and posing "major hurdles." The prices component of the ISM survey jumped to 87 in May from 84.5 in April, and Mr. Ore noted that doesn't yet capture the full impact of rising oil prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, <span class="companylink">Dow Chemical Co.</span>, one of the largest chemical manufacturers in the world, provided a glimpse of what may be ahead in announcing it is raising prices on products by as much as 20% to offset "staggering" energy costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is far from clear, though, that consumers will accept price increases. "It is increasingly difficult to pass on commodity cost increases in a generally weak U.S. economy," said Daniel J. Meckstroth, chief economist for the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, a manufacturing trade group based in Arlington, Va. "This dynamic will lead to shrinking profit margins," he warned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The employment component of the ISM report rose in May, but was still below 50. Friday, the government will release the May employment report, which will provide information on whether and how much the labor market is deteriorating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other components of the ISM showed little change. Inventories of manufacturers and their customers continued to shrink. Imports grew slightly. The backlog of orders dropped to 46 from 51.5, a sign of weakness ahead that firms hope will be offset by the growth in new orders last month.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Offers Manhattan Loft</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CNN anchor Soledad O'Brien has put her downtown Manhattan loft up for sale for $4.6 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The former "American Morning" co-host says she's shopping for a home that's a shorter walk to school for her kids and is larger: "[I] had no idea I was having twins when we bought the place. Quite a surprise."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 41-year-old anchor has four young children with her husband, Brad Raymond, an investment banker, and designed the roughly 4,000-square-foot co-operative apartment to be child-friendly. The seven-room, full-floor apartment, with a custom open kitchen, is in Chelsea and has a 42-foot-long living room, 11-foot-high ceilings and a double home office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. O'Brien and her husband bought the apartment four years ago -- she declined to give the price -- and completely renovated. Mary Beth Flynn and Russell Miller, of Brown Harris Stevens, have the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. O'Brien now reports on the presidential election and is at work on a six-hour documentary on the state of blacks in America.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Widow Sells, Cuts Price</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The widow of best-selling author Sidney Sheldon, Alexandra, has sold one of the Palm Springs, Calif., properties she listed earlier this year and cut the price of the others by 30%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Old Las Palmas section, a midcentury modern, four-bedroom home known as the "playhouse" and used for entertaining sold for $1.425 million, slightly less than its asking price, to a pair of enthusiasts of the style. The 1954 house has an indoor pool and a miniature golf course. The buyers plan restorations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Sheldon is now asking $2 million for the adjacent main house -- a seven-bedroom 1959 single-story home on 0.62 acre, where Mr. Sheldon did much of his writing -- and $2.3 million for a guest house. Earlier, she'd listed both those houses together for $6.5 million. A second guest house, across the street, now sells for $3 million, down 25% from its original asking price of $4 million. That five-bedroom home on 0.8 acre has a pool and gym.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Sheldon cut the prices because she's now a motivated seller, according to listing agent Scott Palermo, of <span class="companylink">Prudential California Realty</span>'s Estates division, who shares the Sheldon listings with Prudential's Jim Sanak and Brook Ashley. Lisa Casey of Greater Palm Springs Realty represented the buyers. The novels of Mr. Sheldon, who died last year, include "The Other Side of Midnight."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Philanthropist Lois Pope, widow of National Enquirer founder Generoso Pope Jr., is asking $36.5 million for her ranch in Colorado.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 12,800-square-foot European-chateau-style house, with a stone exterior, was built in 2001 on 200 acres in Snowmass, near Aspen. There are six bedrooms, two elevators and a gym. The property is next to a 200-acre ranch bought for $36 million last month by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich. That contemporary-style house is roughly the same size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Mr. Pope's death in 1988, the tabloid and its sister Weekly World News were sold for more than $400 million. Ms. Pope used her share of proceeds to establish two foundations to help the needy. In 1996, she gave $10 million to the University of Miami for neurological research. Joshua Saslove of Joshua &amp;Co. in Aspen has the listing.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Donna Kardos and Dan Molinski </div><div>697 words</div><div>28 May 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home-price indexes, a closely watched gauge of U.S. home prices, indicated that prices fell further in the first quarter as the subprime-loan meltdown continued to weigh on the sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller indexes showed that home prices across the country fell 14.1% in the quarter from a year earlier, representing the largest drop in the indexes' 20-year history. From the fourth quarter, prices fell 6.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The steep downturn in residential real estate continues," said David M. Blitzer, chairman of the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span> index committee. "There are very few silver linings that one can see in the data. Most of the nation appears to remain on a downward path."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, new-home sales rose in April but failed to meet expectations as the government revised lower the level of demand for the previous month. Sales of single-family homes increased by 3.3% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 526,000, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another report, the Conference Board said consumer confidence weakened this month more than expected. May was the fifth straight month of decline. Consumers indicated that their present situation and the outlook were both bleak. The May confidence index stood at 57.2, down from a slightly revised 62.8 in April and lower than economists' expectations for a reading of 60.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the Case-Shiller indexes, released by ratings firm <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span>, home prices in 10 major metropolitan areas fell 15.3% in March from a year earlier and 2.4% from February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 20 major metropolitan areas, home prices dropped 14.4% from a year earlier and 2.2% from February. Charlotte, North Carolina, and Dallas managed to avoid March-over-February drops in prices, while Las Vegas was the weakest market, posting a 26% drop in March from the previous year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to a separate measure released last week by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, home prices fell an average of 1.7% nationwide in the first quarter from the final three months of 2007. The decline was the largest in the index's 17-year history. That index differs from the Case-Shiller indexes in several ways; notably, Ofheo data exclude homes with jumbo mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, the Commerce Department offered the latest sign that the struggling U.S. housing market may hold back economic growth for much of the year. While home construction unexpectedly jumped 2.5% in April following months of bad weather that held back many builders, permits declined 8.9% from March to an annual rate of 1.43 million, marking the largest percentage drop since a 24% tumble in February 1990.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing permits are now down 41% from their 2005 peak. Permits, which are down 28% from a year ago, predict the market's direction better than housing starts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the National Association of Home Builders said earlier this month that home builders' confidence had fallen substantially, to match the lowest point in the latest economic cycle. The meltdown in subprime loans is expected to continue weighing on the sector, and high inventories will need to be worked off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Year over year, new-home sales in April were 42% lower than in April 2007. March new-home sales fell 11% to an annual rate to 509,000; originally, the government said March sales dropped by 8.5% to 526,000. Economists had forecast an April sales rate of 533,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a new home increased by 1.5% to $246,100 in April from $242,500 a year earlier. The average price of a new home climbed by 3% to $321,000 from $311,700 a year earlier. In March, the median price was $225,500 and the average was $291,500. The increase in prices may be positive for future sales; declining prices have been stopping consumers from buying homes as they wait for still-lower prices.</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>517 words</div><div>27 May 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>14</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales are rising in some U.S. metropolitan areas where lenders have slashed prices on foreclosed properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Generally, home sales remain weak. The National Association of Realtors reported last week that sales of previously occupied homes in April were down about 18% from the already depressed year-earlier level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But sales are up sharply in some of the areas hit hardest by foreclosures and falling prices. They include Las Vegas; Sacramento, California; Fort Myers, Florida; and inner-city Detroit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though Americans remain wary of further drops in housing prices, the data from these areas show that some buyers are trolling for bargains. Sellers "have moved into the acceptance mode" and are pricing homes more realistically, says Thomas Lawler, a housing economist. "I think it is the first stage of good news for the market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders' inventory of foreclosed homes has steadily increased in the past couple of years and is believed to total around half a million homes. Many lenders initially were slow to slash prices, partly because they hoped to avoid huge losses. But more lenders have been capitulating as it becomes clear that delays often merely result in lower proceeds and higher costs for taxes, insurance and upkeep.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That doesn't mean housing is poised for a quick recovery. In much of the U.S., there is still a huge glut of homes for sale, and foreclosures continue to dump more property on the market. The Realtors reported that the number of single-family homes on the market in April was enough to last 10.7 months at the current sales rate, the highest since 1985. During the housing boom of the first half of this decade, the supply typically was four to five months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the first four months of this year, home sales in Detroit, excluding suburbs, totaled 3,360, up 48% from a year earlier, according to the Michigan Association of Realtors. The average price dropped 56% to just $20,514. That average is so low because many of the sales involve decrepit homes in neighborhoods with few jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the recent sales in Detroit involve investors buying foreclosed homes, says Carl Williams, president of the local association of Realtors. The homes are selling, he says, because "the prices are dirt cheap."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of "normal" homes, those that haven't been foreclosed, remain very slow, Mr. Williams says. Still, he sees it as a good sign that lenders are finding buyers for the foreclosed homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In California's Sacramento County, sales of single-family homes totaled 1,669 in April, up 41% from a year earlier, according to <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> Information Systems, a research firm. The median sales price was $226,250, down 34%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alan Wagner, president of the Sacramento Association of Realtors, says the rise reflects more aggressive pricing by lenders. Some homes that sold for more than $400,000 a couple years ago now go for $225,000 to $260,000, Mr. Wagner says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans' love affair with real estate may be cooling, but -- thanks to falling home prices and the weak dollar -- attention is heating up from another group of suitors: foreign investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign buyers have long looked to certain U.S. markets, such as high-end properties in Manhattan or South Beach Miami, as investment opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, however, real-estate professionals report increased international interest in a much larger range of properties, from $60,000 single-family homes in South Florida's inland neighborhoods to $1 million waterfront villas located just miles from the Canadian border in Washington State.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost one in five, or 18%, realtors surveyed by the National Association of Realtors last year said they sold homes to international clients between April 2006 and April 2007. More recent data aren't yet available, but according to anecdotal evidence, those numbers continue to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There definitely is more interest in U.S. properties, no question about it," says Mark Partin, president of Trailridge Property Corp., of Toronto, which brokers deals between U.S. developers and Canadian investors interested in buying residential properties in "bulk."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many foreign buyers, property in the U.S. is cheap. Foreign buyers also seem more optimistic about the long-term health of the U.S. market, says David Michonski, a certified international property specialist and chief executive of Coldwell Banker Hunt Kennedy in New York. "The foreign buyer has an unbridled confidence in the U.S. market that is lacking in the domestic purchaser today," he notes.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes edged lower in April as the number of unsold homes surged and prices fell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales activity declined 1% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.89 million units, the National Association of Realtors said. The median price of a previously owned home was $202,300 in April, down 8% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices are expected to continue falling as inventories rise. The number of homes available for sale jumped 10.5% in April to 4.55 million units. That represents a supply of 11.2 months at the current sales pace.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sudeep Reddy </div><div>413 words</div><div>23 May 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are falling faster as the economy slows and turmoil in the mortgage markets continues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices fell an average of 1.7% nationwide in the first quarter from the final three months of 2007, according to the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight. The decline was the largest in the index's 17-year history. The government index, which is seasonally adjusted and based on data for home purchases, had dropped 1.4% in the prior quarter. Compared with a year earlier, home prices dropped 3.1% in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price drops, which occurred in 43 states, "spell further erosion in home-equity levels and potentially more trouble for mortgage markets," said the agency's director, James Lockhart, who added that the declines may help potential home buyers. Areas that had the biggest price gains over the past decade now are experiencing the sharpest declines. Prices in California and Nevada declined more than 8% from the prior quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate monthly index showed that prices fell 0.4% in March compared with February, and 3.7% from April 2007, when the index hit its highest point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight index tracks sales of single-family houses purchased with mortgages guaranteed by home-loan giants Fannie Mae and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac.</span> (Executives of Fannie Mae and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> told Congress they are finally bringing down interest rates on large mortgages. Please see article on Page A5.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other nationwide indexes show steeper declines. The S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index, which includes a broader variety of mortgages and which showed a nationwide drop of 8.9% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, is set to release first-quarter figures next week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The OFHEO report shows the weakness in the housing market, but does not, in our view, fully portray the dire state of the market," <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> economist Michelle Meyer said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, initial claims for jobless benefits declined 9,000 last week to 365,000, the Labor Department said. The four-week moving average -- a measure of the underlying trend -- increased by 5,000 to 372,250, indicating a slow deterioration in the job market. Continuing unemployment claims edged up in a sign that job seekers are having a tough time finding new work.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Downtown: It's been among the safest places to hide from the housing downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much has been made of the way the nation's real-estate bust is affecting some American cities far more than others. But even within a single metro area, changes in housing prices can show wild variations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in big cities, prices in the central cores often fare the best. Far-flung suburbs -- where home building exploded in recent years -- have more typically gotten hammered. In between is a patchwork of established suburbs and city neighborhoods peripheral to downtown that can be all over the map in terms of price declines -- or even increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider the San Francisco Bay area. Overall, prices there slid 17% in the 12 months through February, the most-recent data available, and were down 8% over the first two months of 2008 alone, making it one of the worst-performing metro areas in the country, according to the S&amp;P/Case Shiller Home Price Indices. Yet prices within the city of San Francisco are up 0.3% over the first quarter of 2008, according to <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> Information Systems, a San Diego-based real-estate-data firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For today's buyers, all this means that shopping for housing bargains is increasingly complicated. The best deals may be where prices have slid the most, but such areas could easily fall a good bit more before hitting bottom. Meanwhile, you'll get few bargains if you buy a home in San Francisco or Manhattan or downtown Boston. Of course, if the housing crisis broadens, the central core areas also could see price drops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's a cheat sheet to understanding home-price patterns in some of the country's biggest metro areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Chicago</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a mixed picture in Chicago's downtown area. A flurry of condominium building has kept prices down on much new construction. At the same time, some established apartment buildings are still seeing buoyant prices, even as properties spend more time on the market. The Carlyle, a 1960s-era glass-and-concrete tower along the city's prized Gold Coast neighborhood, recorded the highest price ever -- $2.4 million -- for one of its "C"-tier units earlier this year, for example.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim Kinney, president of Rubloff Residential Properties in Chicago, says "80% to 90% of the buildings along the Gold Coast achieved a record sales price in the last year." The older buildings are often in blue-chip locations and are generally cheaper, per square foot, than new units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bargains abound in Chicago's periphery. Seven miles south of the Carlyle is Bronzeville, a gentrifying community that during the housing boom was a favorite of buyers who couldn't afford Chicago's glitzier core. Just last month, a bank that owns a foreclosed duplex in Bronzeville dropped the asking price to just $85,000, from the January listing price of $129,900. The owners who lost the property originally paid $330,000 in November 2005, about a year before the Chicago market peaked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But beware: Prices may be stagnant or worse for a long time to come. "Because of the huge inventory, it will take years to recover," says Christina Miller, a Rubloff agent, citing periphery neighborhoods such as Wicker Park, Ukrainian Village and Bucktown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chicago's desirable North Shore suburbs are, for the most part, doing well. Median prices in Evanston, Wilmette and Winnetka, all hugging Lake Michigan's shoreline, are up over the past year to varying degrees, though sales volume is down sharply, according to a Zip Code analysis by <span class="companylink">DataQuick.</span> Sellers are receiving about 89% of the list price, according to March data from the North Shore-Barrington Association of Realtors. That's down from about 95% at the peak of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In upscale Highland Park, about 25 miles north of downtown, prices are down more than 6%. But that average is being skewed by a high number of sales of low-end homes, some forced by foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- New York</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While New York's commuter market -- which includes suburban New York, New Jersey and Connecticut -- is down about 8% from its peak in mid-2006, much of Manhattan continues humming along. Neighborhoods such as SoHo, the Lower East Side, Greenwich Village, Chelsea, Murray Hill, the Upper West Side and Harlem are all up in the past year, according to <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>'s Zip Code analysis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bidding wars still happen. Toni Haber, an executive vice president at Prudential Douglas Elliman, a New York City real-estate firm, says 60 people waited in line recently at an open house to view a three-bedroom apartment in Greenwich Village. The owner had four competing offers within the week, and agreed to sell for about $2.5 million -- $300,000 over the asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the city's strength comes from the fact that few buyers were investing in properties to flip them. Moreover, many apartment buildings in New York aren't condominiums but co-ops, which impose financial demands on potential buyers far more rigorous than banks do -- which helps keep the number of foreclosures down. In addition, foreign investors have been exploiting the weak dollar by grabbing Manhattan real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One area of weakness: the Financial District in Lower Manhattan, where median prices are down, in part because of an abundance of new construction in the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those areas of Brooklyn that are close to Manhattan are also holding up well. On the periphery, places like Jamaica, Queens; parts of the Bronx; and nearby New Jersey towns such as Jersey City and Hoboken are off between 3% and 14%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Farther out, popular commuter towns like Summit and New Providence, N.J., are down at much as 16%. Pockets of suburban strength do exist, though. High-end suburbs in New York's Westchester County such as Chappaqua are up over the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Boston</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael DiMella, managing partner at Charlesgate Realty Group, recently sold a one-bedroom condo in Boston's South End district for $365,000, roughly $100,000 more than the owners originally paid in 2000 and about what they could have expected at the peak of the Boston real-estate market in late 2005. But the condo sat on the market for nearly four months before a buyer came along.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That sale typifies many parts of core Boston these days: flat to modestly higher prices but a longer time to sell. Prices in the city's core are off less than 1% over the past year, according to first-quarter data from Listing Information Network, Boston's MLS system. The real difference today is that homes are staying on the market for 111 days on average, up from 85 days in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in key neighborhoods, such as Back Bay, the South End, Fenway and the Waterfront, are all up between 3% and 10%. Beacon Hill and the North End, however, are down sharply, as much as 33%. That's partly the result of a slew of high-end properties that hit the market in 2006 and 2007 that were priced as high as $1.5 million, skewing the price data upward. Even without those sales, however, the median price would be down by double-digit amounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"No one is taking prices higher these days just to see if they can get it, like they used to," Mr. DiMella says of Boston's downtown core. "But you have to come with realistic expectations. This is a highly desirable area, and you're not going to find a steal."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearby communities are a mixed bag. Condos in suburban Brookline, one of the most desirable Zip Codes -- 02445 -- are down about 8%, while neighboring 02446 is up nearly 7%, for example. Among city neighborhoods, Dorchester is down across the board by as much as 25%, yet Jamaica Plain and West Roxbury are each up between 7% and 9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- San Francisco</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I get buyers who come in thinking they're going to get a real bargain these days because prices are down all over the country, and we just laugh," says Caroline Werboff, an agent with San Francisco real-estate firm Hill &amp;Co.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People want to live in San Francisco's urban core. Median prices around the Financial District, North Beach, Telegraph Hill and Russian Hill are up -- in some case strongly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Werboff says a Russian Hill home that sold for $7.7 million in April 2004 sold again in February for $10.3 million. A newly listed house in Pacific Heights, another core neighborhood with strong price appreciation, sold three years ago for $6 million. Ms. Werboff says that the owners "will get $10 million now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some San Francisco neighborhoods are down, particularly along the edges of the city, such as Portola, Bayview, Hunters Point and Sunset. Edward Leamer, director of the UCLA Anderson Forecast, an economic research center at the University of California Los Angeles, warns that "the housing problems won't bypass San Francisco proper. The decline will just take more time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, both closer-in and distant suburbs are weak, too, often markedly so. On the periphery, San Mateo County and high-end Marin County are doing the best, both down more than 4% between March 2007 and 2008, according to <span class="companylink">DataQuick.</span> Alameda and Contra Costa, across San Francisco Bay from the city and chockablock with anonymous tract housing, are down 18% and 27%, respectively. Bargains exist, but with so much inventory, prices aren't expected to rebound quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Santa Clara County, home to Silicon Valley, is down more than 9%, though pockets of strength exist in communities such Sunnyvale, Mountain View and Los Altos. Napa County, meanwhile, is one of the weakest in the region, with median prices off more than 20%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Los Angeles</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">L.A. is an anomaly. No real urban core exists. The area is just a sprawling string of suburbs that run together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And most of that sprawl is bathed in red ink. Median prices in communities throughout Riverside and San Bernardino counties -- the distant, inland suburbs that are at the epicenter of the region's subprime and foreclosure crises -- are down, often sharply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower-priced homes in tony Palm Springs have lost about 24%, though more-expensive homes are up slightly. Less-affluent cities such as Ontario, Chino and Rancho Cucamonga are all down between 15% and 31%. Los Angeles County, Orange County to the south and Ventura County to the north are suffering equally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only notable area of strength: high-end real estate. L.A.'s Westside, home to affluent neighborhoods such as Brentwood and Westwood, "tends to be more insulated because this is where people with money want to be," says Madison Offenhauser, regional director in Los Angeles for <span class="companylink">Keller Williams Realty.</span></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median prices in Brentwood are up 16%. The Hollywood Hills, up 26% to a median price of more than $2.1 million. Rancho Palos Verdes and the Palos Verdes peninsula, up 17%. Parts of Newport Beach, one of Orange County's poshest addresses, are up as much as 67% to $2.75 million. The coastal village of Laguna Beach is up 6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lee Ann Canaday, owner of the Canaday Group, a Laguna Beach real-estate firm, says "almost every deal I've done this year" in Laguna and Newport Beach has had multiple offers.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American consumers' sentiment about the economy dropped to a 28-year low amid surging gasoline prices, falling home prices and a weakening job market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, housing starts made an unexpected rebound in April, reflecting gains in the volatile multifamily segment for apartments and townhomes. But starts for single-family homes fell, and analysts predict continued turmoil in the housing sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Reuters/University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment in early May dropped to 59.5 from 62.6, marking its lowest point since June 1980. Consumers' views on the state of the economy showed the sharpest decline, though their expectations for the economy, which provide a signal about future spending, fell as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of consumers' gloom reflects rising gasoline prices. According to government data, the average price of a gallon of unleaded gas jumped in April by more than 30 cents to about $3.60. This month, gas prices have risen by an additional 12 cents, and are expected to continue climbing as the effects of soaring crude-oil prices reach consumers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rising prices are fueling sharp increases in inflation expectations. That could worry Federal Reserve officials who have cut their benchmark interest-rate target to 2%, from 5.25% last September, to cushion the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Michigan survey showed consumer expectations for inflation over the next year rose to 5.2% from 4.8% a month earlier, the highest since 1982. Longer-term inflation expectations -- over five to 10 years -- edged up to 3.3% from 3.2%. The increases are "suggesting that higher inflation is slowly starting to become embedded in the economy's psyche," said Paul Ashworth, an economist at Capital Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts in April increased 8.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.03 million units. The multifamily category soared 36% after a similar-size decline in March. Starts of single-family houses fell 1.7%, their 12th straight monthly drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of housing permits -- an indicator of future construction -- rose 4.9% last month to 978,000 units. But the increase came after months of declines, and few analysts believe it signals a turnaround for the market. Home-construction starts are expected to decline through much of this year to work off bloated inventories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We see no evidence, in this report or elsewhere, that the downward trend in this sector has ended," <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> analysts wrote in a note to clients.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you were thinking of buying a home, start looking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest data from the housing market shows that sellers, after months and years in denial, are finally giving in to reality and slashing prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a distance still to go. There may even be a lot to go. But the process, long delayed, is now well underway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors on Tuesday released its long-awaited report on prices from the first quarter. The price drops were startling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many of the former hot spots, from Florida to Nevada to the Californian "Inland Empire," single-family home prices plunged by 20% to nearly 30% in a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even more remarkable was how far prices had fallen just from the previous three months. In greater Las Vegas, for example, single-family home prices are down about 20% compared to the first quarter of 2007. . . and about 9% compared to last fall. In certain parts of California, the quarter-on-quarter declines are more than 10%. And there are similar pictures from Boston, Mass., to Tucson, Ariz., to, well, lots of places in Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, the decline from the previous quarter was about 5%, says the NAR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And this, ultimately, is good news. We know prices have to fall. The sooner it happens, the quicker the market can clear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We may not be at that stage known on Wall Street as "capitulation," but there is more than a whiff of it in the air.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Far too many people in the real estate market have spent far too long insisting that denial is just a river in Egypt. They refused to accept there was a bubble on the way up, and refused to admit it even on the way back down. (There's a few still out there: Last week I got an angry email from a broker who blamed the whole slump on "the media".)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is simply remarkable how slow this bubble has been to deflate. That, bluntly, is part of the problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Las Vegas area, for example, NAR data shows single home prices peaked in early 2006. Yet by the middle of last year, when everyone and their Aunt Sally already knew we were deep into the biggest housing bust since the Great Depression, prices had only been cut by around 4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No wonder sales volumes collapsed and the number of unsold homes skyrocketed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can imagine what fantasies the sellers were clinging to. "Well, two years ago this home was worth half a million bucks."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem: So what? It doesn't matter what prices were three or two years ago. We were in a bubble. Market psychologists call this "anchoring", because people anchor their expectations to the past, and it's a fallacy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just five years ago, the same home sold for $270,000 and 10 years ago just $200,000. Are those relevant anchor points too?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fact: Even though Las Vegas single family home prices are down about a quarter from their peak, NAR data shows they are still nearly 45% above their levels in early 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The picture is similar in other former hot spots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It remains to be seen how much further prices have to fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As always, quality and scarcity command a premium. But remember that a burst bubble is still a burst bubble and everything is affected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cisco Systems is a top quality technology company with real profits, but its shares still fell about 80% in the dotcom crash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no desperate rush to buy real estate. (The best way to play the real estate crash was to buy the homebuilding stocks when they bottomed out in January, as written in this column at the time.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But sellers have at least returned to the bargaining table. If you are in the market for a home, it is time, cautiously, to take a look and, maybe, see if you can play, "Let's Make A Deal."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Michael Corkery </div><div>731 words</div><div>14 May 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C21</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the latest sign that the housing market is deflating at a record pace, the National Association of Realtors said prices declined in more metropolitan areas in the first quarter than at any time in the past three decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trade group said median prices fell in about 100 metro areas -- the most since the trade group began keeping such records in 1979. It also said Tuesday that median home prices rose in 48 metro areas -- the lowest number on record. Nationally, the median home price fell to $196,300, down 7.7% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, the group's economist, said the sales-price data are being distorted by foreclosed homes and other distressed sales, which are fueling price drops in certain neighborhoods, while the lack of available so-called jumbo mortgages for high-priced homes has resulted in fewer sales in upscale neighborhoods. The upshot is that the median price for a metro area may be falling, but the prices may very sharply "neighborhood by neighborhood," Mr. Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, high-end homes are clearly under some price pressure. Luxury builder <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers Inc.</span>, which reported preliminary second-quarter results on Tuesday, said its average home price dropped 17% to $590,000 from a year earlier and was down 7% from the previous quarter, partly because of increased incentives. Toll says it is offering most incentives on homes that were built for buyers who ultimately backed out of their contracts. The builder also said its average price was lower because it sold fewer homes in high-price markets such as California and Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll says one of the biggest problems is that many buyers are putting down deposits but end up canceling because they fear they won't be able to sell their existing home. "They go to their friends and neighbors and say, 'We just bought a new home,' and everybody says 'What? Are you crazy? Prices are dropping,'" Chief Executive Robert Toll told analysts during a conference call.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were some glimpses of improvement. The median price of existing single-family homes rose 3.2% to $280,000 in the Northeast in the first quarter, the NAR said. Mr. Toll reported a mixed bag in the Northeast, calling Putnam and Duchess counties in New York state and the state of Connecticut "B-plus" markets, while Massachusetts was a "D-minus" market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices fell 12.3% to $296,300 in the West and dropped 7.5% to $164,200 in the South. Yet Toll recently raised prices in a development in Naples, Fla., which had been one of the worst housing markets in the nation. "It gave us some happy times, especially considering that Naples was one of the worse markets," Mr. Toll said during the conference call.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across most markets, however, Toll described the spring selling season as "quite weak," as buyers remained on the sidelines, despite improving housing affordability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll's home-building revenue in the quarter ended April 30 fell 30% from the year-earlier period to $817.9 million. Net contracts for new homes fell 44% to 929 homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analyst Ivy Zelman says even if Toll dropped its prices as much as other builders have, that might not generate many more sales in this high- end sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Price is not the issue," Ms. Zelman said. "The problem is that many of Toll's buyers can't sell their existing homes. People are in a situation where they think 'I need to sell my house for $1 million and the best bid is $800,000.' They have negative equity, and they can't afford a down payment on a Toll Brother's home."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As home prices and sales decline, home builders have been writing down billions of dollars of land and inventory values on their books. Joel Rassman, the builder's chief financial officer, estimated second-quarter impairments would be in the range of $225 million to $375 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the bright side, Toll reported about $1.2 billion in cash, which is expected to help the builder weather the downturn while credit tightens to buy land and pay for construction. Toll will release final second-quarter results June 3.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: Where can I find a real estate agent who focuses on selling U.S. properties -- specifically condos around Millennium Park in Chicago -- to foreign buyers?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--Ellis Levin, Chicago</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: Good news in a bad economy: Selling real estate is still one job that can't be outsourced overseas. That means you'll have to rely on local talent -- and not foreign real estate agents -- to reach buyers overseas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your instinct to look overseas is a good one, for several reasons:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite its recent rally, the dollar is at its lowest point in a dozen years against the yen, and remains weak against the pound, the euro and most currencies of developed countries. Three out of 10 foreign buyers who bought in the United States in the 12-month period ending in April came from Europe, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">News of foreclosures, short sales and falling prices has spread around the globe, attracting foreign investors looking for deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Urban real estate in major U.S. cities costs much less than it does in many other industrialized nations. According to the Global Property Guide, an apartment in London costs $28,355 per square meter ($2,637 per square foot), and Paris $15,670 per square meter ($1,457 per square foot). By comparison, according to Chicagocondosonline.com, the median sales price in 2007 for a Chicago condo was only $294 per square foot, which comes to $3,165 per square meter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although it wouldn't be appropriate for me to recommend one real estate agent over another, you can find out how plugged in they are with foreign buyers by visiting their Web sites. Check to see if they speak a foreign language or two, and have listings in American neighborhoods with heavy concentrations of foreign buyers. When you schedule interviews with listing agents, ask them to bring copies of ads they've run in foreign publications, as well as community newspapers or other publications in the U.S. that have strong ethnic connections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even if they don't do these things, it's likely that they still have access to foreign home shoppers through their brokerages. All major real estate brokerages -- and many regional ones as well -- have international divisions or are part of global consortiums these days. One avenue available to all members of the National Association of Realtors is the International Consortium of Real Estate Associations, a nine-year-old group that sets standards for, and facilitates, transnational transactions. But to get your property listed on its global Web site, Worldproperties.com, Realtors must register with the group. Ask every agent you interview if he or she has done so.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Brian Blackstone and Henry J. Pulizzi </div><div>757 words</div><div>8 May 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. productivity rose at a solid pace in the first quarter, suggesting companies are adjusting quickly to the economic slowdown by shedding workers and cutting back on the number of hours worked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Labor costs, meanwhile, grew at their slowest annual pace in four years, easing inflation worries. That is "good news for the Federal Reserve, since without surging labor costs, a 1970s-style wage-price spiral cannot take hold," said Global Insight chief U.S. economist Nigel Gault.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the National Association of Realtors said its index of pending home sales fell 1% in March to a new low. The index was down 20% from a year earlier. <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> economist Michelle Meyer predicted home sales would "bottom midyear at a depressed state of activity."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the White House's top economist said he is confident the economy hasn't slipped into recession, and said that the stimulus checks being distributed by the government could bolster growth in the current quarter, earlier than expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The data are pretty clear that we are not in a recession," said Edward Lazear, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones Newswires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation's economy grew at an anemic 0.6% annual rate in the first three months of the year, the same pace as in the fourth quarter of 2007. Despite the modest growth, many economists believe a recession already is under way, but the official determination is made by the National Bureau of Economic Research. The nonprofit academic group defines a recession as a significant decline in economic activity -- as measured by inflation-adjusted gross domestic product and income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales -- that lasts more than a few months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lazear said only two of those indicators are in recession range -- retail sales and manufacturing activity. "I would be very surprised if the NBER, looking back at this period, would date this as a recession," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department said nonfarm business productivity -- output per hour of work -- rose at a 2.2% annual rate in the first quarter. Productivity jumped 3.2% from the first quarter of 2007, the biggest year-to-year rise in nearly four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unit labor costs -- a key gauge of inflationary pressures -- rose a mild 2.2% in the first quarter, and were up just 0.2% from a year ago. That was the smallest annual rise since 2004, and underscored workers' difficulty in securing higher wages during a slowdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Labor is the biggest single expense in producing goods and services. Gains in productivity are crucial to allowing the economy to expand without rising inflation or declining profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though slightly below the average of recent years, recent productivity increases are impressive given the slowdown. Usually, productivity growth drops at the start of economic slowdowns, reflecting companies' initial reluctance to shed workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Wednesday's report suggests that companies are cutting back on workers and hours worked. The number of hours worked tumbled at a 1.8% pace, the biggest drop in five years, reflecting recent declines in nonfarm payrolls to start the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long-term issues like productivity and underlying growth potential have taken a back seat to crises, centered in the housing and credit markets, that have commanded the Fed's policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the Fed lowered the federal-funds rate -- at which banks lend to each other overnight -- by a quarter-percentage-point to 2% but signaled in a statement that it is likely to hold rates steady for an extended period. If productivity growth stays healthy, easing inflation concerns, the Fed probably won't be in a hurry to raise rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weak dollar also may be contributing to the growth in productivity by channeling more of the economy's resources into business involved in exports. Export-intensive industries tend to have higher productivity than the economy-wide average, studies show. That offsets to some extent the lower productivity found in fast-growing service sectors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturing-sector productivity jumped 4.1%, almost double the average for the economy overall. Meanwhile, consumer borrowing in the U.S. rose in March at an annual rate of 7.2%, the fastest pace in four months and more than double the 3.1% increase of the previous month, the Fed reported. The gain was much larger than economists had expected.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial Building</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rebounded in March</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After declining for several months, spending on commercial construction bounced back in March. According to the Census Bureau, private nonresidential construction spending in March was at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $382.3 billion, up 1.9% from a revised $375.3 billion rate in February. The value of private residential construction continued to fall and was at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $445 billion in March, down 4.6% from $466.7 billion in February.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Cyril Moulle-Berteaux </div><div>1162 words</div><div>6 May 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A23</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dire headlines coming fast and furious in the financial and popular press suggest that the housing crisis is intensifying. Yet it is very likely that April 2008 will mark the bottom of the U.S. housing market. Yes, the housing market is bottoming right now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How can this be? For starters, a bottom does not mean that prices are about to return to the heady days of 2005. That probably won't happen for another 15 years. It just means that the trend is no longer getting worse, which is the critical factor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most people forget that the current housing bust is nearly three years old. Home sales peaked in July 2005. New home sales are down a staggering 63% from peak levels of 1.4 million. Housing starts have fallen more than 50%, and, adjusted for population growth, are back to the trough levels of 1982.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Furthermore, residential construction is close to 15-year lows at 3.8% of GDP; by the fourth quarter of this year, it will probably hit the lowest level ever. So what's going to stop the housing decline? Very simply, the same thing that caused the bust: affordability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The boom made housing unaffordable for many American families, especially first-time home buyers. During the 1990s and early 2000s, it took 19% of average monthly income to service a conforming mortgage on the average home purchased. By 2005 and 2006, it was absorbing 25% of monthly income. For first time buyers, it went from 29% of income to 37%. That just proved to be too much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices got so high that people who intended to actually live in the houses they purchased (as opposed to speculators) stopped buying. This caused the bubble to burst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, house prices have fallen 10%-15%, while incomes have kept growing (albeit more slowly recently) and mortgage rates have come down 70 basis points from their highs. As a result, it now takes 19% of monthly income for the average home buyer, and 31% of monthly income for the first-time home buyer, to purchase a house. In other words, homes on average are back to being as affordable as during the best of times in the 1990s. Numerous households that had been priced out of the market can now afford to get in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next question is: Even if home sales pick up, how can home prices stop falling with so many houses vacant and unsold? The flip but true answer: because they always do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past five major housing market corrections (and there were some big ones, such as in the early 1980s when home sales also fell by 50%-60% and prices fell 12%-15% in real terms), every time home sales bottomed, the pace of house-price declines halved within one or two months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The explanation is that by the time home sales stop declining, inventories of unsold homes have usually already started falling in absolute terms and begin to peak out in "months of supply" terms. That's the case right now: New home inventories peaked at 598,000 homes in July 2006, and stand at 482,000 homes as of the end of March. This inventory is equivalent to 11 months of supply, a 25-year high -- but it is similar to 1974, 1982 and 1991 levels, which saw a subsequent slowing in home-price declines within the next six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories are declining because construction activity has been falling for such a long time that home completions are now just about undershooting new home sales. In a few months, completions of new homes for sale could be undershooting new home sales by 50,000-100,000 annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories will drop even faster to 400,000 -- or seven months of supply -- by the end of 2008. This shift in inventories will have a significant impact on prices, although house prices won't stop falling entirely until inventories reach five months of supply sometime in 2009. A five-month supply has historically signaled tightness in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many pundits claim that house prices need to fall another 30% to bring them back in line with where they've been historically. This is usually based on an analysis of house prices adjusted for inflation: Real house prices are 30% above their 40-year, inflation-adjusted average, so they must fall 30%. This simplistic analysis is appealing on the surface, but is flawed for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most importantly, it neglects the fact that a great majority of Americans buy their houses with mortgages. And if one buys a house with a mortgage, the most important factor in deciding what to pay for the house is how much of one's income is required to be able to make the mortgage payments on the house. Today the rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage is 5.7%. Back in 1981, the rate hit 18.5%. Comparing today's house prices to the 1970s or 1980s, when mortgage rates were stratospheric, is misguided and misleading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is all good news for the broader economy. The housing bust has been subtracting a full percentage point from GDP for almost two years now, which is very large for a sector that represents less than 5% of economic activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the rate of house-price declines halves, there will be a wholesale shift in markets' perceptions. All of a sudden, the expected value of the collateral (i.e. houses) for much of the lending that went on for the past decade will change. Right now, when valuing the collateral, market participants including banks are extrapolating the current pace of house price declines for another two to three years; this has a significant impact on the amount of delinquencies, foreclosures and credit losses that lenders are expected to face.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More home sales and smaller price declines means fewer homeowners will be underwater on their mortgages. They will thus have less incentive to walk away and opt for foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A milder house-price decline scenario could lead to increases in the market value of a lot of the securitized mortgages that have been responsible for $300 billion of write-downs in the past year. Even if write-backs do not occur, stabilizing collateral values will have a huge impact on the markets' perception of risk related to housing, the financial system, and the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are of course experiencing a serious housing bust, with serious economic consequences that are still unfolding. The odds are that the reverberations will lead to sub-trend growth for a couple of years. Nonetheless, housing led us into this credit crisis and this recession. It is likely to lead us out. And that process is underway, right now.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't look for the housing market to improve until the daffodils bloom next spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For home sellers, the continuing pain means that that homes likely won't sell unless they are well-kept, priced below the competition and are marketed aggressively. Adding incentives like seller financing or lease-options can help bring in buyers who are having trouble getting conventional financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index shows that new and existing home prices fell 12.7% in February from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to economists who convened at the spring construction forecast conference of the National Association of Home Builders in Washington, D.C., last week, the trend will continue until early next year, dragging down prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consensus view was far gloomier than a few months ago, when housing economists predicted the bottom would be reached in late summer or early fall. But now the U.S. is in a mild recession, although it hasn't been officially declared, and the pain is spreading to more parts of the country, according to the association's chief economist David F. Seiders. "Foreclosures keep getting worse," he said. "Where in the world does it stop?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosures push homeowners out of their homes and simultaneously ruin their credit, making it difficult for them to become owners again, he said. The drop-off of demand from these owners, as well as would-be buyers who don't want to purchase while prices are still falling has become a "diabolical feedback loop," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders have put the brakes on building -- total annualized housing starts are down 34.5% to 1.035 million in the first quarter of this year and will likely stay at under 1 million until the middle of next year. But demand is still too weak to absorb this pace of building, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist for <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com. It would take 11 months at the current sales rate to sell the new homes now on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zandi expects three quarters of the country's major markets to experience new and existing-home price declines. In places that have been losing jobs, prices could drop as much as 40% from their peaks. "The coast is not clear," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eric Belsky, executive director of Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies, noted that declining home prices, which eroded the equity of many homeowners, "caught people by surprise." He expects to see more households doubling up in shared homes as job loss, foreclosures and the credit squeeze continues. "People are being forced to sleep on floors," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But not all of the economists were as pessimistic about the coming year's prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nariman Behravesh, chief economist of Global Insight, said that while lack of regulatory oversight on Wall Street and interest rates that stayed too low, too long, helped create the current housing debacle, "the worst may be behind us." He noted that there's now a substantial amount of capital available to fix the subprime mess.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economist James Glassman, a managing director of <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;Co.</span>, said that the current quagmire is partly due to creditors overreacting to the subprime-mortgage crisis, leaving only good savers with enough cash able to buy homes. But overall, he said, the American economy is sound, and the crisis will eventually subside as credit becomes freer and home prices stabilize. "The wheels aren't coming off the wagon," he said.</p>
