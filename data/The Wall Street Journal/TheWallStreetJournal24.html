<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WAHIAWA, Hawaii -- The trustee for hundreds of heirs to a large land tract here on Oahu island has agreed to sell their inheritance to the state for preservation as farmland, reversing a decadeslong trend of most such open land being developed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 1,750-acre tract, one of the island's largest undeveloped plots, was the estate of George Galbraith, an Irish immigrant who acquired the land in the 19th century. Ownership of the one-time pineapple farm passed through generations to roughly 600 heirs today. Bank of Hawaii manages the estate in trust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The episode recalls "The Descendants," a 2011 movie starring George Clooney as a trustee in a similar predicament -- whether to sell a huge parcel of Hawaii land for development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The George Galbraith Estate straddles a fertile plain about 20 miles northwest of downtown Honolulu, and developers had for years sought to buy it to further extend the capital's suburbs. The trustee began dissolving the estate in 2007 to meet a state deadline, signing a contract with a real-estate developer for $40 million to build homes on the land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recession sidetracked that plan and, in 2011, the trustee agreed to sell the land to Hawaii for $25 million for conversion into many small farms, say state officials involved in a deal that the parties involved haven't yet made public. The Bank of Hawaii declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The transaction is expected to close by year-end, pending final legal language, says Lea Hong, Hawaii director for the Trust for Public Land, a San Francisco nonprofit that is brokering the deal. State officials say they will lease land to farmers for crops like broccoli and asparagus that now come mostly from the U.S. mainland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of people here are having a wake-up call -- we have been growing houses instead of food, and that has to stop," Ms. Hong says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the 600 Galbraith Estate heirs are upset that the trustee didn't parcel them some land in lieu of money, while others pushed for the higher payback that development would have offered, says Ian Lind, a beneficiary and great-grandson of one who was named in Galbraith's 1904 will.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Lind supports the sale to the state. "All things considered, this takes into account the beneficiaries' interest and the public's interest," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others in Hawaii say the state should let the private sector do the preservation. Jon Gomes, a real-estate developer in Honolulu, says he offered to buy the land for 50 to 70 homes with large lots dedicated to agriculture. "I thought our financing idea was better for ag land" than the state's idea, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">State Rep. Marcus Oshiro says a private transaction wouldn't have ensured preservation. "Estate farms are not really a farming activity" and could lead to further subdivision, says Mr. Oshiro, who pushed for the state deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moves to preserve farmland near Hawaii's cities are rare, given the land's development value. Between 1987 and 2007, Oahu's total cropland fell to about 19,000 acres from 50,000 acres, according to the most recent survey by the <span class="companylink">U.S. Department of Agriculture</span>. Development on former farmland has helped leave Hawaii dependent on imports for 85% of its food compared with about 70% three decades ago, says James Nakatani, executive director of <span class="companylink">Hawaii's Department of Agriculture</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Those people who produce their own food control their own destiny, and we don't," says Larry Jefts, co-owner of Sugarland Farms Inc., a local farming operation, who expects to lease some of the land to replace leased acres he is now losing to development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Galbraith was a cattle rancher from Ireland who left his country in the mid-1800s to follow the California Gold Rush, but he stopped first in Hawaii and never left, according to historical accounts. His estate leased the land for nearly a century to a pineapple plantation that was the heart of the economy in this town of now about 15,000 residents. "We have pineapple juice in our veins," says state Sen. Donovan Dela Cruz, whose father worked on the plantation and is a proponent of the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Galbraith estate's fate has been debated since 1992, when the trustee initially proposed development of an 18-hole golf course and 3,100 homes. When the subsequent 2007 development contract fell through, Mr. Oshiro says he persuaded fellow legislators to set aside $13 million of general obligation bonds to try to buy the land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">State officials worked with the Trust for Public Land, which raised the remaining $12 million through contributions, including from the <span class="companylink">U.S. Army</span>, which wants the land to serve as a buffer between development and its nearby Schofield Barracks, depicted in the 1953 film "From Here to Eternity."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Ag is perfect, because you've got plants, and plants don't complain," says Peter Yuh, conservation branch chief for the <span class="companylink">U.S. Army</span> Garrison-Hawaii.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos </div><div>832 words</div><div>19 November 2012</div><div>17:42</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes were stronger than expected in October, putting them on track to hit their highest annual level since 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.79 million units in October, the second-highest level of the year and up 2.1% from September, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Monday. October's level represented a 10.9% gain from a year earlier and was the 16th consecutive month of year-over-year home-sales gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices are rising amid sharp declines in the number of homes listed for sale. Just 2.14 million homes were for sale at the end of October, down 22% from one year ago to the lowest level in a decade, according to NAR estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With more buyers chasing dwindling inventories of homes—and, in particular, fewer foreclosed properties that sell at steeper discounts—prices are beginning to rise in more markets. The national median home price rose by 11.1% from one year ago in October to $178,600, according to the NAR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are clearly in recovery," said John Burns, chief executive of John Burns Real Estate Consulting in Irvine, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At October's sales pace, there were just 5.4 months of supply. That was the lowest level since February 2006, which was before housing markets began their prolonged decline. One-third of homes sold in October had been on the market for less than a month, according to the Realtors' group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to The Wall Street Journal's quarterly survey of housing-market conditions, inventory levels of homes for sale have fallen in all 28 metropolitan areas tracked in the survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the current pace of sales, there was just one month of supply in Sacramento, Calif., where inventory fell by 56% from one year ago. The months' supply stood at 2.4 in Phoenix, 2.8 in California's Orange County, 3.2 in San Diego and San Francisco, and 3.6 in Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing demand began gaining pace a year ago as prices in many hard-hit markets had fallen so far that investors began scooping up homes at substantial discounts. Rising rents have encouraged many such investors to rent out the houses, rather than putting them on the market and trying to flip them for a profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently, demand among traditional buyers has jumped amid continued declines in interest rates that have made homes, based on monthly mortgage payments, more affordable than at any time in at least 15 years. The <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span> said loan applications for home purchases rose 22% in the first week of November from one year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median home prices have now risen for eight consecutive months, which last occurred in early 2006, just before the housing bubble burst. In part, that reflects an increase in sales of more-expensive homes. Sales of homes priced below $100,000 fell by 0.6% from one year ago in October, while sales of homes priced between $750,000 and $1 million rose by 53%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Craig Moll, of Clearwater, Fla., said his biggest hurdle in buying a home was that there "weren't many to choose from." Mr. Moll sold a townhouse in 2009, as the housing market deteriorated. "Over the course of about a month, the entire opposite side of the street turned into rentals as the market started to crash," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, with mortgage rates at historic lows and home prices "creeping back up, it felt like our time to buy something," he said. This summer, he paid $340,000 with a 10% down payment for a four-bedroom home with a swimming pool in Clearwater. "It wasn't a great deal. It was a good deal," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, housing markets face headwinds, including stringent mortgage-lending standards. Mr. Moll, who is self-employed and advises insurance companies on weather-related car damages, said getting approved for a mortgage was "very, very difficult."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors' group also warned that November's home sales could drop due to Sandy, the superstorm that battered the Atlantic coast from southern New Jersey to New York's Long Island and Connecticut, at the end of October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some buyers already have pulled out of sales agreements while other homes that were under contract must be re-inspected or repaired before banks will finance loans. Compared with September, home sales fell by 1.7% on a seasonally adjusted basis in the Northeast; that contrasts with gains of 4.4% in the West, 2.1% in the South and 1.8% in the Midwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another wildcard: Whether Congress avoids the "fiscal cliff," a series of tax increases and spending cuts set to kick in at year-end, which some real-estate agents worry could undercut consumer confidence, potentially deferring some sales.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto and Heather Haddon </div><div>1125 words</div><div>16 November 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A19</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private landlords in New York City have offered to provide several thousand vacant units to house people displaced by the superstorm Sandy, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is just one of the solutions being rapidly concocted as both New York and New Jersey rush to tackle the most daunting task of Sandy's aftermath: housing tens of thousands of newly homeless people, in a region with few apartments and little empty land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government officials, nonprofit organizations and academics have floated myriad solutions -- from parking a cruise ship in New York Harbor to housing people temporarily in abandoned subway stations. More realistically, officials are cobbling together a plan consisting of vacant apartments and rental houses, government-issued housing units and even a defunct military barracks in New Jersey. They also expect that some displaced people will find shelter with friends and family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The 1% [in Manhattan] vacancy is one thing. Another is we're land-constrained. We are in a housing emergency as we are every year. It's an emergency situation on top of an existing emergency housing situation," said Corinne Packard, a professor who teaches post-catastrophe reconstruction at New York University's Schack Institute of Real Estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Packard said she isn't concerned the city won't be able to come up with enough housing for everyone, but time won't be on its side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The question is how long will people have to live in this tenuous, temporary situation?" she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mayor Michael Bloomberg has publicly speculated that as many as 40,000 people could be displaced by Sandy. He has since revised that estimate to 20,000, but estimates of the region's newly homeless remained unclear Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Emergency Management Agency</span> said Thursday that more than 96,000 applicants are eligible for housing money -- about 63,000 in New York and almost 33,000 in New Jersey. Some of those have been approved for assistance with paying for hotels, while others have received payments for longer term repairs to their homes or help with short-term rental units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York City has appointed Brad Gair, a former deputy emergency management commissioner, to oversee efforts to find shelter for Sandy victims as they rebuild their homes, but details have emerged piecemeal about how that will happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the most sensitive talks have involved private landlords, who have been asked to set aside thousands of apartments and rental homes for Sandy victims. The Real Estate Board of New York, Rent Stabilization Association and <span class="companylink">New York State Association for Affordable Housing</span> met with government officials this week and have agreed in principle to free up a few thousand apartments in the city. Several hundred have been offered by members of the affordable housing association, said Alison Badgett, its executive director.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the plan faces a number of regulatory and practical hurdles, including determining whether residents will be allowed to remain indefinitely, whether to allocate affordable units to low-income storm victims, and setting up a website to connect people with units, people familiar with the negotiations said. The landlords would collect rent, but whether the victims, the government or nonprofit groups -- or a mixture of the three -- pay remains unclear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Landlords said they were ready to help out, as long as they have legal protections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I do think, by the way, that all of this is going to be dealt with, and we'll be able to do what we want to do," said Ron Moelis, a principal at L+M Development Partners, who said he could make available up to 170 apartments primarily in northern Manhattan and the South Bronx.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New Jersey, real estate groups and hotels have identified more than 5,000 units that could be made available, said Lisa Ryan, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Community Affairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">New Jersey Association of Realtors</span> has sent listings of homes to FEMA that could be rented on a temporary basis, including vacant summer homes. But a lack of rental supply may require people to move outside their immediate vicinity, said Jarrod Grasso, the association's CEO. "It's an inconvenience but at least it's a roof over their heads," Mr. Grasso said about those searching for apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are other options for Sandy victims. FEMA has prepared 40 temporary housing units, but state officials haven't requested their use yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Jersey plans to house at least 400 families in Fort Monmouth, a decommissioned army base that was closed last year. Demand is expected to outstrip supply at Fort Monmouth, Gov. Chris Christie said, and FEMA will conduct a lottery for the spots. "Some folks will wind up in Fort Monmouth, and others will wind up in private apartments or homes," Mr. Christie said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Relocating people for extended periods is a sensitive proposition. Coney Island and the South Bronx are in the same city but feel like different worlds to many. Moreover, with the vacancy rate at about 3% citywide, empty rental units promise at best a partial solution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some, the displacement will be temporary. In Lower Manhattan, where floodwaters destroyed building infrastructure and made luxury units cold, dark and inaccessible, residents could return in a few weeks or less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the storm is expected to remake entire neighborhoods in coastal areas of New York and New Jersey. Many could be out of their homes for months before returning -- if they ever do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the Rockaway Peninsula, City Councilman James Sanders' chief of staff Donovan Richards said whole blocks of homes may have to be razed in severely damaged neighborhoods including Arverne and a section of bungalows in Far Rockaway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bungalow area, a square-mile of roughly 100 low-lying, one-story thatched homes, has been largely deserted after the storm. "I know that a lot of them suffered enough water damage that they have to vacate," Mr. Richards said. "In some cases the buildings department has said they need to be torn down."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Sena, who lives in Breezy Point at the end of the peninsula, estimates it will cost about $200,000 to fix his destroyed two-story home. Mr. Sena, 40 years old, had allowed his flood insurance to lapse. Mr. Sena, who rode out the storm at home, has been crashing with friends like a "gypsy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I have an inspection Saturday. If it doesn't go well, we're boarding up the house," he said. "I can't afford to fix it."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Eliot Brown </div><div>1053 words</div><div>16 November 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Skyscrapers are going on a diet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York, Tel Aviv, Vancouver and other cities around the globe, skinny apartment towers are on the rise, sprouting like luxury beanstalks from small lots -- some only as wide as a handful of townhomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While thin towers already crowd the skyline in land-starved cities like Hong Kong, developers elsewhere generally eschewed the slim structures, opting for larger, more stable floors -- typically at least 10,000 square feet for tall buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that's been changing lately. In New York, work has begun on the planned tower at 432 Park Ave., designed by architect Rafael Vinoly, that is expected to have approximately 8,250-square-foot floors and is slated to rise to about 145 feet taller than the Empire State Building. Just one block south of Central Park, the 1,004-foot-tall One57 -- which saw its crane break during superstorm Sandy -- is under construction, with floors as small as 6,240 square feet. And the Cetra/Ruddy-designed One Madison Park, a 597-foot tower with 3,300-square-foot floors, is nearing completion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fueling the drive toward slim living is an array of factors led by robust demand from the upper crust of the residential market willing to pay for premium views. Advances both in structural design and building materials have also made constructing skinny skyscrapers possible. In the end, higher prices mean developers can build on small sites that in the past wouldn't have allowed it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you can build more slender and higher, you can get more units with good views -- and height is valued," said Vancouver, British Columbia, developer Jon Stovell, who last year finished a 350-foot tower that has 4,850-square-foot floors. Mr. Stovell said that it was one of the last development sites in the tony Coal Harbour neighborhood, and that sale prices of more than $1,000 per square foot justified the added costs of building high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, many of the developers have high ambitions for sales. In Tel Aviv, developer Berggruen Residential Ltd. is building a 590-foot-tall condo tower designed by architect Richard Meier that sports 8,450-square-foot floors and a 13,454-square-foot duplex penthouse that is listed for $50 million. In New York, buyers are signing up for condos at One57 at record-setting prices. Developer Extell Development Co. said two buyers have agreed to pay more than $90 million for two penthouses, which would be the most expensive apartment sales ever in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the 120-plus units planned for 432 Park, developer CIM Group is asking an average $4,800 per square foot. The developer has filed plans with the state to list a six-bedroom penthouse for $85 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building high, of course, gets expensive. As the floor count goes up, steel takes longer to lift and high winds can stall construction. Slender towers need a giant device, called a damper, toward the top to counter sway from wind. Without such features, buildings could rock to the point of making residents motion-sick.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's definitely not easy or cheap," said Michael Stern, managing partner of JDS Development Group, which is planning to soon start construction on a 679-foot tower on a lot just 43-feet wide down the block from One57. Rising high-end apartment prices, he said, have helped make such buildings possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Technology has also helped give rise to the buildings. For instance, the material of choice for apartment towers, steel-reinforced concrete, is more than twice as strong as a generation ago. Software in engineering offices can much better predict issues like how much a tower might sway, allowing for more efficient buildings with fewer columns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Ten years ago, the tools were a lot rougher," said Ahmad Rahimian, chief executive at WSP Cantor Seinuk, a structural-engineering firm that's currently working on at least a half-dozen narrow, tall apartment towers. "It's getting a lot more sophisticated."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result has been a rise of pencil-shaped towers that quickly alter skylines, and more are on the way. One is a nearly 800-foot building named 56 Leonard in Tribeca, and the other is Mr. Stern's building, in which upper floors would be as small as 1,400 square feet, according to building permits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the structural supports nevertheless can restrict the view. But generally, developers are betting that having fewer residents per floor will give the towers a boutique quality that residents wouldn't get with large, shared hallways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It gives the opportunity for more exclusivity, better views," said Pamela Liebman, president of <span class="companylink">Corcoran Group</span>, the real-estate company advising on buildings including One57 and 56 Leonard. "I've never had someone say, 'Can't you show me an apartment with a longer hallway?'"</p>

</div><div class="author">By Craig Karmin and Gregory Zuckerman </div><div>919 words</div><div>14 November 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">North Dakota, an epicenter of the nation's oil rush, is grappling with a scramble reminiscent of the most-heated periods of the housing boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, private-equity firm <span class="companylink">KKR &amp; Co</span>. is trying to capitalize by making a multimillion-dollar bet on a housing project in a town at the heart of it all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">KKR</span> is expected to announce Wednesday that it will develop a sprawling master-planned community that could become a modern-day Levittown on the North Dakota plains. The project in Williston is expected to serve some of the thousands of workers pouring into the region who are searching for jobs but facing inadequate housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The population is going to double or triple over the next handful of years," said Ralph Rosenberg, head of <span class="companylink">KKR</span>'s real-estate team. "We have in many respects a first-mover advantage."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">KKR</span> project, being developed with two partners over a 164-acre area, will include 810 apartments, 737 single-family homes, a park, sports fields and other facilities, according to <span class="companylink">KKR</span>. When completed, the new community is expected to provide housing for about 4,000 people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sharp population growth of cities such as Williston harkens back to the boomtowns that mushroomed in western Pennsylvania in the years after Edwin Drake drilled the country's first oil well in 1859. As one example, a family farm grew into a town named Pithole with a population of 15,000 in just nine months, according to Barbara Zolli, director of the Drake Well Museum in Titusville, Pa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">KKR</span> and its partners plan to spend up to $150 million to build the Williston apartments and to prepare lots to sell to home builders. Analysts estimate it could cost another $150 million to build those homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Williston has a population of about 25,000 and an unemployment rate of less than 1%, thanks to its location above oil-rich rock layers. As of May, the county surrounding Williston had nearly 1,700 unfilled jobs and 240 people unemployed. North Dakota has passed Alaska to become the nation's second-leading oil producer after Texas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate specialists say homes in the town, where the local <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span> over the summer boosted wages to $17 an hour from $12.40, don't stay on the market more than a few weeks. They estimate the housing market will tighten further over the next few months in a town where discount hotels regularly charge $200 a night and many oil-rig workers live in so-called man-camps -- armylike barracks charging $100 a night -- or sleep in cars at parking lots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another sign of the boom: There have been over 1,400 houses built in Williston so far this year, the city says. In 2003, there were just 27 built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some companies, such as manufactured-home maker Fleetwood Homes, a subsidiary of <span class="companylink">Cavco Industries, Inc</span>., have begun to focus on the growing demand. Fleetwood has designed an extra-insulated "Dakota" model for the region. But locals say demand is still greater than supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Williston is in the northwestern corner of the state, near the Missouri River and at the center of an oil-rich area known as the Bakken formation. While it is adding hotels, a casino and restaurants, the town is dotted with trailer camps, and much of it remains raw and desolate. Temperatures struggle to get above freezing for nearly half the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vern Brekhus, who manages the <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> in Williston, said he recently paid $180,000 to buy a four-bedroom home that a few years ago would have cost about $50,000. He said he got a deal on the home because he knew the seller. "You have to pay cash or you lose out" in bidding wars, he said. "It's hard because rents keep rising and they're not building homes fast enough."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">KKR</span> is expecting that homes at its development will sell within the range of the current market: $200,000 to $400,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Rolfstad, executive director of Williston Economic Development, said some longtime residents grumble that this boomtown is no longer an attractive place to retire and that lines are getting too long at movie theaters and restaurants. But he said the new housing is sorely needed to boost the existing shortfall. "We need investment on this kind of scale if we are going to going to get any parity between supply and demand," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rolfstad said a half-dozen investment firms are starting or planning residential projects in the town, though none are on the scale of <span class="companylink">KKR</span>'s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because there are few, if any, comparable developments, skeptics say <span class="companylink">KKR</span> will have to rely on rough cost estimates. The firm and its partners will have to look beyond Williston to find enough construction workers, and these people will need places to live while they build new homes. Also, a plunge in oil prices could dry up production in the Bakken.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">KKR</span> has experience in North Dakota oil, giving it confidence the city's expansion will continue. Last year, <span class="companylink">KKR</span> spent $7.2 billion to purchase energy company <span class="companylink">Samson Investment Co</span>., which has North Dakota wells in the Williston area. <span class="companylink">KKR</span> is using its cash and that of a company it manages, <span class="companylink">KKR Financial Holdings LLC</span>, for the investment.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto </div><div>963 words</div><div>14 November 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A22</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every morning around 10 a.m. for the past 1 1/2 weeks, the editorial staff of CollegeHumor trickled into a Park Slope beer hall, where they plugged in their laptops and began a typical workday: writing sketches, holding editorial meetings and brainstorming for ad sales campaigns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The makeshift office -- or "bar-ffice" as the team re-christened it -- has served as one of the comedy website's outposts since the West Chelsea headquarters of its parent company, <span class="companylink">InterActiveCorp</span>, was shut down because of heavy flooding sustained during Sandy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Frank Gehry-designed IAC building is expected to fully reopen Wednesday, but hundreds of companies are bracing for weeks -- and in some cases, months -- of dislocation from offices in Lower Manhattan and West Chelsea. While some have had employees work remotely, many technology, media and design firms said the storm revealed the limits of relying solely on electronic communication -- once expected to spell doom for the traditional office environment for these types of firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's tough for creative teams to work remotely by themselves," said Streeter Seidell, editor in chief of CollegeHumor.com, who scoured Park Slope for a suitable WiFi-equipped bar to accommodate about a dozen workers. He eventually landed the beer-hall space at St. Marks Place near Fourth Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Staffers sat on benches at long wooden tables and Mr. Seidell said they have been surprisingly productive. No one started drinking before noon. The biggest disruption at the temporary location was a local parenting group that also used the space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The biggest change has been the Park Slope moms. They come here in a herd of 15 moms with 15 screaming kids, and one or two dads who look lost, all enjoying a nice German beer," Mr. Seidell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now with the IAC building's reopening, Mr. Seidell said some part of him holds out the hope the team's productivity would warrant a more permanent move to Brooklyn, where he lives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I wake up four minutes before I go work [now]. That's been a dream of mine forever because I'm lazy. I had one moment where I thought, maybe if this goes so well they'll say, 'Maybe you guys should just set up in Brooklyn,'" he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clusters of tenants displaced from Lower Manhattan and West Chelsea can be found in Downtown Brooklyn and Midtown Manhattan. But suitable office space -- outfitted with desks, Internet and heat -- has been challenging to come by. Companies that rent space by the week or month said they've been overwhelmed with requests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Virgo Business Centers</span>, an office suites provider, just opened a new facility at 14 Penn Plaza, which went from empty to completely rented in just a few days. Its other two Midtown facilities are also nearly full, thanks in part to the storm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're hoping that some of these might turn into permanent customers in that I think some people are feeling skittish about being downtown altogether," said Joe Scharf, the company's chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least for the first couple of weeks after the storm hit Oct. 29, companies often told employees to work from home. While the chance to stay in bed and use their laptops seemed appealing before Sandy, many workers said they found the stay-at-home experience to be frustratingly unproductive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We were joking that we would probably need an adjustment period to go back to the office but still be able to wear pajamas," said Megan Kerman, a 31-year-old graphic designer, who worked from her apartment in Crown Heights after the storm. "Being at home is distracting. I'd think, 'I should do the dishes because I'm here,'" she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Kerman's design firm is located in 88 Pine St. and she said the company is preparing for the possibility they won't be able to return until the new year. She started working Tuesday at temporary space in Union Square.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some downtown companies, the experience of working remotely or spending a couple of weeks in Midtown has been a mixed adventure. "We're going to go explore for lunch and do TGI Friday's. That's our Midtown experience," said Kerry Trainor, chief executive of Vimeo, which is also normally located in the IAC Building, but took temporary space at 38th Street and Seventh Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But others said the storm has raised more serious concerns about the vulnerability of their offices to similar disruptions. Even firms that were well backed up were reminded of the occasional indispensability of paper. Law firm <span class="companylink">Sullivan &amp; Cromwell LLP</span>, whose offices at 125 Broad St. were flooded, had backup servers outside of the city, but they still needed paralegals and attorneys to climb as high as the 36th floor to retrieve documents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Maddox, a senior managing director at FTI Consulting, a crisis-management and consulting firm, has been out of his offices more than two weeks. When he's not traveling, he conducts conference calls from the veranda of his century-old home on the Hudson in Westchester while watching the autumn leaves fall. A number of employees also relocated to the company's other office in Times Square.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You never have all your stuff, even in the electronic age. Every crisis is 4 feet, sometimes 9 feet, of legal documents," Mr. Maddox said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm's building on Water Street, was also flooded in 1993, which Mr. Maddox said raises long-term concerns about its waterfront location.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When it happens twice you don't call it a crisis anymore," Mr. Maddox said. "I'm giving serious consideration to higher ground."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Dawn Wotapka </div><div>905 words</div><div>12 November 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An improving housing market has triggered the biggest rally that home-builder stocks have seen in years, with prices of some stocks more than doubling this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But will corporate earnings justify those lofty gains? This week could provide answers when two large public builders, <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Beazer Homes USA Inc</span>., report quarterly results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both companies should see sales and orders pick up as consumers take advantage of the record-low interest rates that have made buying a home cheaper than renting in many markets. But some industry watchers say that this just isn't enough to support such eye-popping gains: With every major builder showing a double-digit improvement, the <span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> U.S. Home Construction Index has spiked about 80% since January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While sales have improved from their post-housing crash lull -- builders are on track to sell 389,000 new homes this year -- that rate is only slightly above 2009's 375,000 and well below the peak's 1.3 million, according to the Census Bureau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Goldberg, a builder analyst with <span class="companylink">UBS</span>, said current stock values price in annual new-home sales between 800,000 and 900,000. "This seems aggressive," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A big concern is the fiscal cliff, which threatens to derail recent economic recovery. Meanwhile, the foreclosure crisis drags on and mortgage lending standards remain stubbornly tight, keeping many would-be buyers away from the closing table.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These latest earnings results won't include any impact from Hurricane Sandy, but analysts will look for any discussion of increased competition, shortages and rising prices for construction supplies and labor. Even before the storm, some builders complained they were paying 21% more for framing lumber than they were a year ago. Should material prices climb further, builders would likely raise selling prices to avoid depressing margins. Of course, higher prices could push some consumers to buy existing homes, which are typically far cheaper than new homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the market opens Monday, all eyes will be on Horton, the nation's largest builder by annual closings, which has seen shares rise about 65% this year. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect it to report a profit of 28 cents a share, well above 11 cents a year ago. <span class="companylink">UBS</span> expects closings and orders to each increase 20%, while average closing prices could tick up 5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Horton, based in Fort Worth, Texas, has long been a favorite with industry analysts because its management team avoids risk and it constructs low-price homes accessible to many buyers. It also runs a credit-repair program that broadens its buying pool to consumers with weaker credit, and it builds in many markets that some competitors overlook, such as Boise, Idaho, and northwest Indiana.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While other builders are focused on the move-up market, Horton has cornered the entry-level market," said Alex Barron, senior research analyst with the Housing Research Center. "They are now starting to expand into some B and C markets earlier than others, which will add to their growth. Rather than betting solely on price appreciation, they are moving to where the people will be able to afford a home in the next few years."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a return of about 40% this year, <span class="companylink">Beazer</span>, the nation's ninth largest builder, is one of the sector's weakest performers. <span class="companylink">Beazer</span> also will report its earnings on Monday. It is projected to lose $1.22 per share in its fourth quarter, an improvement from a loss of $2.91 per share a year ago. <span class="companylink">UBS</span> expects closings to increase just 2%, orders to pick up 15% and average closing prices to slip 1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the company is benefiting from the healing housing market, it continues working to recover from previous corporate missteps, including a federal probe into lending practices and a settlement with the <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span> over accounting issues that helped force out longtime CEO Ian McCarthy in 2011. Allan Merrill, who was promoted from within, has helped improve the balance sheet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">UBS</span>'s Mr. Goldberg is confident <span class="companylink">Beazer</span> will improve over time because it is focusing on selling the right product in the right location and has cut costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Horton "has consistently been one of the best management teams in the business," he said. "For <span class="companylink">Beazer</span>, it's more of a work in progress. They're on the right track."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Eliot Brown and Josh Barbanel </div><div>826 words</div><div>9 November 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the past decade, U.S. cities have focused on developing housing, stores, offices and grand public spaces along their waterfronts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then came Sandy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The extreme damage from the storm that slammed the East Coast last week has raised concerns among planners, developers and city officials that stricter building codes and other changes may be needed for these low-lying areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few suggest that waterfront development should be abandoned. But construction along bays and oceans is expected to become more costly as builders, insurers and regulators adjust. "We need to make sure this is part of our long-term planning," said Brian Swett, Boston's top environmental official.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One approach to protect waterfronts from flooding would be to invest billions in infrastructure projects, such as sea barriers or the kind of giant levees found in some European cities. But given the fiscally strained state of most governments, such moves would be politically difficult.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More modest measures are more likely. Even before Sandy struck, many mayors were in the early stages of considering changes to building codes to require such things as locating emergency generators, fuel tanks and electrical-supply systems on higher floors at waterfront developments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These buildings are going to have to be built to withstand extreme weather," said Douglas Durst, a developer in New York who had one low-lying property sustain substantial damage last week. "Building on the waterfront is going to be more expensive than building inland."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The costs of such changes would range from site to site, developers said. Many could be relatively inexpensive. Developer Richard LeFrak said things such as raising building entrance heights and moving mechanical equipment higher likely would add less than 5% to a building's price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developer Jeff Levine, who built a tower on the Brooklyn, N.Y., waterfront, estimated that adding flood-resistant features to residential buildings, including above-ground generators and a waterproof "bathtub" basement, can add around $5 per square foot, on top of the roughly $300-per-square-foot construction cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wes Wyman, a developer and former president of the Home Builders Association of Greater New Orleans, estimated that building costs there have risen 18% to 20% since Hurricane Katrina. New standards mandate such things as raising buildings by up to three feet in some areas and moving mechanical systems above ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wary of hurricane damage, South Florida has revised its building code repeatedly, adding an array of requirements, from stronger windows to limiting uses of the ground floor, given worries about flooding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Kaplan, a Miami-based principal at real estate services firm <span class="companylink">Ackman Ziff Real Estate Group</span>, estimated building costs are about 50% higher now given the requirements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers generally try to pass on additional costs to buyers and renters. Experts say demand for housing is so strong along the water in cities such as New York that the additional expenses wouldn't be great enough to slow development. But for marginal sites and cities with lower land values, substantial added costs could tip the balance on some projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For much of the past two centuries there were fewer such worries because docks and factories, not housing and offices, lined urban coasts. But after manufacturing and shipping moved elsewhere, officials and developers sought to breathe new life into the areas. Along the Eastern Seaboard, nearly 3,200 acres of urban waterfront has been developed with residential and mixed-use buildings over the past 20 years, estimates the nonprofit Urban Land Institute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big master-planned projects that have sprouted up in recent decades include Battery Park City in New York, Harborplace in Baltimore and Mission Bay in San Francisco. More recent ones include a new seaport district in Boston, where developers are building apartment towers and offices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York City has been particularly aggressive in urging changes along the water. Last year, the city said in a report that about 20,000 apartment units had been built in waterfront blocks over the past two decades, while 6,000 more were in the pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But because the land is low-lying, this development may be on a collision course with an apparent increase in extreme weather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The risk has been in full display in New York. High-end apartments on Manhattan's West Side are closed as they dry out their flooded lobbies and basements, where mechanical equipment was damaged. Among them are two Modernist glass towers designed by architect Richard Meier overlooking the Hudson River.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bernhard Karpf, a partner at <span class="companylink">Richard Meier &amp; Partners</span>, said the buildings rest on podiums about three feet above street level. But that wasn't enough to stop floodwaters, which rose as high as five feet. "We are all smarter after the fact," Mr. Karpf said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Alyssa Abkowitz </div><div>1173 words</div><div>9 November 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the resort town of Vail, Colo., real-estate professionals are stepping up efforts to court an increasingly important group of luxury ski-home shoppers: wealthy buyers from Mexico.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slifer Smith &amp; Frampton, a brokerage based in Avon, Colo., recently unveiled a Latin American division and now makes several trips to Mexico City to host dinners and cocktail parties for potential homeowners. On a jaunt in late October, the firm co-sponsored a dinner at the home of a well-known Mexican television executive for 60 guests, who ate ceviche and sipped Champagne. "Several of the attendees are already looking," says Beatriz Martinez, the head of the new division. And this winter, the firm is printing its first buying guide in Spanish and working with local banks and title companies with personnel who speak Spanish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm has also partnered with Glika International, a boutique real-estate firm in Mexico City, and Ski Madness, a real-estate and ski company, offering them 50% of the commission -- much larger than a typical referral fee -- for sending high-net-worth Mexicans interested in Vail to their agency. In turn, Glika and Ski Madness help sponsor various local events, such as a VIP dinner Ski Madness co-sponsored in late October. Currently, Slifer Smith &amp; Frampton says it has 50% market share in Vail, a market where prices are still down 30% from their peak in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Vail has long been popular among wealthy Mexican families, a recent real-estate spree has been fueled, in some cases, by a desire for security. "Safety is a huge issue for many of these families," says Julie Bergsten, vice president of Slifer Smith &amp; Frampton. "We've even seen some families move here full-time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mexican buyers have been behind a number of big-ticket sales in Vail this year. At the Four Seasons Residences, a three-bedroom, three-bathroom home sold for $4.2 million over the summer to a business executive from Mexico City. In the spring, a Mexican buyer bought a $7.5 million home on Gore Creek Place, a desirable street overlooking Vail Mountain. And two out of the last three sales at the Solaris, one of the newest developments in Vail Village, sold to Mexican families this year with price tags around $6 million each.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FirstBank, a regional bank, has made loans to more than a dozen Mexican buyers in the past year, up from only "two or three a year" five years ago, says James Wilkins, senior vice president. "They've been a strength in the last couple of years, when there was a dearth of high-end buyers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mexico's economy has weathered the global financial turmoil, but well-financed drug cartels continue to place growing pressure on the country to deal with rising violence. Earlier this year, the Mexican government released data that showed crime-related deaths increased 11% in the first nine months of 2011 compared with the same period in 2010. That has spurred Mexican business people with families to spend more time outside of Mexico, real-estate agents say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alejandro Marti, the CEO of a Mexican sporting-goods store, moved his family to Vail permanently after a crime-related family tragedy. In 2009, Mr. Marti bought the bankrupt Vail Plaza hotel and remodeled it into the Sebastian, an upscale hotel-condo development aimed at providing a hub for Mexican culture and art. "Everything in Vail is European-oriented," Mr. Marti says. The Sebastian opened at the end of 2011, and in the past year, three families from Mexico each purchased eight-week memberships, or fractionals, for $580,000 a pop; one family purchased multiple weeks at the Sebastian for a total of $1.1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alex Martinez, a lawyer from Mexico City, purchased a $390,000 fractional ownership at the Sebastian that allows him to use the property for four weeks a year. He bought earlier this year after hearing that Mr. Marti owned the development. "He's a very well-known businessman, and whatever he does he puts his heart into it," Mr. Martinez says. In all, about 40% of the Sebastian's condo buyers are from Mexico.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Solaris, a trendy upscale residential complex in Vail Village, Latin Americans have bought 60% of the units that have sold for more than $12 million, with Mexicans making up the majority of those buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If a certain group selects a place, it's likely others will follow," says Johannes Faessler, a longtime Vail resident and proprietor of the Sonnenalp, a European-style hotel in town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the lure is Vail's focus on family-oriented activities. For example, the Solaris has a 70,000-square-foot complex with a bowling alley, a movie theater, an ice-skating rink and a shopping center. During peak vacation weeks, retailers in Vail will set up extra playrooms for the barrage of children and nannies or add kid-friendly food to menus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest concern that can trip up real-estate deals for many Mexican buyers is security. Many of the buyers in Vail are so private that it has been difficult to process loans, since the buyers are reluctant to turn over tax returns or financial statements. Mr. Wilkins, the FirstBank executive, notes that acquiring private loans along family lines is still prevalent in Mexico.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Sometimes it comes down to, 'If you want this property, we need a complete financial picture,'" he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mexican real-estate rush has also started a new campaign to bring a direct flight from Mexico City to Eagle County airport, which is about 30 miles away from Vail compared with Denver's 120-mile trek. Says Kent Myers, an airline consultant who's leading the effort to woo Eagle County officials to expand its air service: "That could really move the dial."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pay cash for your next home or get a mortgage? Some wealthy home buyers are choosing both.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's called delayed financing, in which buyers pay cash for a home and then take out a mortgage soon after closing. Rarely used even two years ago, experts say it has picked up over the past 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was an extremely unusual phenomenon, but it's going on quite a bit now," says Jack McCabe, an independent housing analyst in Deerfield Beach, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The practice is growing mostly in affluent coastal housing markets, including New York and San Francisco. And it all boils down to competition. Sales of million-dollar-plus homes are on the rise nationwide, while inventory remains limited. All-cash buyers have a better chance of standing out from competing bids and getting the home at a lower price since their offer isn't contingent on financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the deal is done, these buyers also want to regain some liquidity. So they get a mortgage and, in some cases, stash this money in investments that might have higher returns than what they pay in mortgage interest. Other options: They might use it to purchase another property or to simply bolster their cash cushion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, William Martin and his wife closed on a 6,500-square-foot home in Diablo, Calif. Sensing that there was a lot of buyer demand for it, the couple gave a competitive offer: all cash, at slightly above the $1.785 million asking price. Those funds came from a mix of savings and money from his father-in-law and a friend, who were paid back a few months later when the Martins got a delayed-financing mortgage from <span class="companylink">Fremont Bank</span>, a community bank in San Francisco. "That's what helped me make the decision to go forward with the purchase from the beginning," Mr. Martin says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Delayed financing is similar to a cash-out refinance -- in which a borrower with a mortgage also takes equity out of the home. But cash-out refis may require waiting a few months or longer to execute, says Keith Gumbinger, a vice president at mortgage-info website HSH.com. Rates and fees can also be higher, partly because of the extra legwork involved transitioning from an existing loan to a new one. Conversely, buyers who apply for delayed financing can be considered as early as the day after they become the new homeowner, since they own the property free and clear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, not all delayed-finance options are alike. Some lenders, including <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> and <span class="companylink">Fremont Bank</span>, say they charge the same interest rate and fees on this mortgage as they would if the borrower applied while buying the home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other lenders charge a rate somewhere between a regular mortgage and a cash-out refi rate, which can be higher. National lender EverBank says its delayed-financing rates are often about one-eighth of a percentage point higher than regular mortgages. Community bank <span class="companylink">Grand Rapids State Bank</span>, based in Grand Rapids, Minn., says rates can be 10 to 30 basis points -- or 0.10 to 0.30 percentage point -- higher than on a regular mortgage. Noah Wilcox, the bank's president and CEO, says the higher rate often influences buyers to sign up for the more affordable purchase mortgage upfront. "When you talk about $1.5 million, that can add up quickly," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's what to consider regarding delayed financing:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Loans types vary. For delayed-financing applicants, many lenders provide a regular mortgage, but some offer pricier alternatives, like a home-equity loan or a home-equity line of credit. Their rates average 6.44% and 5.06%, respectively, according to HSH.com. In contrast, rates on 30-year private market jumbo mortgages average 4.03%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Limits on equity withdrawal. In many cases, homeowners will need to keep at least 20% to 25% equity in their home after withdrawing funds. Separately, the lenders mentioned here offer loans that run into the millions via delayed financing. But some lenders don't, instead capping out at lower limits set by the government. That's $417,000 in most parts of the country but can run up to $625,500 in some pricier metro areas. By keeping to those limits, lenders can try to sell these loans to <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Thorough underwriting. In most cases, lenders check applicants' credit scores and tax returns -- and they also ask for copies of statements that show where the funds to buy the home came from, a copy of the wire transfer, and the receipt for the home purchase. Lenders say they do this partly to screen out buyers who might try to hide money or who are involved in transactions that help sellers evade taxes on the sale.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Conor Dougherty   </div><div>461 words</div><div>8 November 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices appreciated in a growing number of cities during the third quarter, the latest evidence that the real-estate recovery is gaining momentum and breadth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for an existing single-family home was $186,000 in the third quarter, up 7.6% from a year earlier and the largest year-over-year growth since 2006, according to a report Wednesday from the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. More cities saw gains. Single-family home prices rose in 120 of 149 metropolitan areas tracked by the NAR, up from 110 in the second quarter and 39 in the year-ago period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the sharpest home-price rebounds have been in markets hard hit by the real-estate bust. In the Phoenix metropolitan area, for instance, median prices were up 34.9% from a year ago, according to the NAR. Three cities pummeled by the bust -- Las Vegas, Miami and Riverside, Calif. -- all were in the top 20 for price gains with year-over-year increases between 12.0% and 12.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median prices for existing homes measure the midpoint in sales at a given point in time for homes that aren't newly built. The level of gains can be skewed if the mix of homes being sold shifts from one month to another. Median prices can rise, for instance, when more expensive homes sell in one month compared with the previous month, even if prices for those homes don't rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there is little doubt that the housing market has improved in the past year. There are fewer "distressed" homes for sale -- such as foreclosures and bank sales that tend to drag down prices -- and that has whittled the inventory of unsold homes. In addition, rising rents and low interest rates have spurred buyers to return to the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the close of the third quarter there were about 2.32 million existing homes for sale, down 20% from the third quarter of 2011. And rates for a 30-year fixed mortgage averaged 3.54% in the third quarter -- a rock-bottom level by historical standards -- which was down from a still-low 4.31% average a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All told, low home prices, rising rents and a slowly improving economy have given more Americans the motivation and confidence to become homeowners. About 72% of respondents said it was a good time to buy a home, according to a monthly survey <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> issued Wednesday. While many consumers expect home prices to rise only modestly over the next year, they believe rental rates will continue to climb, further motivating them to buy.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tokyo's office market is witnessing a flight to safety.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the memories of the devastating 9.0-magnitude earthquake of March 2011 still fresh, a growing number of businesses are moving to the newest buildings with state-of-the-art engineering and design to protect occupants against a temblor of similar magnitude or worse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investment, development and leasing decisions are being shaped by worries about the "Big One" that is forecast to hit Tokyo some day. For example, few investors today would consider a property built before 1981, when Japan introduced much more stringent building codes, experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New projects, meanwhile, are being leased up faster than expected and owners of the most-modern buildings have been able to raise rents thanks to the new demand. The trends foreshadow what could be ahead in superstorm Sandy-soaked New York City, where downtown office-building landlords already are exploring ways to gain a competitive advantage by improving flood protection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buildings in central Tokyo open for less than one year, which can offer the latest technology in earthquake protection, are now commanding average leasing rates that are 40% above the level for older buildings, according to figures from real-estate brokerage Miki Shoji Co. That is up 10 percentage points since just before the 2011 earthquake, which struck off the coast of northern Japan and left more than 18,000 dead or missing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The quake caused pockets of damage in Tokyo, 240 miles from the epicenter, but it was enough to rock major buildings, as well as market psychology. Tall buildings in central Tokyo swayed for several minutes or more, sending chairs rolling across office floors and unnerving workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investment management firm <span class="companylink">T. Rowe Price Group Inc</span>. said earthquake safety was an important issue in its recent search for newer premises in central Tokyo. The firm plans to move in February from its current 1984-built structure to a more-modern five-year-old office tower nearby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After experiencing the swaying that hit their current 20th-floor offices, "there was a desire to move to a new building on a lower floor," said Campbell Gunn, branch manager for <span class="companylink">T. Rowe Price</span> International Ltd. "We have been assured that the new building is one of the top 10 in the country in terms of earthquake safety," he said, noting that the new offices are on the seventh floor</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A survey last December by <span class="companylink">Mori Building Co</span>., one of the city's biggest developers, showed that better quake resistance was cited by 35% of companies as an important factor in relocating to new offices, up from 15% in the 2010 survey before the quake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meantime, older property is suffering as the office market struggles with a post-financial downturn in vacancy rates that remains stubbornly high by historical standards. Overall, 8.9% of the 251 million square feet of office space in the five main business districts of central Tokyo was vacant in September, compared with 2.49% in November 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"After the earthquake, tenants' views changed greatly, and they are giving a higher priority to safety and the security of their employees," said Yasuhiro Shikuya, senior manager of office leasing at <span class="companylink">Mitsubishi Estate Co</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This shift comes at a time when foreign investors have been developing a greater taste for Japanese real estate. Despite slim prospects for a sharp rise in property prices amid the country's stagnant economy, Japan's real estate has something that investors prize highly these days: a strong annual return on their investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An investor buying into a modern office building in central Tokyo can expect to see a return of 5.5% annually, according to industry brokers. With the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond offering less than 0.8%, the yield spread is among the widest in comparable property markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private-equity firm MGPA Ltd. said the stability and strength of returns in the Tokyo market make it an attractive investment. "You couldn't get similar yield spreads in Hong Kong, Singapore, or any of the other mature Asian markets," said Paul Slimming, head of the firm's Japan operation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Tokyo investment landscape looks much different than that of New York, Paris, London and numerous other cities, where older buildings are prized for their architecture and hipper feel. In Tokyo, developers have been steadily razing and replacing office buildings to offer the latest in technology so they can build bigger and safer on the sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Nobody wants to be in buildings built before 1981," said Cenk Simsek, Japan property analyst for brokers CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earthquake concerns were a key consideration for <span class="companylink">Kirin Holdings Co</span>., one of Japan's biggest beverage groups, in deciding where to consolidate its disparate offices and staff of 2,500 into new headquarters in Tokyo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is a new building equipped with the latest earthquake resistance structure and in-house power generation and stands on a stable foundation," said a spokesman for <span class="companylink">Kirin Brewery Co</span>., one of the units in the new facility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the high vacancy rate, new developments hitting the market with the most-advanced quake-resistant designs are enjoying strong demand. In the Shibuya area, known for its maze of youth-oriented shopping streets, <span class="companylink">Sumitomo Realty &amp; Development Co</span>., in June opened the 639,000-square-foot Shibuya Garden Tower 100% pre-leased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Mitsubishi Estate</span>, an affiliate of the broader group of <span class="companylink">Mitsubishi</span> companies, is recycling its building stock, partly to keep upgrading it with the latest quake-resistant structures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After redeveloping 30% of its properties in the Marunouchi area from 2002 to 2010, <span class="companylink">Mitsubishi Estate</span> plans new buildings for another 35% of its sites there by 2020.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Robbie Whelan   </div><div>762 words</div><div>7 November 2012</div><div>10:00</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans are setting up house at the fastest rate in more than six years, an indication that recession anxiety, which prompted adult children to move in with their parents and single people to postpone marriage, is starting to ease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation added 1.15 million households in the 12 months that ended in September, according to the most recent Census Bureau data. That is a significant rise from the past four years when an average of 650,000 households were formed annually. While what economists call "household formation" is running a little lower than the average 1.25 million added annually during the boom years, the latest data nevertheless represent an important shift.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising household formation, which is tied to employment growth, means more students are finding jobs when they leave college, more adult children are leaving their parents' homes and more couples feel confident enough about the future to tie the knot. It could also mean that immigration is picking up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"During the recession, a lot of those major life events like marriage, children and migration were put on hold," said Kenneth Johnson, a senior demographer at the University of New Hampshire's Carsey Institute. "It may be that there are couples who are thinking about living together, and they're thinking, 'The jobs picture is getting better. It's time to make the next step.' "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is what happened with Imran Akram, a patent inspector for the U.S. government, and his wife, Salmah Rizvi, who works for the Defense Department. The couple, who married in September, recently closed on their first home, a $250,000 condominium in Baltimore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Akram, who is 29 years old, and Ms. Rizvi, who is 26, say they wanted to buy a condo as soon as possible after their wedding. They plan to live there for at least a year and then rent it out if Ms. Rizvi decides to go to law school and they move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At least here in Baltimore, purchase prices are still low, but rents are pretty high, because everyone's scared to buy," Mr. Akram said. "We're both employed and we both feel secure with our jobs. We also feel like the housing market is on an upward swing. Prices are still depressed, but they're probably going up."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While young home buyers represent one source of new households, the overall growth is due mainly to renters, many of them recent college graduates. The number of homes lived in by renters has grown by more than five million since 2006 to 39.6 million. During the same period, the number of homes lived in by owners fell 1.4 million to 75.1 million as many properties slipped into foreclosure or became vacant for other reasons. But the number of owner-occupied units is starting to rise again as buyers emerge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arielle Wolfson, 23, moved out of her parents' house in Denville, N.J., in July, after accepting a job at a financial-services consultancy in Denver. She had moved back home after graduating from the <span class="companylink">University of Pennsylvania</span> in May, but now rents an apartment with a roommate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Wolfson said if she hadn't found a job, she would be living at home, "with my mom still telling me to clean my room and pestering me" about finding work. "I spent the whole springtime of my senior year applying to maybe 50 or 60 jobs. Obviously the job prospects for recent graduates are grim, but the jobs are there. It's just a competitive market," she said. "If you search hard enough, you'll get something."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in household formation is good news for home builders, who are betting that many people will prefer buying a new place to renting an apartment. The Commerce Department reported that builders started work on homes at an annual rate of 872,000 housing units in October, the highest level of housing starts in four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In the depths of the recession, three households would turn into one.…We've been waiting for this unbundling to happen," said Ara Hovnanian, chief executive of <span class="companylink">Hovnanian Enterprises Inc</span>., one of the nation's largest builders of single-family homes. "Demographics is destiny, in the end."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos </div><div>464 words</div><div>7 November 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> reported a $2.9 billion third-quarter profit on Tuesday, offering the latest evidence that the company has turned the corner after several years of large losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The profit compares with a year-earlier loss of $4.4 billion and marks the fourth consecutive quarterly gain for the mortgage-finance company. Freddie's fortunes have improved as home prices have stabilized amid stronger housing demand and low inventories of homes for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Freddie and its larger sibling, <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, also have tightened up mortgage-credit standards over the past four years. Risky loans that the companies purchased from 2005 to 2008 as the housing boom turned to bust have gradually been replaced with better-quality loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company's stronger performance "was driven by favorable market conditions, including the continued improvement in the housing market, as well as our ongoing efforts to minimize losses on our legacy book," said Donald Layton, Freddie's chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Freddie will make a $1.8 billion dividend payment to the <span class="companylink">U.S. Treasury</span>, which took over Freddie and Fannie four years ago through a legal process known as conservatorship. It is the second straight quarter in which Freddie hasn't needed any federal assistance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The companies have taken nearly $187 billion of aid and returned around $47 billion of dividends, leaving taxpayers with a $140 billion loss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fannie, which hasn't yet reported third-quarter figures, posted a $5.1 billion second-quarter profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beginning next year, the Treasury will take all the companies' profits as a dividend payment, replacing the current structure, which requires the firms to pay a 10% dividend on the senior preferred shares that the government has taken in exchange for bailing them out. The companies have had to make those payments even in quarters when they lose money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices through September rose by 4.3% from one year ago, Freddie said on Tuesday. That marks the largest year-over-year gain in six years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising home prices are boosting Freddie's bottom lines because the company is losing less money on homes that go through foreclosure. Freddie lost around 36 cents for every $1 of debt that went through foreclosure during the third quarter, compared with nearly 42 cents one year ago. The improvement was even stronger in hard-hit Arizona, where the company lost 36 cents for every $1 that it foreclosed on, compared with 49 cents one year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Freddie increased its reserves for credit losses by $650 million, compared with an increase of $177 million in the second quarter and $3.6 billion in the year-ago period.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Stefanos Chen </div><div>1003 words</div><div>2 November 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M7</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent evening, a crowd of real-estate brokers, cocktails in hand, gathered at 225 Rector Place in Manhattan to toast the evening's honored guest: celebrity interior designer and TV personality Jonathan Adler, who had recently staged two model apartments in the building with his name-brand line of furnishings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The party was also something of a relaunch for the building, located in Battery Park City, by the current developer, Related Cos. A previous condo-conversion attempt had flopped in 2009 after another developer defaulted on its debts. But Related recently announced that about 50% of the apartments have sold since sales reopened in June -- thanks, in part, they said, to Mr. Adler's involvement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the real-estate industry continues to rebound from the downturn, developers are finding that celebrity names offer a competitive edge in the luxury market. And while star branding certainly isn't new, developers these days are increasingly bringing in "big names" for the little stuff -- the details that often sell apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Miami, musician, actor and, in recent years, interior designer Lenny Kravitz created some of the new interior looks at Paramount Bay. Designer Victoria Hagan recently collaborated on interiors of Philip House on New York's Upper East Side. And chef Eric Ripert, owner of the Michelin-rated Le Bernardin and a frequent TV personality, is involved with a planned condominium in the city's Chelsea neighborhood slated for completion in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's the starchitect revival," says Jonathan Miller, president at Miller Samuel Real Estate Appraisers &amp; Consultants, who recalls the rise of residential buildings by celebrity architects and designers during the last housing boom. By 2004, name-dropping at new luxury developments was almost a given, he said. Celebrity collaborations fell off when the housing market plunged, but they're now beginning to return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For developers, celebrity connections can affect both the pace and price of listings, according to one study. In a survey of 17 markets in the U.S. and abroad, "branded" residential developments -- those with hotel-like amenities where recognizable designers often played a large role -- commanded 31% higher sales prices per square foot than comparable nonbranded projects. In New York, the premium is 12.4%, and in Miami it's 19.6%, according to the research by Knight Frank, a London-based real-estate consultancy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People will pay a premium for a recognized brand -- it's a safer option," said Liam Bailey, head of residential research for Knight Frank, which will release the findings Friday. That's especially true for foreign buyers, Mr. Bailey said, many of whom make their purchases from overseas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign investment helped sales at Paramount Bay in Miami, said Anthony Burns of <span class="companylink">iStar Financial</span>, part of the current development team. The luxury waterfront condo project broke ground in 2006, but remained unfinished and vacant until work on the high-rise tower picked up in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Securing someone who could deliver great design was important, he said, but getting a talent that could deliver "on the public-relations front overnight really drove that decision."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kravitz Design, Mr. Kravitz's design company, came on board in spring 2011, furnishing three model apartments and overhauling common areas. Mr. Kravitz, known for retro-inspired rock songs like "Are You Gonna Go My Way," founded the design company in 2003 with a focus on luxury interiors. Mr. Burns, the developer, likens Mr. Kravitz's work to "an urban oasis," with an emphasis on "cool but livable" design. Since sales started in October 2011, about 85% of the building's 346 residential units have been sold, Mr. Burns said. One of the three model apartments, including furnishings, was also sold. Mr. Kravitz was unavailable for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At the end of the day in South Florida, everything is 'ocean this' and 'ocean that,'" said Peter Zalewski of Florida real-estate firm Condo Vultures. "Now suddenly if there's a brand or name you like, you're more inclined to buy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the developer of Devonshire House in New York's Greenwich Village brought in Ms. Hagan around 2009, the project was "dead," says Susan Hewitt of the Cheshire Group. <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span>'s collapse was still fresh in buyers' minds, and "we felt we needed to sell something that was more special," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Hagan, who has been named one of Architectural Digest's "Top 100" designers, oversaw everything from crown moldings and finishes in the apartments to common-area design features. The developer sold its publicly offered inventory of 48 units in six months, Ms. Hewitt said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project's success led to another collaboration with Ms. Hagan, this time on Philip House on the Upper East Side, a prewar condo conversion with prices topping out at $8.25 million for a five-bedroom, 3,795-square-foot apartment. Sales began in September but Ms. Hewitt says they're on pace to match Devonshire's sales rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think for years designers have been working on these types of projects" Ms. Hagan said. "What's changed is the developers are listening a bit more and paying attention to details."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Details are what compelled Alfa Development to collaborate with Mr. Ripert, the chef, on a condominium in Chelsea slated to open in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chelsea Green, a 14-story, 51-unit building being marketed as a high-efficiency green building, will come standard with the "Eric Ripert Kitchen by Poggenpohl," which includes an induction range top and a layout designed for entertaining guests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales began in May, based entirely off plans, and the developer says all but three units have sold -- two two-bedroom apartments in the $2 million range, and a more than $8 million penthouse. Mr. Ripert said he has purchased his own unit in the building.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Dawn Wotapka </div><div>1242 words</div><div>2 November 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans lured by the fantasy of owning a private island don't have to go far asea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the sunny Florida Keys up the chilly Canadian coast, values of private islands off the coast of North America have tumbled an estimated 25% or more since the housing downfall, real-estate experts say. Now, prices are starting to attract buyers again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are small signs of a recovery," says Farhad Vladi, president of Vladi Private Islands, a global brokerage based in Hamburg, Germany, that he started 35 years ago. "We have inquiries and that was not so much the case last year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far this year, Mr. Vladi has sold 50 islands across North America. That's up from 10 in all of 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are roughly 21,000 named islands in the U.S., though some are too small for habitation and others too marshy for development, according to the <span class="companylink">U.S. Geological Survey</span>. Canada also has about 21,000 named islands with scores of unnamed ones, according to <span class="companylink">Natural Resources Canada</span>, a government agency. Islands that are developed or have the building permits in place that allow developments are the most desirable, as are those with deep-water access.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September, a buyer paid $950,000 -- a 27% discount off the listing price -- for the two Lower Birch Islands, which span nearly 30 acres in Addison, Maine. The larger island features a three-bedroom, post-and-beam home that uses solar power. In Nova Scotia, the 77-acre Gravel Island, which features a rustic log cabin relying on well water, recently sold for about $400,000, slightly above the asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Islands that don't already have building permits can be a hard sell, as William Scherer is learning. In 1983, his father purchased 47 undeveloped acres with picturesque views located just south of Duck Key in the Florida Keys for $400,000. Because the two islands, known as Tom's Harbor Keys, don't include building permits, he recently listed them for $1.5 million, well below the $10 million he estimates he could command otherwise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's unlikely the buyer could get any permits easily. To protect the local habitat, which, includes coral reefs, receiving permission to build in the Keys is complicated, competitive and can take a decade or more. Florida allots the area just 255 annual building permits, and requests are primarily judged on environmental sensitivity, said Christine Hurley, Monroe County's growth-management division director.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given their location in a federally protected area, the Tom's Harbor islands can't be linked to water, sewer or electrical systems. With no flood insurance or a federally backed mortgage possible, "the owner would be challenged and he'd need to have all cash," Ms. Hurley said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For islands that can be developed, advances in technology have made it easier and more affordable to generate power, filter water and connect with the outside world. Manufactured housing, long been associated with flimsy trailers, is increasingly popular as the designs look more like a traditional weekend home or vacation cottage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Ling Graves, president of Hilton Head, S.C.-based Graves Construction Co., estimates that building on a private island costs 40% more than the mainland because manpower and materials have to cross the water. A simple cabin could cost about $100 a square foot, while a high-end custom abode would cost much more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because bringing power lines to an island is expensive and requires government permits, Mr. Graves advises using a generator for electricity, requiring about $20,000 for an average home. Expect to spend between $6,000 and $8,000 to install a well for water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Island construction requires meticulous planning: There won't be any quick trips to the hardware store. "If you forget about it, you've definitely lost a day," he said. "When you're remote, you're remote."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bob Rainek of Milwaukee has listed three small islands in the Keys. Two of the islands include homes, while the third comes with a docked houseboat. Mr. Rainek, a 63-year-old real-estate investor, says he loves spending time on his islands. "I personally get the feeling of being very unstressed," he says, adding he often catches fish and lobster for dinner. "You have the ultimate waterfront property. Never a day goes by where we don't see dolphins jumping outside our windows."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rainek paid $250,000 for his first island 20 years ago, the same price he paid for a second island a decade ago. He hopes they'll sell for around $1 million each. He also aims to nearly double his money on island No. 3, for which he paid $800,000 five years ago. Mr. Rainek says he's looking to retire and give back to the world, possibly by spending time doing humanitarian work in Sudan and Congo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Potential buyers of private islands generally tend to be wealthy, value privacy, like nature and enjoy boating and other water-related activities. Men are big shoppers, brokers say. For some, owning an island is the ultimate sign of success, one that carries big bragging rights. "It's like the endgame toy," says Chris Krolow, chief executive of Private Islands Inc., a global island brokerage based in Toronto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Listings website Realtor.com has 460 listings that include an island, with 205 that feature a home. The median price is $950,000, with the cheapest listing, $119,900, in Milan, N.H. At $29.5 million, Little Bokeelia Island south of St. Petersburg, Fla., is the priciest. Mr. Krolow has more than 220 for sale in North America, up from 190 a year ago. He has 60 islands available in Ontario, 28 in Florida and 15 in Maine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Vladi urges would-be buyers to start by renting. Then, once they've identified a particular island, he suggests spending time with the mainland locals, who often form a close-knit society. Shoppers should also scope out medical care, which should be within a 90-minute radius of the island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Check out the plants and animals on the island. "Do you like the flowers? Do you hate snakes? Are there too many mosquitoes?" he says. "You can only find that out if you are there."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While there is no guarantee island values won't fall further, the market is "coming back stronger because prices are more in line with what they should be," Mr. Krolow said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. manufacturing sector expanded last month, but employment weakened, according to data released Thursday by the Institute for Supply Management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM's manufacturing purchasing managers' index was little changed at 51.7 in October from 51.5 in September. A reading above 50 indicates expansion. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires expected the October PMI to come in at 51.0.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Comments from the panel this month reflect continued concern over a fragile global economy and soft orders across several manufacturing sectors," the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The October ISM report follows other weak factory surveys for the month. Earlier Thursday, data provider Markit said its own factory index fell to a 37-month low in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM indexes were generally mixed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand improved, although the global slowdown hobbled exports. The new-orders index rose to 54.2 from 52.3 in September. The exports index remained in contraction at 48.0 from 48.5.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The production index expanded after two months of contraction, rising to 52.4 from 49.5. The employment index slipped to 52.1 from 54.7.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturers reported a small easing in cost pressures. The ISM's prices index slowed to 55.0 from 58.0.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, spending on construction projects rose in September as home building jumped, offsetting declines in commercial and government outlays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction spending increased 0.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $851.56 billion, the Commerce Department said. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires expected a 0.5% increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gain, the fifth in the past six months, comes after August building slipped 0.1% to $846.17 billion, according to revised data, compared with an initially reported 0.6% monthly decrease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private residential construction increased 2.8% to $285.86 billion, its highest level since December 2008. September spending on private home building was 20.9% higher than a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home building and renovations were an important driver of economic growth in the third quarter. Residential fixed investment has contributed to the gross domestic product for six consecutive quarters after being a drag during the housing bust and financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the data showed private nonresidential construction—which includes spending on offices, manufacturing and transportation—fell 0.1% to $294.61 billion in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business investment in building contracted in the third quarter for the first time since early 2011, the Commerce Department's GDP report showed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total private-sector construction spending increased 1.3% in September, according to Thursday's data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Public-sector construction fell 0.8% to $271.10 billion during the month to its lowest level since December 2006. Governments spent less on roads, schools and offices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal construction was down 6.2%, and state and local spending fell 0.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, U.S. consumer confidence rose in October to its highest reading since early 2008, according to a report released Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span>, a private research group, said its index of consumer confidence increased to 72.2 last month from a revised 68.4 in September, which originally had been reported as a more optimistic 70.3.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest index is just below the 73.0 expected by economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires but is the highest confidence reading since February 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Consumers were considerably more positive in their assessment of current conditions, with the improvements in the job market as the major driver," said Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The board usually publishes its confidence report on the last Tuesday of the month, but the October report was delayed until Thursday because of superstorm Sandy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span>'s report, the present-situation index, a gauge of consumers' assessment of current economic conditions, advanced to 56.2 from a revised 48.7, first reported as 50.2.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer expectations for economic activity over the next six months edged up to 82.9 from a revised 81.5, originally put at 83.7.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers were more upbeat about current labor-market conditions, which is a positive indicator for the October payrolls report scheduled for Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The board's survey showed 10.3% of respondents now think jobs are "plentiful." That is up from 8.1% in September and the highest reading in at least a year. Another 39.4% think jobs are "hard to get," down from 40.7% last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers' expectations about future job markets are mixed. The results show that 19.2% think there will be more jobs in the next six months, up from 18.1% in September. But 20.3% think there will be fewer jobs, up from 18.7% in September.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. factory sector expanded modestly last month but producers remain cautious about hiring and face a sustained slump in exports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management said Thursday that its closely watched index ticked up to 51.7 in October from 51.5 a month earlier. The index is based on a survey of purchasing managers who order everything for factories from raw materials to light bulbs. Readings over 50 indicate growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upturn shows manufacturers shifting from a summer lull, when the index contracted for three consecutive months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, manufacturing data from around the world continued to paint a picture of contraction and slow growth. An official purchasing managers' index from China just barely moved back into expansionary territory last month, but a private measure produced by <span class="companylink">HSBC</span> and Markit still indicated contraction. Meanwhile, the factory sectors in Japan and South Korea continued to shrink. Much of Europe won't report manufacturing data until Friday, but indexes in the U.K., Austria and the Netherlands showed shrinking manufacturing sectors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. factories are being helped by spending by American consumers, who appear to be gaining confidence in the economy as more people get jobs, incomes gradually rise and rising home sales slowly lift property values. The Conference Board said Thursday that its index of consumer confidence rose to a four-and-a-half-year high of 72.2 in October, up from 68.4 in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those reports, along with others Thursday, hint at some momentum in the U.S. recovery. Payroll firm <span class="companylink">Automatic Data Processing Inc</span>. said its newly revamped survey showed the economy added 158,000 private-sector jobs in October, a solid if not sterling clip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meantime, the number of American workers filing first-time claims for unemployment benefits fell by 9,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 363,000, the Labor Department said, indicating that layoffs are slowing. The four-week moving average, which smooths out weekly volatility, also fell, to 367,250.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The manufacturing report provided a small dose of relief as it showed that overall demand in the U.S. remains stable compared with economies around the globe, particularly in recession-ravaged Europe. But the report also contained red flags, showing that businesses are hunkering down and that global economic troubles continue to hurt U.S. exports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps most promising was a measure of new orders, which rose nearly two percentage points to 54.2. Such an increase usually means that demand is rising and that factories will need to boost production in coming months. That already has happened, with the gauge for production rising 2.9 percentage points to 52.4.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the industry growth came from only eight of 18 sectors—mainly those tied to consumer goods, such as furniture, apparel and food. Factories that generally serve business customers—makers of machinery, electrical equipment and transportation equipment—reported declines in business. That suggests that companies are holding off on purchases of big-ticket items amid growing uncertainty about the global economy and in the U.S., said Brad Holcomb, who oversees the ISM manufacturing survey. The report showed that a measure of exports slipped half a point to 48.0, while another gauge, which measures hiring, slowed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Holcomb said manufacturers might see a boost in demand in coming months as communities start repairing storm damage from Sandy, but that the overall outlook is uncertain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economist Paul Dales of Capital Economics said the outlook for manufacturers remains "bleak." "Our view that the global economy will remain weak next year implies that manufacturers will continue to struggle," Mr. Dales wrote in a note to clients. "But there is no reason why the housing recovery can't continue to strengthen at the same time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pickup in the housing market is leading to higher construction spending as companies build homes to meet stronger demand. Construction spending rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $851.6 billion in September, a rise of 0.6% from a month earlier and 7.8% from a year ago, the Commerce Department said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market continued to gain steam in August, with new data showing that home-price increases accelerated over the month while also spreading to more cities across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller 20-city home-price index rose 2.0% in August from a year earlier, an acceleration from the 1.2% annual increase in July and the fastest pace in two years, according to a report released Tuesday. Prices were up in 17 of the 20 metropolitan areas tracked by the index, compared with 16 in the report for July and three for January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing recovery -- which is being driven by a combination of rising demand, declining inventory and low interest rates -- has been a bright spot in a sluggish economy still trying to find its footing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday's report was encouraging to economists because continued and accelerating price growth, at a time when prices gains are usually slowing down after the peak summer sales season, suggests the housing recovery has become self-reinforcing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is a real recovery with legs," said Ellen Zentner, an economist at Nomura Securities. "What's especially encouraging is that price gains are deepening across the country."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though closely followed by economists and the markets, the Case-Shiller index is a lagging indicator of values -- a moving average now two months old. Still, other home-value and home-price indicators suggest price gains have continued into September and October -- a possible explanation for why consumer sentiment, though low by historical standards, continues to improve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market has recovered largely thanks to the declining number of foreclosures, bank sales and other "distressed" homes that sell at big discounts and drag down prices.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, with inventory dwindling and household incomes still under pressure, economists caution that price gains will soon flatten out if job and income growth don't pick up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price gains generally have been stronger in markets that were hit hard by the housing bust. Leading the pack was Phoenix, where prices were up 18.8% from a year earlier. Detroit, Minneapolis and Miami all posted year-to-year gains above 6%.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some investors are sticking to their bullish bets on home builders, despite a number of warnings from Wall Street analysts that the massive rally in the stocks is overdone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The optimists say they believe the recovery of the U.S. housing market still is in its initial phase, leaving plenty of room for the stocks to keep rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gains so far have been startling. <span class="companylink">PulteGroup Inc</span>., the largest U.S. home builder by revenue, is up 214% in the past 12 months, when new-home sales began rising consistently. It also is the best performer in the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index over the past year. <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>., the third-largest U.S. home builder by revenue, is up 117% in 12 months. In the same period, the S&amp;P 500 is up 10%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home sales tend to move higher over a five-year cycle, and this is year one," says Kirk Mentzer, director of investment research with Huntington Asset Advisors, a $14 billion fund in Columbus, Ohio. "There's still a ways to go, even if the rise from here is just half of the current rally." The firm bought <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton Inc</span>., a home builder in Fort Worth, Texas, at the end of 2011, and is hanging on even after a 71% run-up this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data in recent months have indicated the pace of recovery has accelerated. New-home sales jumped 5.7% in September to their highest level in over two years. The Commerce Department said recently that housing starts had risen to 872,000, the highest seasonally adjusted annual rate in four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors are more optimistic about the housing sector than they are about the broader economy, in part because of the recent action by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> to further bolster the market by purchasing mortgage-backed securities. Both analysts and investors expect the housing market to continue to improve, though they note that if the recovery comes to a halt, shares of companies sensitive to the housing market -- including those of builders -- are likely to sell off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors have poured $653.7 million into the iShares <span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> U.S. Home Construction Index Fund so far in 2012, putting it in the top 5% of exchange-traded funds in terms of inflows, according to Morningstar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And home builders have shown resilience during the recent swoon in the broader market. The <span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> U.S. Home Construction Index has lost 0.5% over the past two weeks, compared with a 3.3% drop for the S&amp;P 500</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mentzer and other bullish investors point to history to bolster their position. During the housing upturn from 2001 through the end of 2005, shares of custom builder <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> surged 357%. Since September 2011, they are up a relatively modest 145%. And because the housing-market slump of recent years was the most severe on record, there is more room for home-builder shares to rise this time around, investors say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sorin Roibu, a housing analyst for money manager Turner Investment Partners, which oversees nearly $12 billion, believes with the labor market in the U.S. still slack, home builders will have an easier time managing costs in the current upswing. He expects bigger margins as a result.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also says investors shouldn't underestimate the power of market sentiment, especially at a time when technology and other sectors are facing headwinds. "If you look at home-building stocks, they're the best direct play on the U.S. housing recovery, and everybody wants to play it," Mr. Roibu says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The magnitude of the stock gains has elicited heavy skepticism on Wall Street, where analysts typically are seen as cheerleaders for stocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Megan McGrath, executive director and home-building analyst at brokerage MKM Partners, this month downgraded <span class="companylink">Ryland Group</span>, a major builder on the West Coast, to sell, and cut her ratings on <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span> and <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> to neutral.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You can still be bullish on housing but not necessarily the home-builder stocks," Ms. McGrath says. "We're still in the early stages of recovery, but these stocks are up around 150% in a year, so we thought, look, if you've made the trade and you've made some money, maybe it's time to take some profits."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Jack Micenko believes shares have become too expensive. Mr. Micenko says that for shares to warrant their current valuations, the U.S. will need to build an average of 2.6 million new single-family homes a year from 2013 through 2016. During the peak of new-home construction in 2006, the U.S. built 1.6 million new single-family homes. He has a negative outlook on the group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But today's annual rate of 872,000 homes is still well short of the norm over the past half century. On average, builders have started construction on about 1.5 million new homes a year since 1959.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist with <span class="companylink">Janney Montgomery Scott LLC</span>, argues that the current level of new-home sales is so low that there still is nowhere for home builders to go but up. "At the end of the day, homes are being sold at an appallingly low rate. . . . That still bodes well for home builders," he said. The firm, which oversees $55 billion in its Parker/Hunter Asset Management arm, is keeping its position in the <span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> U.S. Home Construction Index steady.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jason Zweig </div><div>790 words</div><div>27 October 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate is red-hot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Funds specializing in real-estate investment trusts, or REITs, have taken in $10.9 billion in new money this year through Sept. 30, according to Morningstar, the financial-research firm. That is more than REIT funds took in for all of 2010 and 2011 combined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Desperate for income, investors can't get enough high-yielding REITs -- and Wall Street is rushing to supply them. Companies are lining up to convert into REITs, a step that requires approval from the <span class="companylink">Internal Revenue Service</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the market is changing -- and investors should temper their expectations accordingly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs must prove to the IRS that their main business is investing in real estate. They also must pay out no less than 90% of their taxable income as dividends; as a result, REITs generally don't owe federal income tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With REITs yield almost 4%, it's no wonder yield-parched investors are lapping them up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And no wonder companies that aren't REITs want to be. In the pipeline for conversion: <span class="companylink">Cincinnati Bell</span>'s subsidiary <span class="companylink">CyrusOne</span>, <span class="companylink">Corrections Corp. of America</span>, <span class="companylink">Crown Castle International</span>, Equinix, Geo Group, Iron Mountain, <span class="companylink">Lamar Advertising</span>, and <span class="companylink">SBA Communications</span>. These companies operate cloud-computing data centers, cellphone towers, prisons, billboards and document-storage facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Kirby, director of research at Green Street Advisors, a research firm in Newport Beach, Calif., says the pending conversions are "a bit of a stretch" from the most familiar forms of real estate held by REITs: office, industrial, residential and retail properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The companies cite the potential for tax savings, increased dividends and higher stock valuations. Iron Mountain, for example, estimates it could save up to $130 million on taxes annually and roughly double its dividend. The move "is the best approach to execute our real-estate business and related capital-allocation strategies," the company said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On average, says Ross Smotrich, a REIT analyst at <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>, these stocks have popped roughly 40% since the companies started discussing conversion to REIT status.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Says Jeff Middleswart, president of Behind the Numbers, a Dallas-based research firm: "REITs are hot, so people are trying to convert things that aren't hot into REITs."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American Tower, a cell-tower firm, converted last Dec. 31 and is up more than 20% since, versus 14% for the average REIT stock. On the other hand, Weyerhaeuser, the timber company, switched in 2010 and has gained nearly 50% this year -- but remains below its price five years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott Westphal, an analyst at <span class="companylink">Cornerstone Real Estate Advisers</span> in Stamford, Conn., says 10 to 20 companies could convert to REITs in the next several years. "There will be some great opportunities coming in," he says. "Unfortunately, some of these sectors have a checkered past."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prisons, cell towers and golf courses were turned into REITs in the late 1990s, Mr. Westphal says -- with "pretty dreadful" results that in some cases produced losses of 90% or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Corrections Corp</span>. did a REIT conversion once before, in 1999, at more than $70 per share. By 2000, the stock was below $1 and the conversion was reversed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company said this year that its pending REIT conversion could provide "a more tax-efficient structure with higher cash flow."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The key question," says Mr. Smotrich of <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>, "is whether these conversions will have the strength in the underlying business that will support the [stock prices] they're hoping for."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For investors, REITs can reduce the risks of a stock-and-bond portfolio and protect against the ravages of inflation. Because they own properties whose values don't move in sync with housing, REITs are a hedge against declining home values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best way to own REITs is through a low-cost index or exchange-traded fund that spans all real-estate sectors and geographic areas, like the Vanguard REIT ETF or the SPDR Dow Jones REIT ETF. The indexes the funds track are unlikely to add REIT conversions soon, analysts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While owning REITs is a good idea, panic buying isn't. Many investors are dumping money-market funds or bond funds and replacing them with higher-yielding REITs, says Morningstar analyst Michael Rawson. But REITs aren't bonds; the FTSE NAREIT Equity REITs Index, a benchmark of more than 120 of these stocks, lost 37.7% in 2008, when <span class="companylink">U.S. Treasury</span> bonds had a positive 13.7% return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why plunge in with both feet when you can tiptoe in? It's wiser to buy over time rather than all at once.</p>

</p><div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">U.S. News: High Costs Bedevil Builders --- Shortages of Lumber, Land and Labor Push Up Prices of New-Home Construction</span>
</div><div class="author">By Robbie Whelan </div><div>950 words</div><div>26 October 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home construction has picked up momentum in recent months after years of contraction. But the industry is facing a fresh challenge: building costs are going through the roof.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders are seeing the prices of materials, labor and land rise due to shortages and reduced capacity among manufacturers, subcontractors and developers. Some industry veterans say the price increases could be temporary, noting that supply-demand imbalances often occur early in a recovery. That happens in part because the industries that fuel the engines of the construction trade are wary about ramping up until they are sure the recovery is sustainable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But rising costs mean many builders will try to pass along price increases to consumers. If too many potential new-home buyers opt instead for an older home, that could have implications for the economy. Sales of new homes provide a much bigger lift to economic growth than sales of older ones. The <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> estimates that each new home built generates about three new jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If somebody buys a new home, you've got to hire a bunch of construction workers to go build it," said Michael Hanson, senior U.S. economist with <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, senior U.S. economist with <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span>. If fewer new homes sell, he said, "that would mean less of a boost" to gross domestic product.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Census Bureau reported Wednesday that the median price of a new home was $242,400 in September, up 11.5% from a year ago. The median price of an existing home was $183,900 in September, up 11.3% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cost of framing lumber, which makes up nearly one-sixth of the total construction cost of a home, has risen 21% in the past year. Makers of drywall, which is used to build interior walls, have boosted prices 25% since January and signaled more increases to come early next year. In addition, builders are paying more for land and labor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Builders have their backs against the wall," said Robert Denk, senior economist at the NAHB. In a market that has just begun to recover, "it's a very difficult time for builders to try and pass on costs to consumers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet some builders are doing just that. Carmeter and Curtis Lard started shopping for a new house in June, hoping to find a three-bedroom in Otay Ranch, a suburb of San Diego with good schools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first home that caught their interest was built by McMillin Homes and was selling for $401,000 -- the top end of their price range. Three weeks later, after the couple had qualified for a mortgage, the same model was selling for $418,000. The couple visited several other new-home communities but couldn't find anything in their price range and gave up in August. Now, they are shopping for an older home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"By the time we were qualified, the house was out of reach," Ms. Lard said. "We didn't realize it would be that difficult to buy here."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Timber companies and drywall manufacturers, for example, laid off thousands of workers and idled capacity at plants when the downturn hit and want to see at least six months of rising demand before reversing course. (Lumber shortages are also the result of an infestation of bark beetles that has destroyed millions of acres of pine trees in the U.S. and Canada.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through the first half of 2012, the lumber available to U.S. builders measured 18.2 billion board feet, down about 45% from the peak of production in 2005. Shawn Church, editor of Random Lengths, a trade publication that tracks the price of wood, said "production is coming back from the 2009 trough" of 16 billion board feet produced through the first half of that year, "but very slowly."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drywall manufacturers, in addition to raising prices, have stopped providing "job quotes," which allow builders and contractors to lock in at low prices with their suppliers, for projects that might last several years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Any time there's a price increase at the manufacturer level and we go to pass it along, we get a lot of questions from buyers," said Ira Horner, a manager at <span class="companylink">Kent Gypsum Supply Inc</span>., a drywall distributor in Kent, Wash. "As the price of materials goes up, it definitely is going to hurt the number of projects that take place."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Land also is in short supply, at least in the places where consumers want to live, near jobs and good schools. In Gilbert, Ariz., near Phoenix, builders including <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>., <span class="companylink">Shea Homes</span> and <span class="companylink">Meritage Homes Corp</span>. recently purchased 203 acres of raw land in a development called The Bridges, paying between $126,000 and $150,000 an acre. In the Spring of 2011, some investors were paying as little as $77,763 an acre for the same land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Labor is another problem. Between 2007 and 2011, more than 2.1 million construction workers lost their jobs and many switched to jobs in other industries. "These are folks who lost their jobs, waited around for years and then found something else," said Megan McGrath, a home builder analyst with MKM Partners. "The trick is getting the skilled labor force to come back."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That will be easy in some regions, but not everywhere. Jonathan Jaffe, <span class="companylink">Lennar</span>'s chief operating officer, said in a recent conference call that labor shortages are most acute in Phoenix, Texas and parts of Florida.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hong Kong's banking system is awash in cash, pushing lending rates down and threatening to push up property prices, as the de facto central bank continues to intervene in the currency market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span> has sold a combined 14.36 billion Hong Kong dollars (US$1.85 billion) in four interventions since Friday as it seeks to keep the currency from strengthening out of its trading band against the U.S. dollar. The HKMA said Wednesday it expects funds will continue to flow into the Hong Kong dollar on a net basis "for some time" and pledged to maintain the currency's stability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash has surged into the banking system from the intervention, and as overseas fund managers, more willing to take on risk as a result of global stimulus measures, snap up the city's stocks. As a result, Hong Kong's benchmark three-month interbank lending rate has fallen to 0.25%, from 0.35% before the first intervention, and 0.5% two weeks ago. When that rate falls, it brings down benchmark borrowing rates for companies, and mortgage rates for individuals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Barclays</span> said that if interest rates remain low, there likely will be more lending, which would support the property market. The city's housing prices have already risen 16% from the start of the year through to August. When borrowing rates fell from 4% to below 1% in 2009, home prices jumped 29%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, "the rates drop hasn't been drastic, and its impact to the financial market wouldn't be as substantial as it was during 2008-2009," said Tommy Ong, head of wealth-management solutions at <span class="companylink">DBS Group Holdings Ltd</span>.'s Hong Kong unit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A measure of liquidity among banks in Hong Kong, the so-called aggregate balance, has climbed to HK$163 billion, from around HK$149 billion before the intervention Friday. The last time the HKMA intervened was in 2008 and 2009, when the Hong Kong dollar was seen as a haven during market turmoil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Eddie Yue, deputy chief executive of the HKMA, said Wednesday that the U.S. stimulus measures announced in September may trigger demand for Asian currencies, equities and bonds. Some investors who have held U.S. dollars are switching back to the local unit as investors world-wide become more willing to take on risk, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time, the HKMA has been mostly stepping in during the U.S. day, when trading volume is less, making it easier for speculators to move the market. The Hong Kong dollar is allowed to trade between HK$7.7500 and HK$7.8500 per U.S. dollar. Late Wednesday in Hong Kong, the rate was HK$7.7505.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One-year forward contracts for Hong Kong dollars were priced at HK$7.7440 per dollar late Wednesday, a level beyond the strong end of the trading band. Still, few are predicting any quick change to the peg, which was created in 1983 as confidence in the former British colony wavered ahead of its handover to China in 1997.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The cost of change is substantial, while the benefits are highly uncertain," said Robert Minikin, senior foreign-exchange strategist at <span class="companylink">Standard Chartered PLC</span>'s Hong Kong unit. "Any change to the peg will be long-delayed until the yuan becomes fully convertible."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Josh Barbanel   </div><div>527 words</div><div>25 October 2012</div><div>00:03</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bargain buyers were out in force in the Hamptons over the summer, turning the period into the strongest summer season for sales since 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But median prices fell by 10% during the third quarter compared with the year-earlier quarter, as sales of the most-expensive homes—mansions that often come with ocean-front bragging rights—lagged behind, according to new market reports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The highest price sale during the quarter was an $18.6 million sale of a house in Wainscott near the ocean. That was far below the peak price for the year—a $28.5 million ocean front house in Southampton Village sold by Marc Rowan, a co-founder of private-equity firm <span class="companylink">Apollo Global Management</span>. That sale closed in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Susan Breitenbach, a top-selling East End broker, said that since the third quarter ended Sept. 30, there have been "a lot of high-end people" looking at houses. She said that a spate of big deals, including some topping $20 million, would close before the end of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You are going to see a lot of properties trading during the last quarter," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market reports show that a sales rebound in the Hamptons that began earlier this year, especially among properties priced below $1 million on the South Fork, is still going strong. Those properties are often a cottage or small home, far from the beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said the rebound in deals sub-$1 million deals was driven by falling interest rates and declining prices as enticing properties pushed more below the $1 million level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the peak spring season, total sales of 539 were the highest for any quarter since 2007. In the latest quarter there were 405 sales recorded, the highest for the third quarter since 2006, according a market report prepared by Jonathan Miller, an appraiser and president of Miller Samuel Inc., for Prudential Douglas Elliman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a Hampton's home was $765,000 In the third quarter, down 10% from both the second quarter and the third quarter of 2011, Mr. Miller's report said. That was still 30% below the peak prices during the boom years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average price was $1.43 million, down 18% from the year-earlier third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gregory J. Heym, an economist who prepared Hamptons market reports for Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead Property, said that closings were likely to pick up toward the end of the year, as sellers rushed to complete deals before increased capital-gains tax rates scheduled to go into effect next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said that 60% of sales were below $1 million in the latest quarter compared with 57% during the same quarter last year. At the same time, there were 19 sales of $4 million or more compared with 23 in the year-earlier period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller said that as elsewhere inventory in the Hamptons has been falling, leading to the possibility that prices may rise in the months ahead, even without an improvement in the outlook for the economy.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Robbie Whelan   </div><div>512 words</div><div>25 October 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A5</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes jumped in September to their highest level in more than two years, the latest sign that the housing market is on firmer ground after a bruising five-year downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders were on pace to sell new single-family homes at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 389,000 units in September, the Commerce Department said Wednesday, up 5.7% from August, and 27.1% higher than September 2011's annualized pace of 306,000. The level is the highest since April 2010, when first-time home buyers were rushing to qualify for a tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a new home was $242,400 in September, up 11.5% from a year earlier, but down from $250,400 in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists pointed to the gains as a sign that the fundamentals of the economy are improving, as consumers become confident and the unemployment rate improves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"September's rise in new home sales is another sign that home buyers are becoming more willing and more able to splash out on a new home," wrote Paul Diggle, an economist with Capital Economics in London, in a research note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the gains, the home-building industry is still stuck in low gear compared with the average sales pace of 845,000 new homes a year reached between 1990 and 2006. New-home sales peaked in July 2005, when they hit an annual pace of nearly 1.4 million, and declined sharply before the financial crisis. Last year's level of 306,000 sales was the lowest on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Levels of activity in the new housing market remain quite weak by historic standards," wrote <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> economist Daniel Silver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another concern is the inventory of new homes for sale, which fell to an all-time low of 143,000 houses in August, and rose only slightly in September, to 145,000. At the current pace of sales, that represents a 4.5-month supply of homes, the lowest level of inventory since October 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response, builders have stepped up construction in recent months. The Commerce Department last week said housing starts had risen to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 872,000 new homes, the highest level in four years. Some economists warn that the building industry may be ramping up too quickly and getting ahead of consumer demand for new homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The improvement in demand for new homes may not rise sufficiently to justify the accelerating in construction activity in the past few months," Millan Mulraine, a strategist with <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span>, wrote Wednesday. "As a result, new home prices are likely to come under further pressure as some of the premium over existing homes (which continue to attract demand) is removed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">September's new-home sales rose in three of four U.S. regions. Sales grew 16.7% in the Northeast, 16.8% in the South and 3.9% in the West but dropped 37.3% in the Midwest.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Deal of the Week: Tech Boosts San Francisco</span>
</div><div class="author">By Eliot Brown </div><div>776 words</div><div>24 October 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A booming tech sector in San Francisco has made its office-building owners the envy of commercial real-estate industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now developers are starting to move in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houston-based Hines and office giant <span class="companylink">Boston Properties</span> announced they would partner to pay $185 million for a development site where the two companies plan a 1,070-foot office tower that would be the tallest building on the West Coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Transbay Tower just south of the city's financial district would be finished at the earliest by 2016. The venture hasn't decided whether it would build on speculation, meaning it would move forward without tenant commitments, said Paul Paradis, senior managing director at Hines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a great market that's very constrained for space," Mr. Paradis said. "We're very optimistic right now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the growing West Coast real-estate investment trust <span class="companylink">Kilroy Realty Corp</span>. said it has purchased a development site a block away at 350 Mission St., where it plans to develop a 27-story, 400,000-square-foot office tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With or without a tenant, the company plans to move ahead in coming months on the <span class="companylink">Skidmore Owings &amp; Merrill</span>-designed glass building, said John Kilroy Jr., chief executive. "We can beat everybody to market," Mr. Kilroy said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deals come as empty San Francisco offices have been filling up over the past two-plus years thanks to a social media and app-fueled recovery. Companies that didn't exist six years ago -- such as <span class="companylink">Dropbox Inc</span>. and room-rental service <span class="companylink">Airbnb Inc</span>. -- have recently leased tens of thousands of feet and are rapidly growing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rents have shot up 50% since their nadir in the first quarter of 2010, to an average of $50.36 a square foot, according to real-estate services firm <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle Inc</span>. Vacancy is down to 12.7% from 17.8% in mid-2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Competition for the space has been so fierce -- they're overbidding for offices and taking whatever they can," Julia Georgules, a research analyst at <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>, said of tech firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But so far, office development has been restrained in the city given that banks have been reluctant to lend for new buildings. Only one large speculative project is under way by <span class="companylink">Tishman Speyer Properties LP</span> and the asset management division of <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, many developers have been focused on converting old warehouses into the kind of hip offices sought by tech firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with vacancy falling steadily and technology companies expanding, developers believe there will be demand for new construction. "When the tide rises, all boats rise," Mort Zuckerman, <span class="companylink">Boston Properties</span>' chairman, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The site for the Transbay Tower is near an under-construction transportation hub known as the <span class="companylink">Transbay Transit Center</span>. Hines has been interested in the site for years and initially struck a deal before the downturn to buy in from the public Transbay Joint Powers Authority for $350 million. After the recession, it renegotiated that deal to the current $185 million price. Earlier this year, it tapped real-estate services firm Eastdil Secured LLC to search for an equity partner to buy the land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What isn't clear is whether the 1.4 million-square-foot development would attract technology companies, which seem to prefer older buildings with large, open floors. With banks in contraction mode, demand for the traditional skyscrapers in downtown San Francisco has lagged behind the more tech-heavy areas such as the South of Market neighborhood lately.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Paradis, of Hines, said while some may prefer that type of space, he has seen significant interest in the project from technology firms, as well as financial firms that have lease expirations in coming years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Kilroy's move to develop 350 Mission represents a shift for the company, which in 2010 and 2011 was one of the most aggressive acquirers of office buildings in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company is now focusing more on development, in large part because values for well-occupied buildings, known as "core" properties, have returned to near-peak levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We can't find core that is priced to our liking," Mr. Kilroy said. "The yields are so low."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The higher prices, in turn, have led more owners to sell. San Francisco saw more than $3.9 billion in sales of office buildings through the third quarter of 2012, up 58% from the same period in 2011, according to research firm <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics Inc</span>.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Esther Fung   </div><div>669 words</div><div>24 October 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHANGHAI -- A luxury apartment building that is one of the most visible casualties of China's high-end property bust is up for auction in the northeast city of Dalian, after a bank foreclosed on the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 48-floor Park Central was owned by a fund run by <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Asset Management</span>, which invested $80 million in the property. But the asset manager lost the property when U.K.-based lender <span class="companylink">Standard Chartered PLC</span>, which provided the majority of a roughly $140 million loan, foreclosed over the summer after sluggish sales put it in violation of loan covenants, according to people with knowledge of the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loss, which came after China tightened rules on buying luxury apartments, shows how exposed some European and U.S. investors are to Chinese real estate. Several potential investors have been offered the property, but no deal has been reached, the people said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Standard Chartered</span> and <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Asset Management</span>, a unit of <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co</span>., declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China recently has shown signs of revival in its property market, yet problems remain evident. Property developers such as <span class="companylink">Greentown China Holdings Ltd</span>. and <span class="companylink">SPG Land Holdings Ltd</span>. that had focused on high-end homes, have been offloading some of their assets to other developers as cash flow tightened due to government moves to cool the property market. In June, debt-laden Greentown China raised $657 million by selling stock and issuing convertible bonds to shareholder <span class="companylink">Wharf (Holdings) Ltd</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government moved in 2010 to slow construction of luxury housing -- through credit curbs, limits on buying multiple properties and higher down-payment requirements -- and sought to push developers toward building for first-time buyers and those upgrading to bigger homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like upwardly mobile Chinese, foreign investors have preferred luxury properties in China due to the higher margins they can fetch compared with the mass-market, cookie-cutter apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But skeptics warn that it will take years for the market to absorb an oversupply of fancy apartments and villas, many left empty by their investor buyers, and "ghost cities" of unoccupied blocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Around three to four years ago you could already see that the government was clamping down on the luxury sector, but some thought that the government was going to leave the top-tier residential sector untouched since it had nothing to do with the mass market. That was misguided," said one person with knowledge of the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overall level of foreclosure activity in China is unclear. There is little information in the country regarding the volume of distressed real-estate assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But high-end residential projects such as Park Central, one of the top buildings in seaside Dalian, have been among the hardest hit since China launched its property tightening campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Asset Management</span> took over Park Central during its construction as the market showed signs of froth. The company started a $600 million Greater China property fund in 2008 and invested in projects across the country, including in Beijing, Shanghai and Nanjing. Its projects elsewhere in China don't appear to be in distress, the people said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The units in Park Central haven't sold well since they went on the market in September 2011. In addition to the government tightening measures, the sales weakness was partly because the units were too big and costly, according to the people with knowledge of the matter and real-estate agents in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Standard Chartered</span> foreclosed on the property after <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> breached some loan covenants due to poor sales, said one person. <span class="companylink">CBRE Group</span>, the broker hired to market Park Central, is working with <span class="companylink">Standard Chartered</span> to seek potential buyers, the people said.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">College Housing Firms Aim Upscale</span>
</div><div class="author">By Dawn Wotapka  </div><div>878 words</div><div>24 October 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C10</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The communities surrounding college campuses have long been filled with houses catering to students who have tired of living in dorms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, public companies that operate student housing are trying to break into that market. In the past, companies like <span class="companylink">American Campus Communities Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Education Realty Trust Inc</span>. have mostly developed apartment buildings near colleges that offered students private rooms and bathrooms and a long list of amenities, including resort-style pools and tanning beds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days the companies have begun to build upscale houses with bedrooms clustered around gourmet kitchens and access to amenity-filled clubhouses. Known as cottage-style housing, the relatively new product is becoming popular with operators and students.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, there are 35 cottage communities with nearly 19,000 beds. An additional 18 are under way or in the works, with roughly 12,000 beds, said Wes Rogers, chief executive of Landmark Properties Inc., which has built roughly one-third of the cottages in the U.S. While cottage-style housing represents a small percentage of the nearly 500,000 beds controlled by the sector's top companies, industry watchers expect the bed count to increase as the product catches on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's sort of the next evolution of student housing," Mr. Rogers said. "You don't have neighbors above you like in a traditional dorm environment. You literally live in your own house."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers are building these properties to house an expanding student population: More than three million high-school students are expected to graduate annually until the 2018-19 academic year, well above the roughly 2.5 million graduating in 1993-1994, according to the Department of Education.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, universities don't have enough beds and much of the current supply, tall towers with communal bathrooms, has lost favor among the McMansion generation. Schools, many struggling with budget cuts, can't afford to build new dorms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Operators like cottages because the rooms typically command rents at least 10% higher than other off-campus housing. And students tend to like them: Landmark had waiting lists in half of its 16 communities this academic year. Its cottage product is 96% leased, compared with 93% for apartment-style housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some industry watchers fear students' increased attention to debt could be pushing them to cut costs by living at home. <span class="companylink">Education Realty</span> Trust, also known as EdR, surprised the industry this month when it reported an occupancy rate of 90.5% for this academic year, down from 94.7% a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rents increased 5.1%, possibly pushing students to seek cheaper digs. Should the economy weaken, students could continue trading down. Every developer is at risk of beds flooding the market, forcing them to cut rates. Also, competitors are building closer to campus, where students usually want to live.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Partly due to these concerns, the sector's stock-price growth has slowed. Last year, the stocks of both American Campus and <span class="companylink">Education Realty</span> gained more than 35%, more than double the apartment sector's returns. This year, <span class="companylink">Education Realty</span> has gained 1.7%, while American Campus has advanced 4.1%. Stocks in the apartment sector are up about 4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey Kolitch, portfolio manager of the Baron Real Estate Fund, which invests in both American Campus and <span class="companylink">Education Realty</span>, said he isn't worried about the stocks. "I wouldn't send the alarm signals on these companies," he said. "The stocks were rock stars last year. They're just taking a pause."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others aren't so sure. <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> analyst Anthony Paolone said he likes the sector's long-term potential, but there could be "more juice" with other companies, such as warehouse firm <span class="companylink">Prologis Inc</span>. and mall company <span class="companylink">Simon Property Group Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, cottage-housing deal activity is intensifying. In September, American Campus, the nation's largest student-housing operator by number of beds, paid $52 million for the 780-bed Retreat at San Marcos, a new 187-cottage community developed by Landmark and serving Texas State University in San Marcos. Landmark also is developing more than 660 beds near the University of Mississippi in Oxford with EdR and about 590 beds for Pennsylvania State University in State College, Pa., which EdR has an option to buy. The projects, in which rents could be as much as $695 and $865 a month, respectively, should open next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the University of Mississippi campus, single rooms on campus start at $5,600, or $622 a month, for the nine-month academic year, not including meals. At the Taylor Bend community a half-mile from campus, a three-bedroom, three-bath unit starts at $535 a person per month. Leases for off-campus housing typically are for 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers believe they will continue to attract students with amenities. At the Cottages of Columbia near the University of Missouri, the units include 9-foot ceilings, stainless-steel appliances, hardwood floors and marble bathroom countertops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My parents told me to not get used to living like this," said Avery Bond, a <span class="companylink">Louisiana State University</span> senior who has lived at the Cottages of Baton Rouge for three years.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Maura Webber Sadovi </div><div>784 words</div><div>24 October 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The financial storm in Europe is presenting opportunities for investors in U.S. properties as hard-pressed real-estate companies and lenders sell assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Wereldhave NV</span>, a Dutch real-estate company that has purchased office and residential properties in California, the Washington, D.C., area and Texas since 1978, has put its U.S. portfolio valued at roughly $800 million on the block to help pay down debt and shore up its operations in Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're retreating to core areas," John Lutzius, a managing director with Green Street Advisors, said of Wereldhave. "The company's invested in many markets . . . and that's led them into areas beyond their expertise."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of Wereldhave's first U.S. sales: a baseball-themed San Diego office building. The company is selling the 15-story DiamondView Tower overlooking the San Diego Padres' right field for $122 million to a venture of <span class="companylink">Cigna Corp</span>. The price is 24% lower than Wereldhave paid in 2008. The deal is expected to close this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal highlights why strapped European companies searching for quick cash are looking to sell assets in the recovering U.S. markets. They aren't selling assets in companies in countries such as Spain and Italy, where prices are in the doldrums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, values in the San Diego market have improved in the past year, although they aren't back to their 2008 levels. <span class="companylink">Cigna</span> and a private San Diego real-estate company cofounded by Philip Monroe and Dennis Cruzan are expected to realize a return of just over 6% annually, according to people with knowledge of the property. That shows a strengthening of the market because buyers in the area generally have been looking for returns in the 7.8% range over the past 12 months, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wereldhave is in a sales mode partly because its shares have been punished more by investors than other European real-estate companies. The FTSE EPRA/Nareit Global Real Estate Index of European companies has seen a roughly 20% increase this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it has been a tough year for Wereldhave, whose Dutch name translates to world assets. Its shares have fallen about 11% year to date and the company disappointed investors during the summer when it revalued its U.S. and U.K. portfolios.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The revaluation was needed partly because initial bids for the San Diego property, which was put on the block early in the year, came in lower than expected. Also, the performance of some recently acquired U.K. shopping centers was disappointing and the sovereign-debt crisis has hurt U.K. consumer spending outside of London. "The rest of the U.K. is really suffering," said Charles Bloema, Wereldhave's corporate treasurer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wereldhave also saw a management shake-up this year in which Chief Executive Hans Par stepped down and was succeeded by Dirk Anbeek. In August, the company hired broker Eastdil Secured to market the U.S. properties in one or several larger bundles rather than on a one-off basis like the San Diego property. The company said it would use part of the proceeds to reduce debt to a loan-to-value ratio of about 40%, from 47%. Wereldhave earlier had said it would use the money to acquire European properties and invest in redeveloping properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wereldhave executives now acknowledge the company paid too much for DiamondView. The deal closed in September 2008 during the market meltdown, and Wereldhave executives tried to compensate by demanding an $8 million price reduction, recalls Steven Black, president of Cisterra Development, which sold DiamondView. Cisterra dropped the price to $161.5 million. "We sold in the nick of time," Mr. Black said. "It's the best haircut I've ever received."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Built in 2007, DiamondView, overlooking Petco Park, is one of San Diego's newest and toniest office buildings. Office workers can watch games from balconies. A skybox that includes a bar and outdoor patios with 12-foot-long fire pits also can be rented for events. The building is about 96% occupied by such tenants as <span class="companylink">Cox Communications Inc</span>. <span class="companylink">CBRE Group Inc</span>. represented Wereldhave in the negotiations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Diego real-estate experts say DiamondView's new owner still faces challenges. The third-quarter vacancy rate for the city's downtown office market was 21%, above the 10.8% rate of one of its strongest suburban markets to the north, according to real-estate services firm Cushman &amp; Wakefield.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Fiona Law  </div><div>725 words</div><div>23 October 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Europe Edition)</div><div>WSJE</div><div>19</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A flood of cash into Asian investments has pushed stocks, currencies and real estate markets sharply higher, leaving governments struggling to stem the inflows for fear they will fuel inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inflow is a result of aggressive stimulus measures by central banks including the U.S. Federal Reserve, which in September announced its latest round of bond buying to help keep U.S. yields low in hopes of sparking growth. Low rates have in turn sent money managers scrambling to all corners of Asia seeking better investment returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indonesia, for one, had a net inflow of about $1.3 billion in bonds last month, compared with a net outflow of $540 million in August, according to Standard Chartered PLC. South Korea also witnessed net inflows of $1.4 billion in September, versus $2.4 billion in outflows the month before, the bank said in a recent report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Standard Chartered</span> said in the report that it expects investment inflows to Asia to accelerate "if Chinas economic data continues to stabilize and the Chinese yuan establishes a strengthening trend."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the region's smallest equity markets have been big beneficiaries, with Thailand's share index up 28% this year, the Philippines 24% higher and a main Indian index rallying 23%. Hong Kong reached a 14-month high on Monday. Only mainland China is lower this year as concerns linger over the health over its giant economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hong Kong and Singapore, two of the most-developed economies in the region, have also received overseas cash that has pumped up not just their currencies and stocks but also their housing markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in Hong Kong have surged to records, after doubling over the past four years, leading Financial Secretary John Tsang to warn Sunday that the real estate market has "seriously disconnected" with the slowing economy, and he threatened to impose measures to curb property prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Thailand, the central bank set new rules on Monday to encourage capital outflows and to balance the heavy influx of money. It did so by loosening restrictions for listed firms and individuals to invest in overseas equities and foreign-currency-denominated domestic bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Singapore's policy makers are also concerned about high property prices as private-home prices jumped 56% last quarter. Both Hong Kong and Singapore have stepped up efforts in the past few weeks to tighten rules on home loans to try to cool off the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Given the relatively small and open economies, Singapore and Hong Kong are more exposed to loose monetary policy in the U.S.," said Andrew Colquhoun, Fitch Ratings' head of Asian-Pacific sovereign ratings. "That could possibly increase their risks of more volatile asset prices and inflationary pressure."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In currency markets, the Singapore dollar has jumped almost 6% this year against the U.S. dollar, making it Asia's strongest performer. And in Hong Kong, the de facto central bank stepped into the currency markets on Friday to weaken the tightly controlled Hong Kong dollar for the first time in almost three years after it had climbed to the top of its trading band.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other countries in Southeast Asia are also feeling the wave of liquidity in the global economy. The flows are also seen in foreign direct investment, with Indonesia recording a 22% increase in FDI to a record high of 56.6 trillion rupiah ($5.9 billion) last quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the region's bond market has recorded unprecedented issuance of as much as $158 billion this year, up from $112.7 billion in all of last year, according to data provider Dealogic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists worry that all the money sloshing around will start to push up consumer prices in the region, and that will lead to interest-rate increases and start to choke off economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Inflation is going to snap back next year," said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economic research at <span class="companylink">HSBC Holdings PLC</span>. "As the region's economy [picks up its growth momentum], with the global liquidity, increased wages and prices, inflation will be the No. 1 risk in the region."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and Malaysia are more prone to inflation, while China, with restricted capital inflows, will be less impacted in terms of prices, Mr. Neumann said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jeannette Neumann </div><div>810 words</div><div>22 October 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oliver Chang is one Wall Street analyst who took his own advice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the head of U.S. housing strategy at <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>, Mr. Chang wrote a six-page research report in July 2011 about how the fallout from the real-estate crash was spurring demand for home rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report, "A Rentership Society," achieved must-read status among investors in the growing strategy of snapping up foreclosed homes and then renting them. As foreclosures exploded after the financial crisis, investors started to amass more and more houses. His report took the strategy to a broader audience of institutional investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That was something many investors hadn't thought about before he brought it to the market," said Ron Mass, former head of structured products at Western Asset Management, which oversees around $447 billion. He is looking at single-family real estate opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, Mr. Chang left his job on Wall Street. In August, he opened Sylvan Road Capital LLC to buy, renovate and rent previously foreclosed homes. He has a partnership with Delmar Realty Advisors, Atlanta, which has been in the buy-to-rent business since 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sylvan is spending the first $20 million of a commitment from private-equity giant <span class="companylink">Carlyle Group LP</span>, with the potential for additional funds that could take the amount to $300 million with debt-financing, people familiar with the matter said. Sylvan plans to spend more than $1 billion buying homes over the next two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sylvan owns about 200 homes and spends an average of $30,000 to $50,000 to renovate them, Mr. Chang said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is not about going long home prices or the housing recovery," Mr. Chang said. "We are taking an existing market . . . and taking a portion of that and making that institutionally owned and managed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The influence of Mr. Chang's reports and the investment from a major private-equity firm have given his firm added buzz in the suddenly crowded field of real-estate investors with high hopes for the rental income the properties will produce -- and the returns the eventual sale of the homes could bring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rich Ford, a managing director in <span class="companylink">Jefferies Group Inc</span>.'s real-estate investment banking group, estimated that institutional investors have raised about $8 billion primarily in equity to buy homes to rent within the past year. At $100,000 a home, that would buy 80,000 homes, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daniel Bathon Jr., CEO of VineBrook Partners LLC, a Lexington, Mass., investment firm that owns about 300 homes, said Mr. Chang's launch means other funds "sitting on the fence are now going to start thinking: 'I have to have a piece of this strategy somewhere in my portfolio.'" Mr. Chang also has skeptics who wonder if his prowess as an analyst will translate into returns for investors. "It's like an equity analyst reviewing <span class="companylink">General Electric</span>," said Thomas Silvia, Vinebrook's chief financial officer. "They can be a good analyst, but can they be the CEO of General Electric?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Chang responds that Sylvan has "a very complex business model that involves a significant amount of operating expertise, and that's exactly why I decided to work with the partners that I did."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts at John Burns Real Estate Consulting, Zelman &amp; Associates and <span class="companylink">Amherst Securities Group</span> were writing about the investment opportunity before or around the same time as Mr. Chang. Some major investors were considering the strategy before he sang its praises. <span class="companylink">Pacific Investment Management Co</span>., a unit of <span class="companylink">Allianz SE</span>, for instance, was considering buy-to-rent investments in early 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>, Mr. Chang spoke with many buy-to-rent investors. In late 2010, Mr. Chang spoke with James McClelland, president and CEO of Mack Cos., about the firm's property management and data. Mack has been buying and renting homes since 1998 and now owns and manages around 1,000 of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But not everyone finds the strategy so compelling. Scott Simon, Pimco's head of mortgage- and asset-backed securities teams, said the fund ultimately decided against major buy-to-rent investments. As more investors have piled in, home prices have increased in some markets, eating into profits. "We don't think it's a bad trade," Mr. Simon said. "But it's just not the panacea that everyone thinks."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Chang said he thinks the rental business will develop much like apartment rentals have in recent decades, with demand for both large and small managers. "There will always be a significant portion of the country that rents, and given the current economic environment in the country, that proportion is growing," Mr. Chang said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Ben Levisohn </div><div>711 words</div><div>20 October 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B9</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is in recovery mode, but one type of mortgage investment has gotten hammered lately. Experts say investors should wait awhile longer before wading back in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage real-estate investment trusts are companies that buy mortgage-backed securities and pay most of the returns to investors as dividends. The group plunged 5.9% in the five days through Oct. 15, the largest such drop since October 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The selloff might have some investors considering picking up the REITs on the cheap. In 2010 and 2011, similar drops have presented opportunities for people with the patience -- and nerves -- to jump back in. This time, however, investors should resist the urge, experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Past selloffs were driven mainly by fears about the sustainability of the financial system. The current plunge has more to do with concerns about the sustainability of the sector's dividends, spurred by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s decision to start buying mortgage-backed securities, and experts say the worries are unlikely to be assuaged soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's more room to go," says Andy Kapyrin, director of research at RegentAtlantic Capital in Morristown, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage REITs raise money through initial public offerings and load up on mortgage-backed securities. They then borrow more money and buy more bonds, until they are able to pay sizable dividends, often 10% or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has been successful in the past because mortgage REITs typically pay far less to borrow money than the yields they receive from the bonds they own. (The difference between the two is known as the spread.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage REITs dropped 8.1% during the five days ended Oct. 4, 2011, because the choppy financial markets made investors question whether the companies would be able to get the short-term financing they need to finance their positions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ability to make a profit off their borrow-short-term, lend-long-term strategy, however, was never called into question -- as long as the euro zone didn't fall to pieces. It didn't, and the REITs returned 40% during the following 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the focus is on the other side of the spread -- the yield mortgage REITs earn on their purchases. The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s low-rate policy has pushed the yields on all bonds lower, including those of mortgage-backed securities. Since January, the yield on the Barclays U.S. MBS Conventional 30 Year Index has dropped to 2.4%, from 2.9%. "The spread between yields and funding is abnormally low," says Sean Kelleher, president of Shay Asset Management in Miami, which oversees about $700 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultralow mortgage rates have many homeowners rushing to refinance their mortgages. On Oct. 3, the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span> said that refinance activity had hit its highest level since April 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's bad news for mortgage REITs. Every time one of their mortgages refinances they have to take the money and reinvest at lower interest rates, putting further pressure on the spread, says Jason Brady, portfolio manager of the $11.5 billion Thornburg Investment Income Builder Fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts are most worried about REITs that purchase pools of loans backed by government agencies like <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. That would include the likes of Annaly Capital Management, whose shares have dropped 6.7% during the past month, and American Agency Capital, which has dropped 9.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs that purchase private mortgage pools, including <span class="companylink">Invesco Mortgage Capital</span>, might hold up better because the securities they buy are less affected by Fed purchases because the central bank is only purchasing mortgage-backed securities issued by the U.S. agencies, says Thornburg's Mr. Brady.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like most investments, diversification could help reduce risk. One possibility: the iShares FTSE NAREIT Mortgage Plus Capped Index exchange-traded fund, which has a yield of 14.2%, after having dropped 4.3% over the past month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the chances of continued falling prices are considerable. "While the dividends can be quite attractive, mortgage REITs can be volatile," says Jay Wong, manager of the $175 million Payden Value Leaders Fund. He adds: "They're not something we usually invest in."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Robbie Whelan   </div><div>1096 words</div><div>19 October 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent months, Manhattan real-estate agent John Burger won the listing for the Upper East Side apartment of former <span class="companylink">CBS</span> anchor Mike Wallace and an Upper West Side penthouse once owned by Calvin Klein. He also met with representatives of a European country -- he declined to say which one -- about an ambassador's residence and had dinner with a client he sees occasionally while summering in the Hamptons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Burger has risen to the top by cultivating relationships with high net-worth individuals: "When I see clients in New York, I entertain them at my club," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such is life of New York City's top broker, as measured by portfolio value. Mr. Burger, 51 years old and a managing director with Brown Harris Stevens, had 27 listings valued at $440.8 million in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there's Rhonda Duffy, whose daily grind in Atlanta couldn't be further from Mr. Burger's rarefied world. For her, it's all about volume. In August, Ms. Duffy, 46 years old, had 724 listings worth $190 million, making her the top real-estate agent in her metro area. Ms. Duffy says she got to the top by being an early adopter of online marketing and by treating everyone -- high-end and low-end -- like a prized client: "There's no reason to treat anyone differently based on a price range," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How do top brokers become top brokers? A data analysis prepared for The Wall Street Journal by Realtor.com offers some clues. The company tallied up listings in 145 metropolitan areas and found, not surprisingly, that the richest portfolios are located in mansion-mad cities: New York, Miami, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Orange County, Calif. But in midsize cities that were dinged by the housing downturn and don't have the same hotblooded luxury markets, agents who want to get to the top need to develop different strategies to succeed. That can mean amassing a huge volume of listings, finding a new client base to tap -- or in some cases, lowering commissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is a definite set of agents who can control or have an impact on the market," says Curt Beardsley, a vice president for Realtor.com. "They've hit on something. They've figured out some way to get people to want to come and list property with them for sale."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Duffy's strategy is unlike that of most listing agents. Most brokers in the area take a commission of 3% to 3.5% on every sale at closing. Ms. Duffy, a broker for 14 years, relies instead on a high volume of business and a low-cost model. She doesn't attend every showing of the house, preferring instead to aggressively market each property online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither does she take a large commission once a home sells. Instead, she accepts up front $500 in marketing fees for each house she lists and then takes one-third of 1% of the sale price at closing, her policy since opening her own shop in 2002. (By comparison, Mr. Burger sticks exclusively to the top tier in Manhattan and charges commissions of 5% on the sale price for most properties, which is fairly typical for Manhattan).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The public has bought into the idea that selling a home is a really difficult transaction," she says. "The truth is, it's not a hard business, and we've proven it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The brokerage business is also more diffuse in Atlanta: There are 16,429 agents in the metro area with much smaller portfolios than those in New York, which has 8,615 agents. Atlanta was particularly hard hit by the housing crisis, as builders erected thousands of homes for which there was little or no demand, which contributed to the failure of hundreds of regional banks in Georgia. Some agents have made their mark by specializing in selling foreclosed homes for banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agents trying to break into the upper echelons of the industry continue to face challenges, mainly because inventory remains low. According to real-estate listings service Zillow, the number of homes for sale fell 20% nationally between August 2011 and August 2012. Falling home prices have also cut into agents' portfolios. In Santa Barbara, Calif., for example, the median home price has fallen to $695,300 from $934,000 five years ago, according to Zillow, a reflection of the fact that far fewer high-end homes are selling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response, Rebecca Riskin, the Santa Barbara metro area's top listings agent, took a different tack than Ms. Duffy in Atlanta. Rather than going for volume, she thinks of Santa Barbara as a small town full of wealthy potential sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She says that she has built up her $291.8 million portfolio, the third-biggest metro-agent portfolio in the country, by maintaining close relations with the town's well-to-do community, which is relatively small, and by trying to attract wealthy buyers looking for living space for their families from elsewhere in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A former professional ballet dancer in Salt Lake City, New York and Los Angeles, Ms. Riskin came to Santa Barbara in the early 1990s after a 10-year stint selling homes in Los Angeles. Her first year in Santa Barbara, she said, she earned $27,000 on one referral fee but slowly built her book of contacts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now 56, she focuses exclusively on high-end homes. She recently closed on the sale of a $19.5 million home designed in the 1920s by architect Reginald Johnson to a Los Angeles hedge-fund investor. Ms. Riskin says that in Santa Barbara and nearby affluent areas like Montecito, the brokerage business is genteel and not very competitive: Sellers often give listings to multiple agents in order to avoid offending anyone. According to Realtor.com there are only 808 agents in the Santa Barbara market, making it one of the most parochial markets in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Living here is less life in the fast lane. It's too small of a town to do a lot of backbiting," she says. "If you go to the market in Montecito and sneeze in the checkout aisle, by the time you get home, everyone in town knows you've got a cold."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Lauren Schuker Blum   </div><div>744 words</div><div>19 October 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hedge-fund manager John Paulson famously made nearly $4 billion in 2007 correctly betting that the housing bubble, fueled by the subprime mortgage market, would pop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then the billionaire investor somewhat reversed course, arguing that the housing cycle had hit a low point. "If you don't own a home, buy one," he said in a 2010 speech at the University Club in New York. "If you own one home, buy another one, and if you own two homes, buy a third and lend your relatives the money to buy a home." So far, that bet has been a loser: The Wall Street tycoon lost about $3 billion personally in 2011, according to people close to the hedge-fund manager, speculating that the economy would recover faster than it did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But through the downturn Mr. Paulson -- whose net worth is estimated to be around $11 billion, according to people familiar with his situation -- continued his real estate spending spree. Over the last eight years, he has spent more than $145 million on six properties, including two estates in Southampton, N.Y., two properties near Aspen, Colo., and two residences in Manhattan, where he is based, according to public records. (He later sold one of the Southampton properties, for $10 million in 2009, a year after buying a larger estate nearby).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, Mr. Paulson snapped up a 90-acre Aspen ranch and an adjoining property from Prince Bandar bin Sultan for a total of $49 million, according to public records, one of the highest prices ever paid for property in the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Aspen ranch was purchased at something of a discount: It was originally listed for $135 million in 2006, making it at that time the most expensive home for sale in the U.S. In both Aspen and Southampton, Mr. Paulson first bought a less expensive home before buying a larger estate nearby in the $40 million range a few years later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Paulson, 56, studiously avoids the media, rarely granting interviews. (He declined to comment for this article.) He grew up in a middle-class family in Queens, N.Y., and went to Harvard Business School, eventually starting <span class="companylink">Paulson &amp; Co</span>. with $2 million he raised partially from family and friends, as well as some of his own money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He personally occupies a residence each in Manhattan, Southampton and Aspen. He's not just investing in personal real estate, however, but also betting that the housing market will recover as development has slowed and supply diminishes. On Monday, funds managed by <span class="companylink">Paulson &amp; Co</span>. bought $30 million worth of stock in <span class="companylink">William Lyon Homes</span>, a Newport, Calif.-based builder. <span class="companylink">Paulson &amp; Co</span>. now owns about 25,000 home sites in Florida, Arizona, Nevada, Colorado and California -- all acquired through distressed sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last summer, Mr. Paulson's office released a statement around the time of his purchase of Hala Ranch saying that he has both directly and through his funds "substantial real-estate interests across the United States, including other properties in Colorado, Arizona, California, Nevada and Florida and Hawaii." Although he has rarely spoken about his holdings, the statement also said that "Mr. Paulson continues to be interested in real-estate opportunities across the U.S."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers across the country familiar with Mr. Paulson's personal homes say that the purchases -- some of which, like Hala Ranch, are among the biggest trophy properties in the U.S. -- have mostly retained their value through the real-estate downturn. Maureen Stapleton, an Aspen broker, says that Mr. Paulson paid a "fair price." "What he bought is very unique," she says. "It's a tremendous piece of property and the size of the home you just can't duplicate here in Aspen -- so I certainly think it will hold its value over the long term."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for what price Mr. Paulson would get if he flipped Hala Ranch next year, Joshua Saslove, the real-estate broker who sold Mr. Paulson the ranch, is mum. "These kinds of trophy properties are like apples -- they're not for buying or selling. They're meant for eating."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Pui-Wing Tam and Nancy Keates </div><div>2130 words</div><div>19 October 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The walls are tumbling down in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fueled by a tide of wealth from techies at <span class="companylink">Google</span>, LinkedIn and others, Silicon Valley denizens are tearing down older properties and constructing new multimillion-dollar homes. But instead of copying the Craftsman, Mediterranean or other traditional styles that were the rage among the digerati last decade, many are trying something different: modern-contemporary architecture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among them: Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg is building a more-than-9,200-square-foot glass-and-wood contemporary mansion in Menlo Park, Calif., after tearing down a 2,900-square-foot house on the half-acre lot she and husband Dave Goldberg purchased for $2.9 million in 2009. <span class="companylink">Google</span> executives including Steve Lawrence, creator of <span class="companylink">Google</span> Desktop, and Jim Miller, vice president of world-wide operations, have torn down and constructed modern homes. (Mr. Lawrence's house in Palo Alto, Calif., scheduled to be completed next year, has other contemporary touches, including a sports court with 18 1/2-foot ceilings in the basement, plus a slide that goes from one floor to another.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Danis Dayanov, who was an early employee at LinkedIn and is now chief executive of start-up Talkatone, plans to break ground next spring on a five-bedroom, 5,000-square-foot modern-style home in Los Altos Hills, Calif., which cost over $2.1 million for the land and the tear-down. And venture capitalist Jeff Clavier of SoftTech VC earlier this year moved into a minimalist wood-and-glass home in Palo Alto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house doesn't exactly fit the neighborhood, Mr. Clavier acknowledges. But "there will be a ton of tear-downs over the next few years," he says. "We'll see architecture evolve."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The modern homes stand out in a region where building tastes have stayed decidedly old-fashioned. Despite being ahead of the curve in technology, many tech titans opted for traditional architecture: The late Steve Jobs lived in an English-country-style home in Palo Alto, while Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt and <span class="companylink">Hewlett-Packard Inc</span>. CEO Meg Whitman own traditional-style homes in the posh enclave of Atherton. When Russian tech investor Yuri Milner paid $100 million for a Los Altos Hills home last year, he bought a 25,500-square-foot home modeled after a French chateau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere in Silicon Valley, which was mostly developed for midlevel engineers, "if you drive around, it is ranch house after ranch house after ranch house," says Bob Swatt, a high-end modern architect based in Emeryville, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Modern-style homes have been out of favor in Silicon Valley for about half a century, architects and builders say. In the 1950s and 1960s, modern homes went up in towns like Palo Alto and Menlo Park, developed by Joseph Eichler. The midcentury moderns, called "Eichlers," have interiors with high ceilings, simple lines and wide expanses of glass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But between then and now, modern-style homes were few and far between. James Witt, a Palo Alto developer who has constructed around 60 high-end houses over the past three decades, created a modern-style angular home in 1985 -- but it sat unsold for weeks, even though his traditional-style properties were typically snapped up before they were completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Modern "wasn't accepted," recalls Mr. Witt, who was so bruised by the experience that he didn't attempt another contemporary-style home until 2010. "Nobody was doing it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other attempts to go modern were beaten back by preservationists. <span class="companylink">Apple</span> co-founder Mr. Jobs's plans to tear down a historic Spanish Colonial Revival home in Woodside and rebuild a modern house were snarled for years after preservationists objected to any wrecking ball. The historic home was eventually demolished, but no new building plans are on file with the city, says Woodside Town Manager Kevin Bryant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, however, a confluence of demographics, aging housing stock and -- of course -- new technology is driving a shift. Many Silicon Valley homes built after World War II are nearing the end of their natural lives. The homes were "not well-built or insulated and they don't meet the space and quality demands of today," says architect Mr. Swatt. That is spurring many homeowners to tear down instead of remodel, clearing the way for new architecture styles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, a younger generation of techies is flooding Silicon Valley. Often in their 20s and 30s, the group is embracing a spare, clean look influenced by the home page of <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s search engine and the minimalist aesthetic of <span class="companylink">Apple</span> gadgets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm a fan of straight lines -- it's as simple as that," says Sanjukta Mathur, a 27-year-old Google software engineer who with her husband purchased a 3,200-square-foot contemporary-style home in Palo Alto for $2.8 million last year. Her husband, Gaurav Mathur, a 30-year-old who founded a start-up now owned by <span class="companylink">Google</span>, adds: "We grew up in the modern age and like contemporary."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond techies, other Silicon Valley professionals are also turning to contemporary-style residences. Steve Simpson, a local architect who designs both traditional and modern homes, says his business has flipped over the last five years to become dominated by clients -- including finance executives and doctors -- asking for modern styles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Before, 70% wanted traditional styles and 30% asked about modern, but now it's 60% who want modern and 40% traditional," Mr. Simpson says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It isn't only residential properties that are going modern. <span class="companylink">Apple</span> is building a new corporate campus in Cupertino which has been dubbed iSpaceship by some for its futuristic design. When Mr. Jobs unveiled the plans for the campus last year before his death, he boasted there would not be "a single straight piece of glass in the building" and that architecture students would come to see the spectacle. This August, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> announced it is working with modernist architect Frank Gehry on a new section of its headquarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend of Silicon Valley tear-downs leading to modern homes has gathered steam since 2010. In Atherton, which has only about 2,500 homes, city data show that demolition permits rose to 56 last year from 29 in 2009. Thirty new residences were completed last year, up from 11 in 2009. Officials in towns such as Woodside, Palo Alto and Los Altos say they see similar trends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, home prices have soared. In Palo Alto, the median price of a single-family home jumped to $1.7 million in August, up 34% from two years earlier, according to <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>. Even <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>'s disappointing initial public offering hasn't dampened the fervor: While Palo Alto's median home price declined slightly following the social network's May IPO, home prices are now climbing again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Homes are getting 15 offers each just to be torn down, with many bids $400,000 over asking," says Ken DeLeon, a Palo Alto broker. In terms of styles, he adds, "Mediterranean homes are now very out, and contemporary overall is in."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nicole Vidalakis, a 42-year-old psychologist, is building a 7,000-square-foot, $15 million modern house with a 75-foot-long infinity swimming pool in Portola Valley that is 73% glass and is set to be finished next year. Her goal was a house that reflected her love of modern architecture, something that "looks like a piece of art that someone happens to live in." But at the same time, she wanted to be in a rural setting. She says the experience overall has been great, but that early on, some neighbors complained about the home's size and a fence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They'd say, 'Why can't they live in the old house?'" says Ms. Vidalakis, who is the daughter of a shopping mall developer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other homeowners have had less-thorny reactions to their tear-downs and rebuilds. Jeff Aalfs, 43, didn't specifically ask for modern in the remodel and addition to his Portola Valley cottage. But when his architect, Field Architecture, showed him a very contemporary plan that would add 1,500 square feet by cascading the house down a hill, ending at the bottom with a family room with 17-foot ceilings, he loved the way it looked. After it was finished, he was appointed to the Architectural &amp; Site Control Commission, in Portola Valley, where he says about half the new homes in the town are modern-contemporary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Aalfs adds that when people have trouble with a project, it is almost always because of the size and placement of a house on a lot, and not about the style and design. Modern homes tend to draw more complaints because they have so much glass that people worry about what they call "light pollution" -- neighbors being affected by all the light coming from the homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Doty, 56, a Stanford University neurosurgeon and occasional entrepreneur, moved into a $5 million-plus four-bedroom modern home three months ago in Los Altos Hills after knocking down a ranch-style home on the lot. While the new home -- with a metal roof and an exterior of Venetian plaster stucco, glass and stone -- took 18 months to build, the neighbors were "supportive," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With so many neighbors in their 70s, "this area is just about to start undergoing a transition to new homes," he adds. Down the street, another modern home is under construction, says Mr. Doty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are so many new modern homes in the area that some people worry about being accused of imitating their neighbors. Diana Desbard, a 50-year-old designer who works on commercial building projects for tech companies including <span class="companylink">Google</span> and <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, and her husband, Michel Desbard, a venture capitalist, are building a 2,800-square-foot modern home in downtown Palo Alto that's adjacent to a modern home designed by the same firm, Joseph Bellomo Architects. Though both homes will have a tubular steel frame and a flat roof, she was careful to make sure there were enough differences from the house next door -- she opted for thermal-plastic siding and a beige concrete exterior, while her neighbor's exterior is wood -- so "it wouldn't be a copycat," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Genni Lawrence, the wife of <span class="companylink">Google</span> executive Steve Lawrence, says their new modern home could have been a cause of concern for neighbors because the couple tore down the existing ranch-style home and dug a 20-foot hole in the ground to accommodate the basement sports court. But after fielding questions about what the hole would turn into, most neighbors appeared satisfied, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It helps that the house, which Ms. Lawrence says cost $2 million to buy and tear down and $5 million to rebuild, isn't a severe modern boxlike home. Instead, the Lawrences are using cedar siding and stucco in a muted beige color for the exterior. From the street, the home looks like a one-story structure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Lawrence says she and her family are looking forward to moving into the 7,000-square-foot four-bedroom, 5 1/2-bathroom house next year after it's done, particularly after living in a Mediterranean-style home for the past eight years. That home has a formal living and dining room that the family doesn't use, and none of the wide open spaces and big windows that will come with the new home, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It didn't match our lifestyle," she says. "We like things very simple and clean and not fussy."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential construction picked up momentum in September and now is running at its highest level in four years, a turn that could have a positive effect on the jobs market and the broader U.S. economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders started work on new houses and apartments at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 872,000 units last month, the Commerce Department said Wednesday, up 15% from August and 34.8% from September a year ago, far exceeding economists' expectations. The level of starts was the highest since July 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists contend that the rise in construction, if sustained, could boost job creation and economic growth. The <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>, a trade group, estimates that each home built generates three full-time jobs and $90,000 in new tax revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The path between here and when we get to a sustainable pace of home building, should add, cumulatively, up to two percentage points" to the nation's gross domestic product, said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co</span>. "It could take three or four years, but at the pace we're going at now, we might get there sooner rather than later."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government report showed new building was up in three of four U.S. regions. Building rose 20.1% in the West, 19.9% in the South and 6.7% in the Midwest. New construction fell 5.1% in the Northeast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists say a continued rise in construction could further drive down the unemployment rate, which fell to 7.8% in September from 8.1% in August. Between 2007 and 2011, more than 2.1 million construction workers lost their jobs, according to the <span class="companylink">Bureau of Labor Statistics</span>, and since then, only 273,000 have been hired back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent growth in residential building "gives some hope in the coming months for more construction jobs," said Anika Khan, a senior economist with <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>. "A lot of construction workers are the ones who have been discouraged and underemployed, on the sidelines. If these particular workers find work, it will have a big overall economic impact, because it will boost wage and salary growth and income growth."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September, the number of new building permits, an indication of future construction, rose 11.6% to an annualized level of 894,000, also the highest level since July 2008. Starts on single-family homes, which made up 69% of housing starts last month, rose 11% in September to a rate of 603,000 units, a 43% improvement from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pop in home building also suggests a divide between consumers and industry in the economic recovery. While businesses continue to hold back on big investments because of uncertainty surrounding the coming elections and changes to the tax code, consumers' attitudes are brightening, pushing up spending on goods such as new homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Consumption indicators seem to be pretty strong, while investment indicators seem to be pretty weak," said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist for Capital Economics. "The fiscal cliff and what's happening in Europe should be driving consumption and industrial numbers in the same direction. But in this case, consumers don't seem to be as aware as businesses are."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Craig Perry, president of Centerline Homes, a Coral Springs, Fla., builder, said in the past six months he has started construction at three developments in Orlando and Broward County in South Florida, and nearly all 136 homes in the communities are under contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're seeing a much better attitude among buyers," Mr. Perry said. "People feel like home prices are rising, and mortgage rates are very low. So before prices rise too high, people want to get in on it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another reason for the jump in new-home construction is that inventories of previously owned homes and foreclosed homes have declined, spurring some buyers to begin looking at new properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> reported last month that at the current pace of sales, it would take 6.1 months to sell the listed supply of homes, down from 8.2 months of supply a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This month, <span class="companylink">CoreLogic Inc</span>., a real-estate data company, said the "shadow inventory," or the pending supply of homes that are delinquent or in foreclosure and could ultimately be listed for sale, fell to 2.3 million units in July, or a supply of 6.0 months, down 10.2% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ilin Misaras, who coordinates international programs for students at <span class="companylink">North Carolina State University</span>, and her husband recently paid $500 to a builder in Raleigh, N.C., to reserve a piece ofland for a four-bedroom house to be built next year. The couple plans to pay about $245,000 for the home and aims to move in next August. Ms. Misaras, who is 30 years old, said she and her husband are watching their spending. They canceled a trip to England, France and Italy to put the money toward their new home-- but they aren't worried about the economy. "We are looking at the economy, especially in our area, the Triangle, as skyrocketing right now," Ms. Misaras said. Once she gets a pending pay raise and her husband finishes his studies to become a registered nurse, she expects their household income will go up. "The stars are just kind of aligned for us right now," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While this year's housing starts are up from a low of 478,000 in April 2009, they are still below the historical average. Builders have started construction on about 1.5 million new homes a year since 1959, to keep up with household formation which has run at an average of 1.27 million new homes a year, according to census data analyzed by <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. households, many of which doubled up during the economic downturn in order to save money, have been growing by just over one million a year since 2008. "My gut tells me it's the demographics kicking in," said Patrick Newport, an economist with IHS Global Insight. "At some point, builders are going to have to ramp up at a very steep rate. That's what's kicking in here. Construction has just been depressed for too long."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Candace Jackson   </div><div>1691 words</div><div>19 October 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Asia</div><div>AWSJ</div><div>W12</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2012 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2009, a historic townhouse on Manhattan's Upper East Side hit the market for $28 million but didn't sell. The listing recently got a price adjustment -- to $35 million. In Miami Beach, Fla., a home once owned by Jennifer Lopez went on the market for $29 million in 2010, but the owner didn't get an offer he liked. So he took it off the market for a year, then relisted it. The current asking price: $40 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid signs of a rebound in the luxury-housing market, some sellers are trying a bold, if risky, tactic: raising their prices. According to online housing tracker <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span>, 436 listings priced over $1 million in the New York metro area on the market as of late August had raised their prices over the prior 12 months, compared with 266 for the same period two years prior. In the Miami-Fort Lauderdale metro area, 5% of listings priced above a million dollars had an increase in the recent period, compared with 2.3% two years prior.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In cities like New York, London and Miami, record-breaking purchases by ultrawealthy overseas buyers have boosted confidence at the very top end of the market. Earlier this year, a Manhattan real-estate record was broken when a trust linked to a Russian billionaire's daughter paid $88 million for a penthouse owned by former <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> chief Sanford I. Weill. This summer, a house on Indian Creek, a private island off Miami Beach, sold for $47 million, also to a Russian buyer, setting a record for Miami/Dade County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result can be an irresistible temptation to try to keep up with the biggest sellers in the neighborhood. Leroy Schecter, chairman of Marino/Ware Industries, has a house down the street from the home that sold for $47 million, and next door to one that sold for $40 million. He recently put his 21,746-square-foot house back on the market for $45 million, up from $35 million when he first listed it in 2007. Mr. Schecter, 85, says he took it off the market for a few years for personal reasons, but the blockbuster sales nearby partly motivated him to relist at a higher price. Mr. Schecter says he plans to donate proceeds from the sale to his charitable foundation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pricing homes at the extreme high end of the market is a somewhat subjective, and often irrational, process. Because there are so few similar properties for sale, and the homes are often unique, it's difficult to set a standard for a pricing scale, brokers say. For a home priced above $30 million, a "reasonable" price may be in the eye of the beholder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Gainor, a health-care entrepreneur who now runs a financial-services company, bought his Miami Beach home from Jennifer Lopez for $13.9 million in 2005, then spent four years gut-renovating it, including replacing the roof and adding reclaimed wood floors. The 12,152-square-foot home, on 1.2 acres with 200 feet of waterfront overlooking the Miami skyline, has seven bedrooms, a master suite with an office and gym and a closet made from three bedrooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 2010 his children had left for college, so Mr. Gainor and his wife decided to put the home on the market for $29 million. Despite getting little more than a few "lowball" offers, he says, he was convinced the house was worth more, and in 2011 he raised the price to $34 million. He then took the house off the market for a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gainor says he recently decided to relist the home for $40 million, citing the recent sales in the same price range and an improved market. Though he predicts he may get some offers closer to what he was initially asking, he's not planning to sell the home for much below its current list price. "The house has so much value in it from a construction standpoint," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His broker, Nelson Gonzalez, thinks the market can support this type of increase. Mr. Gonzalez, a Miami Beach-based broker with <span class="companylink">Esslinger-Wooten-Maxwell Realtors</span>, says trophy homes have been selling so briskly there's very little left in the range of $20 million to $50 million. "If we didn't raise the price, the seller would definitely be leaving money on the table," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some real-estate veterans say raising the asking price rarely results in a higher final selling price, however. High-end listings often take awhile to sell, even in a good market. Sales remain slower in many areas, and are often preceded by price cuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm extremely skeptical," says Jonathan Miller, of appraisal and research firm Miller Samuel. Brokers say raising the price could scare away buyers who were on the fence when the home was asking less. "Unless it's a unique property, it signals to the market the seller is not serious," says Donna Olshan, a New York-based broker who publishes a weekly report on luxury Manhattan properties. She adds that homes that have had their prices raised tend to follow the same pattern as overpriced listings -- they either sit on the market or get a big price cut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In the end, sanity usually wins the day and the price comes back down to reality," Ms. Olshan says. "You can't trick the market." The median home in the U.S. sells for about 2% less than its asking price, according to data from <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strategy sometimes works. Julia Hoagland, a broker with Brown Harris Stevens in New York, took on a listing that had previously been on the market for six months with another firm. The 26th-story Upper East Side condo with views of Central Park was originally asking $2.73 million. After researching comparable sales, Ms. Hoagland convinced the sellers to raise the asking price by $220,000, or 8%. "It is risky, to be perfectly honest," says Ms. Hoagland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After relisting the home with a price increase, slightly restaging the apartment and coming up with a new marketing strategy that included hiring a jazz pianist to play during a cocktail event, she says she got seven offers on the apartment in seven weeks. It ultimately sold for $2.875 million, or about $150,000 more than the original asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And some brokers say a splashy price can attract the attention of global trophy-property hunters. The record-setting home in Miami was originally shopped around for $52 million in 2010. Then, the price was raised to $60 million. "We got a lot of attention," says Oren Alexander, one of the listing brokers and the son of one of the developers. "When you list something for a record price like that, you create the hype." Though the home eventually sold for $47 million, Mr. Alexander credits the higher price tag with putting the home on the international map.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ravi Dhar, director of Yale's Center for Customer Insights and a professor of management, marketing and psychology, says consumers will generally use the original price of an object as their reference point. But for homes seen as unique, raising the price instead of lowering it can tap into consumer psychology. Buyers might "infer that because the price went up, there must be a lot of demand," he says. "There are various ways of signaling scarcity and uniqueness, and then slicing and dicing this, and real-estate agents are great at this."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some developers are trying price increases as well. In London's Hampstead neighborhood, four newly built homes are now asking significantly more than they were last summer. The largest is listed for $22.5 million, up $3.2 million. Paul Goldstein, a London-based real-estate developer, says he spent seven years on the project, and decided to raise prices when the construction dust cleared and he saw the finished product. One potential buyer was turned off when he heard he'd have to pony up $3.2 million more for the same house. "I'm very much of the opinion that you had your chance and we've moved on," says Mr. Goldstein.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others quietly add to their prices with little fanfare. The Laureate, a new condominium on Manhattan's Upper West Side, has seen several price increases since its units, which currently range in price from $1.7 million to $23 million, hit the market last year. A listing broker for the building declined to comment, saying the topic was not something the developers wanted to discuss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Simple upgrades can prompt brokers to raise prices in markets where high-end demand is strong. Leonard Steinberg, a New York-based real estate agent, says he recently took on a TriBeCa listing that had been on the market for over a year with another agent, and raised the price by $4.5 million to $49.5 million -- after repainting the home's brightly colored walls and removing some of the more "taste-specific" artwork, including a collection of shrunken heads. The three-story building, which includes five separate apartments, "seemed underpriced to me," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some price increases amount to rollbacks on previous discounts. In Los Angeles, 95-year-old actress Zsa Zsa Gabor's home originally came on the market in 2011 for $15 million, then was reduced to $12.9 million before it disappeared from the market; it is now listed for $14.9 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Erickson, the listing broker, says the increase partly reflects the fact that the home was used to shoot a Michael Douglas film, and production crews made $200,000 worth of upgrades. But "a lot of it was a publicity stunt, to be frank," he says. "It creates enough of a curiosity that people then want to look at the house and go, 'What happened?'"</p>

</div><div class="author">By Robbie Whelan and A.D. Pruitt </div><div>791 words</div><div>17 October 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C10</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors who bet on a housing recovery early in the year by jumping into home-builder stocks have racked up big gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as the builder rally slows, investors have found a new way to bet on housing: buying shares of brokers, Internet listing sites, mortgage traders and other firms on the service side of the housing industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, for example, investors pounced on the initial public offering of <span class="companylink">Realogy Holdings Corp</span>., a company that owns many of the nation's largest real-estate brokerage franchises, including <span class="companylink">Coldwell Banker</span>, Century 21 and <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International</span>. Investors snapped up 46 million shares of the company and drove the price up 27% from its initial offering price of $27. The company raised $1.2 billion in cash, making the deal the largest housing-related IPO since the downturn. In 4 p.m. trading on the <span class="companylink">New York Stock Exchange</span> Tuesday, <span class="companylink">Realogy</span> was at $35.74, up $2.24, or 6.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This deal just hit the right sweet spot at the right time," said one banker involved in the underwriting of the IPO. "Most people figure the housing market has bottomed, and this is the only way to play," since more traditional housing investments, like builder stocks and mortgage bonds, may be overvalued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even companies that technically aren't part of the real-estate sector, but are loosely related, are getting a pop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Zillow Inc</span>., a seven-year-old company that allows consumers to research home prices and generates revenue through advertising, went public last summer at an initial price of $20 a share. At 4 p.m. trading Tuesday on the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq Stock Market</span>, Zillow stood at $38.38, a gain of 92% since it went public. Shares of <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, a website that lists homes for sale and provides market research for home buyers, closed up 41% after its first day of trading in September. Although the stock has given back some of those gains, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> shares, at $22.58 in 4 p.m. trading on the <span class="companylink">New York Stock Exchange</span>, are still 33% higher than their IPO pricing of $17.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies like Zillow and <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> are poised to gain market share from print and display advertisers and traditional broker websites, said Bradley Safalow, an analyst who covers the companies for PAA Research. Both companies grew through the downturn, despite slow home sales, and spent much of the past few years branding themselves as go-to sources for real-estate information.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If real-estate agents are making more money, they can spend more money on marketing on websites like Zillow, which is good for them," Mr. Safalow said. "The housing recovery will only add to their growth."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Realogy</span>, by contrast, provides investors with a much more direct way of betting on the recovery. The company, which has 6,100 franchise and company-owned offices nationwide that acted as either buyer or seller agents in home sales more than 1.16 million times last year -- roughly one-quarter of the dollar-value volume of all home sales in the country involving a broker -- takes a 6% cut of all commissions earned by the real-estate agents who use its brands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Western Asset Mortgage Capital Corp</span>., a real-estate investment trust that mainly invests in bonds backed by residential mortgages that are guaranteed by federal agencies, has seen its share price rise about 5% since its initial public offering on May 9.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jason Arnold, an analyst at <span class="companylink">RBC Capital Markets</span>, said investors are partly drawn to Western Asset because the company has the ability to add bonds secured by riskier mortgages, including prime jumbos, alt-A and subprime loans, to its portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If home prices are indeed getting higher, the values of the homes underlying the mortgage-backed securities are going to go up in value, and in turn" raise bond prices, Mr. Arnold said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 4 p.m. trading on the <span class="companylink">New York Stock Exchange</span> Tuesday, Western Asset was up 27 cents, or 1.3%, to $21.32.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors are piling into these housing-related companies in part because the traditional housing plays have become overheated. Stocks of home builders, buoyed by positive economic indicators, have risen 145% since August 2011. "Sentiment has swung from one extreme to another in the last year," said Nishu Sood, a real-estate analyst at <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>. "It makes people sit up and wonder, does it make sense for them to be trading this high?"</p>

</div><div class="author">By Vincent Cignarella   </div><div>939 words</div><div>15 October 2012</div><div>16:36</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be effective in encouraging spending and boosting jobs, the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary efforts to drive up asset prices need to drill down to consumers by boosting their sense of wealth and disposable income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although equities--and to a lesser degree, housing prices--have posted some gains this year, partly because of the Fed's "quantitative easing," some red flags suggest these gains aren't much of a boon to households.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One sign of failure lies in the ballooning level of student debt, which one in five households now carry, according to a recent report by the Pew Research Center that was drawn from the Fed's own Survey of Consumer Finances. That ratio is double what it was in 1989.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher unemployment, rising college enrollment and lower incomes are behind this trend. But what's striking is that households earning at least $146,792, the highest income bracket in the survey, saw college debt increase by 24.4% to $44,810, a bigger gain than any of the income categories below them. That speaks volumes about how households aren't able to take advantage of a positive "wealth effect" right now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One would normally expect well-to-do households to turn to cheaper home equity loans to finance their kids' tuition. Student loans from Direct Parent Plus, a program sponsored by the Federal government, carry a 7.9% interest rate plus a 4% origination fee, whereas mortgages charge around 3.5% for 30 years with only minimal fees. It's even more wasteful when you consider that mortgage interest is fully deductible, whereas deductions on student loans are phased out for the wealthiest households.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why would such families take on expensive student loans rather than borrow against their homes? Because they have no choice. Even as house prices have shown signs of recovery, the fall in housing prices from 2007 to 2010 was so large that a huge swath of Middle America is still underwater on their homes. Most families will need a much larger recovery in their home equity value before they can "cash out" with a new mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, home ownership rates among those under 35 have fallen from 42.8% in 2006 to 36.5% in 2012, which erodes the base of homeowners for whom future gains would boost their wealth and potential spending power. And if the Fed has some success in raising prices, it might now be pricing a larger group of aspiring homeowners out of the market, ensuring that the economic impact remains narrow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clearly, some households have picked up equity. Indicators such as the Case-Shiller new home index are showing gains, and such gains may at least partly explain why consumer confidence data have turned up. But even those advances are suspect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are many skeptics among real estate observers who argue, for example, that the main reason prices have finally turned higher after five years of declines is that the government has cracked down on tens of thousands of poorly executed foreclosure deals. That has removed a huge inventory overhang, they say, allowing prices to rise as supply shrinks. But it's hardly a function of sustained demand for homes or a sign that prices are bound to keep rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Optimists still have the stock market to turn to, of course. The S&amp;P 500 is now up 106% from its bottom in March of 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But whereas a decade ago such an impressive rally would have lifted the shared wealth of American households, it no longer has such an effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that's because the stomach-churning losses of 2008 and early 2009 scared everyone away from the stock market. The percentage of American households that own stock is now at just 46%, down from 59% in 2001.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The grand plan behind the Fed's zero-interest rate policy and three bouts of quantitative easing bond-buying since 2008 is to keep interest rates low, push investors into riskier assets and thus eventually improve consumers' wellbeing enough that they spend money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if the asset gains aren't sustainable and if they don't affect a wide enough group of people, all that printed money could be going to waste.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Conor Dougherty and Dawn Wotapka </div><div>1017 words</div><div>15 October 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Millions of families lost their homes to foreclosure after the housing crash hit six years ago. Now, some of those families are back in the housing market. Call them the "boomerang" buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is difficult to quantify the exact number of boomerang buyers, but real-estate agents, mortgage brokers and home builders all say a significant number of new buyers are families and individuals who went through foreclosure as recently as three years ago, the time period that buyers who defaulted on a mortgage must typically wait before becoming eligible for a mortgage backed by the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent conference call with investors, Stuart Miller, chief executive of Miami-based home builder <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>., said the company was seeing more people "coming out of the penalty box." At <span class="companylink">Cornerstone Communities</span>, a San Diego home builder, roughly 20 of the 110 closings they have had this year came from buyers who have been through a foreclosure or short sale, estimates Ure Kretowicz, the company's chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's more than incremental business, that's for sure," adds Dan Klinger, president of K. Hovnanian American Mortgage, the mortgage arm of builder <span class="companylink">Hovnanian Enterprises Inc</span>. With growing interest from these formerly delinquent buyers, K. Hovnanian provides its sales staff with a flier with industry guidelines listing the mortgage-eligibility rules for all types of derogatory events, from foreclosure to bankruptcy filings. "The industry is saying, 'Pay your dues and then get back into the market,' " Mr. Klinger says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using the three-year benchmark it takes to get an FHA-guaranteed loan, in this year's second quarter there were 729,000 households that were foreclosed upon during the bust that are now eligible to apply for an FHA mortgage, up from 285,000 in the second quarter of 2011, according to an analysis of foreclosure data by <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics. The company projects that number will grow to 1.5 million by the first quarter of 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typical boomerang buyers are people like April Del Rosario, who purchased her first home in 2006 when she was 24 years old. Newly married and unsure of what terms such as adjustable-rate mortgage meant, Ms. Del Rosario and her husband paid $315,000 for a two-bedroom condominium in San Diego's Mission Valley area, a location they picked because it was central to their jobs. The $2,600 monthly mortgage payment was already a struggle, but when the mortgage rate was adjusted higher and Ms. Del Rosario became pregnant, the couple was overwhelmed. They lost the home to foreclosure in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We were really young and stupid," she says. "All of a sudden, our already really expensive mortgage was going to go up. I was pregnant and everything was just bad timing on our part."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three years later, the couple is back in the market. The Del Rosarios were recently approved for a loan for a $280,000 home in Chula Vista, south of San Diego, which, when it is completed in January, will have three bedrooms and a two-car garage. Instead of proximity to work, they picked the location based on its school district and their desire to live there a long time. And while they now must pay $300 a month in mortgage insurance, the family's income has grown, and their total mortgage payment is still a little lower than before, around $2,400. "We're trying to be really conservative. We just want to have a nice place for our son," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a web of rules for when and how people who have lost homes to foreclosure or short sales or have gone through a bankruptcy can become eligible for a new mortgage. It typically takes three years after a foreclosure or short sale for a buyer to qualify for an FHA-backed loan. In many cases, it takes just one year after a Chapter 13 bankruptcy discharge, according to the agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> or <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> require a wait period of as much as seven years after a foreclosure or short sale before a consumer can become eligible for a conventional mortgage, though some short sellers can purchase again after as little as two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Becoming eligible for a new mortgage doesn't mean that buyers will necessarily qualify for one. Lenders still require borrowers to have strong credit score and to have been paying their other bills on time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently, many of the people who had lost their home to foreclosure or short sale have rented homes, leaving many economists and industry watchers to wonder if the nation would become more of a renter society. In the second quarter, the national home-ownership rate came in at 65.5%, down from 65.9% a year earlier and 69.2% in the second quarter of 2004. Each percentage-point decline represents about one million households.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as rental rates continue rising -- they climbed 0.8% in the third quarter to a national average of $1,090 per month, according to <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>. -- homeownership is increasingly becoming cheaper than renting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is part of what enticed Ronda Martinez, 39, back in to the market. In 2007, she and her husband, Mark, let their two-story, $430,000 home in Perris, Calif., go into foreclosure when they were unable to sell it when required to move to Phoenix for a job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later, in 2010, she was laid off from her job at a real-estate-data company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, the family has repaired their finances, and Mrs. Martinez found a new job. This month, the family is closing on a $150,000 home in Phoenix that has five bedrooms and a pool in the back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Initially people are upset and think, 'I'll never buy again,'" she said. But "there's no reason to give up on owning."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Urban Meyer quit as head football coach of the University of Florida in 2010, he left behind more than his two championship trophies: He and his wife, Shelley, are still trying to sell this six-bedroom, 5½-bathroom, 6,800-square-foot home in Gainesville, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Listed for $1.7 million in February, the house comes with a covered swimming pool, a sand volleyball court out back, and what Mrs. Meyer calls a "ginormous" family room, built to accommodate a full house of extra-large players. Because Coach Meyer, now at Ohio State University in Columbus, had such ardent local fans, the house is in a gated community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At one point the online real-estate photos of the Meyers's house showed a room with a large turquoise-and-orange Gators rug. That's gone now, moved with the Urbans to the house they recently bought in Columbus, Ohio. "We can't put it out because it would make all the Buckeye fans mad," Mrs. Meyers says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houston Nutt, who was head coach at the University of Mississippi until last year, has two Oxford, Miss., homes on the market: One where he and his wife live (a five-bedroom, 6½-bathroom home on 30 acres with an in-ground pool and a waterfall), priced at $1.6 million; and, next door, a lodge-style house where his kids lived on nearly 136 acres with a barn for their nine horses that is for sale for $1.3 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both properties are on a 45-acre lake. Mr. Nutt found the lodge first – in 2008 -- and convinced the owner to sell it to him. When the house next door became available he bought that in 2009 and moved in there. 'It made it so that we didn't have any neighbors,' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hugh Freeze, who just became head coach at Ole Miss, just bought a new house in Oxford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Freeze is pictured here with his wife Jill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Freeze's new house isn't too far from the "dream house" he and his wife Jill built the first time they were in Oxford, when he was an assistant coach from 2005 to 2007, and which took them nine months to sell when they left.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ron Zook has a 6,000-square-foot house he is trying to sell in Champaign, Ill. now that he is no longer University of Illinois head coach. It has five bedrooms and five walk-in closets, an oversize wet bar and entertainment center with plush theater seating and is for sale for $799,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nick and Terry Saban are trying to sell a spec house they built in Lake Burton, Ga. They intended to use the lot for their family, but changed their minds after a different lot came available. Priced at $10.95 million, it is 10,000 square feet, with six bedrooms and nine baths.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house the Sabans are trying to sell has a massive grand room with a 24-foot vaulted ceiling. The wine cellar features antique gates from Barcelona; elsewhere there is a European-style pub, a billiards room, a home office, formal and professional kitchens, staff quarters and a four-car garage. There is also a boat house with a deck and a swimming dock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rich Rodriguez and his wife, Rita, now live in a 8,900-square-foot home in Tucson, Ariz., where he is head coach at the <span class="companylink">University of Arizona</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Rodriguez says she looks considers entertaining at the house part of her husband's job. That's why they need a lot of space and amenities. "You want to be able to feel you've done everything you can do to make the program successful," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When she picks a house, Mrs. Rodriguez tries to find amenities college football players would like, including a swimming pool, a theater room to watch games and a place to play video games and cards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One benefit of the warm weather in Arizona is that the ping pong table can be outside, says Mrs. Rodriguez, pictured here with her husband at their new home.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anton Troianovski </div><div>970 words</div><div>11 October 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies in technology and related fields are testing a way to avoid paying taxes: persuading the government that their real business is real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">American Tower Corp</span>., which operates cellphone towers, will save more than $400 million a year by 2017, analysts estimate, thanks to its new tax status as a real-estate investment company. <span class="companylink">Equinix Inc</span>, whose warehouses are full of computer servers, is expected to avoid taxes of around $150 million a year. <span class="companylink">Iron Mountain Inc</span>., which helps clients shred documents and store data, may save nearly as much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key: getting approval from the <span class="companylink">Internal Revenue Service</span> to convert from a corporation into a real-estate investment trust, a type of company that generally doesn't pay taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As both traditional landlords and an increasingly diverse array of other businesses have adopted the structure, the total market value of REITs jumped to $451 billion in 2011 from $9 billion in 1990, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors typically cheer when companies turn themselves into REITs. But some real-estate executives and analysts worry that the new wave of applicants -- including a pair of companies that run private prisons -- could spark a political backlash at a time when deficits and taxes are high on Washington's agenda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The real-estate companies correctly are nervous about this phenomenon," says Kenneth T. Rosen, a real-estate consultant. "The more it looks like a tax loophole, the more likely it is to affect them negatively."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That concern came to the fore last month after Jim Taiclet, American Tower's chief executive, touted the tax benefits of his company's conversion to a REIT on business channel CNBC. "You should feel that we're a growth company that's taking advantage of the real-estate trust structure," Mr. Taiclet said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The video clip went viral in some corners of the REIT world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American Tower says its primary business has always been real-estate-based. Mr. Taiclet's remarks on CNBC "merely pointed out that the company could continue its growth trajectory and operate as a REIT," a spokesman says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Equinix, which unveiled plans a month ago to convert to a REIT, weighed the risk of changes in the tax code, says CEO Steve Smith. "Our advisers have told us that even if they wanted to change the policy around REIT conversions, it would take years because of the bureaucracy," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Iron Mountain</span> declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs, which reported $25 billion in profits last year, were created by Congress in 1960. The idea was to let ordinary Americans buy shares in skyscrapers or shopping malls just as they could buy stock in a company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The basic rules are simple. REITs have to have most of their assets and income tied to real estate, and they must pay out at least 90% of their taxable income as dividends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The downside of that requirement is that money that could have funded new investments or acquisitions has to be distributed to investors. Still, companies are drawn to the fact REITs generally don't pay corporate tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Proponents of expanding the real-estate club argue that it makes sense for the definition of real estate to evolve as technologies change. The IRS for the most part has gone along, ruling in recent years that cellphone towers, billboards, data centers, and other facilities are "inherently permanent structures" that qualify for REIT treatment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics, however, say the expansion risks being at odds with the original intent of Congress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The further you allow corporations that engage in a broader range of activities into the REIT cubbyhole, the further the erosion to the tax base," says Steven Rosenthal, a tax lawyer and visiting fellow at the <span class="companylink">Tax Policy Center</span> who helped draft REIT legislation in the 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A growing number of companies are testing the definition of real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data-center operator Equinix rents space to companies that need to house roomfuls of computer servers. It also provides services like power and telecom hookups. Existing data-center REITs typically consider that rental income tax free, but Equinix is also trying to shelter the sums it makes charging clients to connect with the computer systems it houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lamar Advertising Co</span>. says its billboards and roadside signs touting food options at the next highway exit could count as rental property. Lamar, whose shares jumped as much as 14% on Aug. 8 after it said it might seek REIT status, didn't reply to requests for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Iron Mountain</span> says most of its income comes from the document-storage business, which has similarities to consumer self-storage businesses already established as REITs. But the company has warned investors that IRS approval of its REIT conversion isn't assured. It estimates it will spend as much as $425 million on the conversion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The debate over what businesses can get REIT treatment is likely to heat up. Mark D. Kirshenbaum, a tax lawyer at <span class="companylink">Goodwin Procter</span> in Boston, says bankers and potential clients have inquired whether it would be possible to include wind, solar, and hydroelectric energy assets in REITs. Mr. Kirshenbaum says it isn't clear that would work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Politicians have said little about REITs in this election cycle, but perceived abuses have landed in the political cross hairs before. When Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney was governor of Massachusetts, the state cracked down on banks that had set up REIT subsidiaries to cut their tax bills. Mr. Romney has said he would look to eliminate some tax breaks if he became president, but he hasn't been specific.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market showed broad improvement as the economy continued to expand modestly in late August and September, the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">The Fed</span>'s "beige book" report reinforced a host of recent data suggesting the housing market's recovery is picking up steam. The report, which is based on anecdotes from business contacts and economists, said existing-home sales strengthened in all 12 Fed districts, while selling prices rose or held steady.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In general, the Fed noted that economic activity "generally expanded modestly" since its last report, with consumer spending inching up or staying level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some districts noted that uncertainty over the presidential election, the U.S. budget outlook and the European sovereign-debt crisis were keeping some employers from hiring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economic snapshot was prepared by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of New York</span> based on information gathered on or before Sept. 28 and will be used for discussions at the Fed's next policy meeting, Oct. 23 and 24.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The beige book observed that "residential real estate showed widespread improvement since the last report." That is in line with data showing a nascent firming in a sector once rocked by the collapse in housing prices and the recession. Sales of previously occupied homes reached their highest level in more than two years in August, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">The Fed</span> noted that shrinking inventories of houses helped push up prices in some districts. Some regions saw robust growth in the construction of multi-family units. The commercial real-estate market was "mixed," with some softening in the office market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At its policy meeting in September, the Fed took action to boost the housing market. The <span class="companylink">central bank</span> launched a bond-buying program, under which it will purchase an additional $40 billion of mortgage-backed securities each month until the labor market significantly improves. <span class="companylink">The Fed</span> opted to buy mortgage-backed securities to help put downward pressure on mortgage interest rates.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Eliot Brown </div><div>1014 words</div><div>10 October 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The expected sale of a hulking, brick office tower in Midtown Manhattan is on track to net its seller the largest dollar profit to date on any single property that was purchased during the financial downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it isn't one of the big names in real estate, like Sam Zell or <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>, that is poised to rake in hundreds of millions of dollars in profit from a quick sale of the copper-crowned One Worldwide Plaza. Instead, it is a group of investors led by a relatively obscure New York landlord, <span class="companylink">George Comfort &amp; Sons Inc</span>., which purchased the building in 2009 for about $600 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George Comfort, which declined to comment on the sale, has received multiple preliminary bids of well over $1 billion, according to real-estate executives informed of the status. The seller's target price for the 1.8 million-square-foot tower on Eighth Avenue is $1.5 billion, and final bids are due Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As commercial-property values continue to rise in major cities around the U.S., gutsy investors who bought office buildings, hotels, stores and apartments when the commercial real-estate market hit bottom following the recession are making huge profits by selling them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Values of top-quality properties, which fell 38% in the early years of the downturn, are now within 4% of the record highs hit in 2007, according to an index by real-estate research firm Green Street Advisors Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in values is being fueled largely by ever-lower interest rates, which has made debt financing cheaper and helped push up demand for real estate by investors searching for investments with good yields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, more credit is becoming available. At the beginning of the year analysts projected that $30 billion to $40 billion of new commercial mortgage-backed securities would be issued in 2012. Now some analysts are saying the figure could rise as high as $45 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current cast of bottom feeders that are taking advantage of the sharp rise in prices looks different from those that swooped in during the prior real-estate mess in the early 1990s. Back then, it was largely big institutions like <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">General Electric Capital Corp</span>. and a venture of Mr. Zell and <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span> that purchased big portfolios of distressed debt and properties from lenders and the U.S.-controlled <span class="companylink">Resolution Trust Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time, while some big names like <span class="companylink">Starwood Capital Group</span> and <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span> did buy at the bottom, much of the quick selling is being done by lesser-known midsize players like George Comfort, which relied on their knowledge of local markets to snap up what are turning out to be huge bargains. Others include San Francisco-based TMG Partners, which made a set of well-time investments in that city's South of Market neighborhood; Savanna, a New York company that bought numerous older Manhattan office buildings; and Pacific Urban Residential, which turned around a big profit on a complex of apartment buildings in the Seattle area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We were not quite sure when [the economy] would get better, but we knew at those prices, we couldn't lose money," said Michael Covarrubias, TMG's chairman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason for the success of these investors is that many of the pension funds and insurance companies that were active in the boom pulled back from real estate when prices were cheap. Also, some of the larger private-equity firms stayed on the sideline when the market hit bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The opportunities to buy were "risks that institutional capital was not willing to take in 2009 and 2010," said Dan Fasulo, managing director at the research firm <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zell and others have acknowledged that they were expecting lenders to dump assets in the same way they did in the early 1990s. But that never happened in large part because banks and other financial institutions this time were much more prone to extend troubled loans rather than foreclose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since hitting their trough in May 2009, commercial-property values have risen 57%, according to Green Street. To date, the largest single-building turnaround since the recession was the 42-story Seattle office building that was headquarters of <span class="companylink">Washington Mutual Inc</span>. until the bank failed and vacated the tower, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>. <span class="companylink">Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co</span>. bought the building in 2009 for $115 million, filled it with new tenants and sold it in April for $480 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices haven't rebounded broadly, as properties in suburbs and smaller cities generally are trailing those in prime locations like New York, Chicago and San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In those cities, high demand has pushed initial yields on some properties, particularly apartment buildings, down to 3% and even lower. High demand has led owners to put buildings up for sale. For example, <span class="companylink">Sony Corp</span>. recently tapped <span class="companylink">Eastdil Secured LLC</span> to market its Midtown Manhattan office tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George Comfort increased the occupancy of Worldwide Plaza, which was half vacant when the firm bought it, by leasing most of the empty space by luring <span class="companylink">Nomura Holdings Inc</span>. from downtown Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That empty space was a big reason the price was so low. "There were very, very few that would even look at that deal who would accept that kind of risk," said Douglas Harmon, of Eastdil, which is marketing Worldwide Plaza.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But values of properties in major cities also have been increasing faster than the buildings' income streams. And in some cases, investors didn't do much to the properties and still reaped big profits from selling them quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, a venture of TMG and DivcoWest recently sold an empty office building in San Francisco's gritty mid-Market neighborhood to <span class="companylink">Dolby Laboratories Inc</span>. for $110 million, more than double the amount they paid just last year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">French Fashion Brand</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gone Wild About NYC</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zadig &amp; Voltaire, a French fashion brand, has hinted at plans to kick off its U.S. expansion with a New York flagship. Now those schemes have become reality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company has signed a lease for its U.S. flagship, at the corner of Mercer and Broome streets in SoHo, according to real-estate executives familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company already has locations at 153 Mercer St. in SoHo, as well as on Bleecker Street, Madison Avenue and the Meatpacking District. The store at Mercer and Broome, with 4,500-square-feet of ground-floor space and a 5,000-square-foot basement, will be Zadig &amp; Voltaire's largest in the U.S., in a high-profile spot formerly occupied by <span class="companylink">Gourmet Garage</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zadig &amp; Voltaire is "moving into the states right now," Thierry Gillier, the company's chief executive and founder, told The Wall Street Journal in September. He hinted then that the company would be opening its fourth store in New York, and its U.S. flagship. "New York is a good place for Zadig because it's wild; there is this energy in New York," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SoHo has become increasingly desirable for high-fashion companies, including Alexander Wang and Vivian Tam, thanks to a mix of affluent residents and European tourists.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Armani Comes to City Point</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Armani Exchange will be the first retailer to open in the recently completed first phase of the massive City Point project in downtown Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The affordable, youth-focused stepchild of the famous fashion label has signed a lease for 6,500 square feet on the corner of Fulton and Gold streets and will open in November, in time for the Christmas shopping season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Armani Exchange, created by Italian designer <span class="companylink">Giorgio Armani</span>, opened its first store in SoHo in 1991. The brand now has 13 stores in the New York area, including one other location in Brooklyn at Kings Plaza.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Brooklyn is an energetic and vibrant place with fashion-minded young people, perfect for the Armani Exchange brand and lifestyle," said Harlan Bratcher, president and chief executive of Armani Exchange, in a written statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The City Point project is one of the largest developments under way in Brooklyn. Its plan calls for 1.6 million square feet of retail, office and residential space to be built by 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This spring, Century 21, the popular discount designer retailer, signed a 125,000-square-foot deal to anchor City Point, which is being developed by a partnership led by <span class="companylink">Acadia Realty Trust</span>. That store isn't set to open until the fall of 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Armani Exchange's new location will face onto Fulton Street, a strip that has seen a dramatic transformation from a collection of cheap cellphone outlets and fast-food joints into Brooklyn's main answer to Manhattan's popular shopping districts. Gap, Aldo, <span class="companylink">H&amp;M</span> and Shake Shack have opened or signed deals on the Fulton Mall in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"City Point is the perfect project to reflect the diversity of downtown Brooklyn today and is a centerpiece in the area's resurgence," said Downtown Brooklyn Partnership President Tucker Reed, in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Laura Kusisto</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Upper West Side Price Hike</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strong demand for rental apartment buildings is driving prices higher and convincing more owners to put property on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider the 12-story building at 2410-2418 Broadway which has 46 apartments and 4,300 square feet of retail space. The 13-person partnership that has owned it for 70 years has put it up for sale through Eastern Consolidated and Besen &amp; Associates, with a price tag of $52.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a buyer pays that amount, their initial return will be less than 3%, a low so-called "capitalization rate" even for the trendy Upper West Side. "In the past five to six months, there's been a lot of transactions at low cap rates -- 3% and even high twos," Patricia Garcia, of Eastern Consolidated, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She added that the building's main appeal is that it is on a prime corner at Broadway and West 89th Street. Also the apartments "are extraordinarily big and renting at lower than average rents at the moment."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All but one of the building's 46 residential units is occupied, and 71% are rent regulated, with average monthly rents of $1,294.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tech industry is going south.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In growing numbers, Silicon Valley executives—long based in tech strongholds like Santa Clara and Palo Alto—are buying homes in Los Angeles, as the lines between the technology and entertainment businesses grow blurrier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Venture capitalist and hedge-fund manager Peter Thiel—<span class="companylink">PayPal</span>'s co-founder and <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>'s earliest investor—paid $11.5 million in January for a 6,000-square-foot house on a promontory above the Sunset Strip. Andrew Frame, a 30-something entrepreneur who founded Internet-telephone company Ooma, bought a contemporary four bedroom in Bel Air for $5.5 million last summer from singer/reality star Nick Lachey, who in turn had acquired the home from model Heidi Klum and singer Seal. In March of last year, Matt Jacobson, head of market development at <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, paid $10.9 million for a modern house on the ocean in Manhattan Beach, according to public records. He uses his former home, a just-under 900-square-foot beach bungalow two blocks away, to house <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> employees visiting from up north.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's the <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> flop house," Mr. Jacobson jokes. "We have a surf in the morning before going into the office."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The southern migration is taking place as companies like <span class="companylink">Google</span> and <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> beef up their presence and more Silicon Valley investors and entrepreneurs establish footholds in the entertainment industry. Prices are soaring in the beachfront communities tech types favor, and rents in these areas are growing at a faster rate than in other parts of the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is a feeling that techies are the new celebrities," says Eric Kuhn, an agent who heads the social-media department at <span class="companylink">United Talent Agency</span>. "When I arrived in Hollywood, everybody had written a screenplay," he says. "Now, everyone has an app."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kurt Rappaport, a Los Angeles broker specializing in luxury real estate, says the number of his house-hunting clients from Silicon Valley has doubled over the past couple of years. Earlier this year, Mr. Rappaport sold a beach cottage in Malibu to a <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> executive for $6.8 million. Another client, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, just closed on a deal to buy ex-<span class="companylink">Yahoo</span> CEO Terry Semel's compound in Malibu for $37 million—Mr. Ellison's 27th Malibu property purchase, says Mr. Rappaport. Mr. Ellison did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It isn't just Silicon Valley-based techies who are buying. Last summer, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss—twins best known for suing Mark Zuckerberg over the origins of <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, and who recently formed a venture-capital firm—bought an 8,000-square-foot bachelor pad in the Hollywood Hills for $18 million. Ted Waitt, co-founder of computer company Gateway, also bought in Bel-Air, paying $14 million this past June for a six-bedroom Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another client of Mr. Rappaport's, Mich Mathews, formerly the head of marketing for <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> and a longtime Seattle resident, paid $11.5 million for a 12,000-square-foot home in Holmby Hills in March. From her new perch in Los Angeles, she's helping to launch a company that she says lies "at the intersection of marketing and digital entertainment, philanthropy and lifetime experiences." Ms. Mathews is currently remodeling the seven-bedroom home, adding a wine cellar and a cabana for the pool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 600 tech start-ups have sprung up in L.A. over the last few years, according to Represent.LA, an open-source project that tracks the growth of start-up communities, bringing with them engineers and executives looking for housing. The narrow, 3-mile strip of land that runs from Santa Monica through Venice, and is now stretching down to Playa Vista, has been dubbed "Silicon Beach" due to the heavy concentration of Internet companies and executives there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices have gone up dramatically on this beachfront strip. Previously known for an edgy vibe, the area has grown increasingly upscale with the arrival of gourmet restaurants and mainstream stores. In Santa Monica, the median price of homes jumped 16% in the first eight months of 2012 compared with 2011, after a 9% decline over the same period the year before, according to Multiple Listing Service data compiled by Paul Habibi, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. Venice's median home price in the first eight months of 2012 broke the $1 million barrier, rising to $1,012,000 from $899,000 in the first eight months of 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Los Angeles County, median home prices went up by just under 1% during the first eight months of 2012, compared with the same period in 2011, according to Mr. Habibi's MLS data. Nationwide, the median home price rose 3.3% during that time period to $186,000, according to <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>, and in California the median price rose 4.8% for that same time period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A substantial portion of Venice's real-estate boom is attributable to <span class="companylink">Google</span>. Last November, the Web-search giant opened a flashy new office in Venice to focus on engineering, sales and advertising; the company will lease close to a quarter-million square feet in the neighborhood by 2014. To create a campuslike setting for its more than 500 employees in L.A., the company took over a funky Frank Gehry complex resembling a pair of binoculars. Like <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s other locations, it offers amenities like a climbing wall and an outdoor movie theater, as well as bicycles and surfboards that can be rented during the workday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Want 300 days of sun a year?" <span class="companylink">Google</span> says on its website. "Forget the Valley—pack your bags for <span class="companylink">Google</span> L.A."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February, <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> signed a lease for about 40,000 square feet of production space in Playa Vista. It will open later this year. And in August 2011, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> began leasing about 13,000 square feet in Playa Vista.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The arrival of techies has also had a profound effect on the rental market, brokers and real-estate developers say. Kevin Miller, president of Westside Rentals, which bills itself as Southern California's largest home-finding service, says he has seen rents in Santa Monica and Venice increase by about 10% over the last 18 months—compared with other desirable areas such as Beverly Hills and Culver City, where he says rents increased by about 4% to 5%. Rents have increased by just 2% across Los Angeles over the same time period, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Entrepreneurs love being around other entrepreneurs, and that's driving demand toward the beach," says Mr. Miller. "Plus, people like to live near where they work, and the tech companies are there."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Silicon Valley buyers shop differently from other wealthy L.A. clients, brokers say. While entertainment moguls often rely on the taste, advice and social connections of the city's top brokers, tech executives frequently do their own research online before they arrive in town, and know what they want before they look.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Broker Mauricio Umansky recalls a moment earlier this year when he was showing several homes in the Hollywood Hills to an entrepreneur visiting from Northern California. "I was telling him that houses in the neighborhood sell for $1,000 per [square] foot. He interrupted me and said, 'No, they sell for $936 per foot.' He was testing me. It totally caught me off guard. And by the way, he was right." Mr. Umansky, who is the CEO of real-estate firm the Agency, adds that many buyers from up north often shy away from relying on the taste of others, preferring instead to rely on themselves. "They will challenge your knowledge of the market," he says. "And only if you pass will they trust you." In the end, he sold an $8 million home in the Hollywood Hills to the entrepreneur.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The business interests of Hollywood and Silicon Valley continue to converge. Tech companies are becoming distributors of studio content; <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>, iTunes and Netflix have all licensed content from major entertainment players. Talent agencies CAA and WME are incubating start-ups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's so much more traffic between these two worlds of tech and entertainment that we're seeing the social worlds blend together, and that's luring the Northern California community to buy homes down here," says Ben Silverman, former co-chairman of NBC Entertainment. "These days, there are more Internet guys at the Vanity Fair Oscar party than traditional media players."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">South African-born billionaire Elon Musk, who co-founded <span class="companylink">PayPal</span> and <span class="companylink">Tesla Motors</span>, has also dabbled in the film business, serving as an executive producer on films like "Thank You for Smoking." He commutes back and forth on his Dassault Falcon between the Bay Area and Los Angeles. According to people close to the situation, Mr. Musk is in contract to buy the roughly the $20 million Bel-Air house he has been renting—a 20,000-square-foot estate on a private knoll with a home theater, library, lighted tennis court, gym, pool and 1,000-bottle wine cellar. Representatives for Mr. Musk declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More venture capitalists also are putting down roots. "For years, I would watch people launch their start-up in L.A., raise capital and move up north as soon as they got successful. Now, they get successful and they stay," says Paul Bricault, a venture capitalist who founded one of Los Angeles's largest accelerators and lives in Venice. After years of traveling to Los Angeles once every few months, Timothy Draper, founder and a managing director of <span class="companylink">Draper Fisher Jurvetson</span>, says he now flies down to L.A. about twice a month—often enough that he bought a house in west Los Angeles this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I thought, 'Why leave all the activity here to compete with everyone else in NorCal?' " says Mark Suster, a venture capitalist who started leasing in Pacific Palisades two years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another factor: Even as prices have begun to creep up in neighborhoods like Venice, L.A.'s real-estate prices still tend to be substantially lower than those in desirable parts of Silicon Valley. In Palo Alto, the median price paid for single-family homes was $1.7 million in the first eight months of 2012, a 20.4% increase over the same period in 2011, according to <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We had a great time looking for a house in L.A., especially after living up north," says Sonya Merrill, an ex-<span class="companylink">Google</span> executive who moved to L.A. with her husband, Douglas, a former Google chief information officer, in late 2008. "Silicon Valley is all 1960s and '70s tract houses or small bungalows—it's a sea of blah. Expensive blah—I once looked at a teardown in Palo Alto that smelled like urine and was made of cinder block. It was on the market for $1.5 million and there was a bidding war for it." The couple spent $2.8 million on a Hollywood Hills four-bedroom home where actor Bela Lugosi long resided. They spent another year redoing it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some tech moguls, including Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, venture capitalist Ray Lane and Mr. Ellison, have owned property in Los Angeles for years. David Sacks, a corporate vice president at <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>, owns a Beverly Hills house where Quentin Tarantino filmed "Pulp Fiction."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the newest wave of Silicon Valley arrivals is heavily favoring the Silicon Beach area. Viddy, a mobile-video-sharing company, has its office a block from <span class="companylink">Google</span> in Venice. About a fifth of new employees have relocated from Silicon Valley, says Brett O'Brien, Viddy's CEO and co-founder. One of Viddy's other co-founders, Chris Ovitz, in January paid $1.6 million for a loft on Venice's main thoroughfare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers are scrambling to cater to the influx. Jim Andersen, president of prolific Westside developer NMS Properties, says the firm is opening five more buildings not far from the offices of <span class="companylink">Google</span> and <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span>, among other tech firms. He added that NMS has begun building smaller apartments to better serve young renters who are part of the tech scene.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim Jacobsen, a commercial-real-estate broker, says he first built one of his projects—a warehouse in Venice converted into 30 lofts for both working and living—with entertainment-industry folks in mind. But with just a month or so until the units, which run between $500,000 and $2 million, hit the market, he is advertising them to people in the technology industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Umansky, who sold two homes in Los Angeles this year to <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> executives, has another explanation for why Silicon Valley executives are heading south.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of these guys are young, they have cashed out, they are bachelors, they like to party," he says. "And let's be honest, the partying in Hollywood is way better than in Silicon Valley."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Alyssa Abkowitz </div><div>1201 words</div><div>5 October 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No property taxes for five years. No closing fees and no capital-gains taxes. With a blitz of housing incentives set to expire Dec. 31, Puerto Rico is courting high-end home buyers -- and sparking a real-estate revival.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Puerto Rican government introduced the aggressive incentives two years ago to boost the island's flagging housing market. The stimulus seems to be working: New-home sales were up 51% by volume in 2011 and 38% for the first six months of 2012, compared with 2010, when the incentives were enacted, according to the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stimulus means a buyer who purchases a $1 million home will save about $25,500 in closing costs and property taxes. And a homeowner who rents out the property can waive rental-income taxes through 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The incentives apply only to new homes, and the buyer must hold on to the property for a minimum of six months in order to waive capital-gains taxes upon selling. (There are also some incentives for buyers of existing properties.) Currently, the Dec. 31 expiration date targets only buyers of second homes; the incentives will continue for primary-home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the incentives have warmed up the market, asking prices remain 30% below what they were during the market's peak seven years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The island's real-estate community is hoping the program will bring Puerto Rico back to its glamour days. In the late 1950s, financier and conservationist Laurance Rockefeller opened a resort west of San Juan that attracted actresses like Ava Gardner and Elizabeth Taylor, and post-World War II presidents like John F. Kennedy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, it remains to be seen whether the commonwealth can reclaim its stylish mystique. That's because for the past two decades, Puerto Rico has focused on the cruise-ship crowd and only recently found its footing in multimillion-dollar properties, says Ani Gonzalez Brunet, a broker in San Juan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Acquamarina, a 47-unit development designed by Enrique Gutierrez, the architect behind Miami's Bacardi buildings, is one of the newest offerings in San Juan's Condado neighborhood. Located on Ashford Avenue, San Juan's equivalent of Rodeo Drive, the terraced building is walking distance to Cartier, Ferragamo and Budatai, one of the top Latin-fusion restaurants on the island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When plans were released in 2006, the building's options sold out quickly. But the real-estate market tanked in 2008, and many Acquamarina buyers pulled out, leaving the property virtually empty when it opened in 2009. The recent tax incentives have spurred sales in the development, as did an exclusive affiliation between its sole seller, Trillion Realty Group, and Christie's International Real Estate. Today, three units remain, including the $5 million resale of the 8,379-square-foot, three-story penthouse with an elevator, floor-to-ceiling windows and an infinity pool overlooking the ocean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Competition is sizzling on opposite coasts, where two luxury developers are vying for the same buyers. Built on former coconut plantations, both family-developed properties are marketing their gated communities to eco-friendly buyers, a message that is in sync with recent green initiatives pushed by Gov. Luis Fortuno.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirty-five minutes west of San Juan is Dorado Beach, a Ritz-Carlton Reserve, built by the family-owned Stubbe Organization and the Caribbean Property Group. In addition to a hotel, there are two residential sections: On West Beach, 13 condos have been built, and a second phase of 14 additional condos, priced from $2.5 million, is in progress. On East Beach, there will be 10 single-family villas starting at $4 million. When the development opens in December, homeowners will get to borrow artwork through a partnership with the nonprofit Art Production Fund. There's also an eco-adventure program in the works that will include snorkeling, hiking and wetland tours. The <span class="companylink">Ritz-Carlton</span> and the Stubbe Organization declined to elaborate on the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the opposite end of the island, 27 miles from San Juan, sits Bahia Beach Resort &amp; Golf Club, a 483-acre resort on the edge of the El Yunque rain forest. Developers are emphasizing exclusivity and the natural surroundings by keeping 65% of its land undeveloped and capping heights on residences at below tree level. The St. Regis-branded properties at Bahia, developed by Puerto Rico's Interlink Group, are on a private island with 26 lots, 16 of which are still available. Prices for homes on the island start at $3.5 million. St. Louis Cardinals outfielder Carlos Beltran and former boxer Oscar De La Hoya have built tropical plantation-style homes here that include infinity pools, travertine floors, lily ponds and coral-stone terraces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bahia's environmental focus has earned it a certification from Audubon International, meaning the developer takes specific measures to help preserve the environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The environmental efforts are what attracted Marie Helene Reinhold, a jewelry-store owner with homes in San Juan and Sun Valley, Idaho, to build a 9,200-square-foot home with her husband on Bahia's private island. Ms. Reinhold says she enjoys feeding the birds, eating at Fern, chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten's restaurant on the property, and watching turtles lay eggs on the beach. "I've lived in Puerto Rico for 40 years and didn't know such beauty existed here," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Puerto Rico's renaissance has experienced its share of growing pains. Airlines increased the number of flights to the island before new roads had been built, so travel times are longer than expected. High-end developments have round-the-clock security, but the island has seen crime rates rise in recent years, mostly attributed to drug trafficking and an unemployment rate that has been above 13% since December 2008. And while the allure of traveling without a U.S. passport attracts some people, it can be off-putting to others who view Puerto Rico as a destination for less-well-heeled tourists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Leticia Brunet Gonzalez, a principal owner at Trillion Realty Group, likens the island's recent ascendancy to a prized Gucci bag: "It was put in the drawer while people tried something else. Now they're taking it back out."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Want to sell your house fast? It's not what you say, it's how you say it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houses that real-estate agents describe as "move-in condition" sell 12% faster than homes listed without those words. "Starter homes" sell 9% faster. But be careful: A house called a "handyman special" sells about 50% faster, but the final price is 30% lower than listings that lack those words.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the past decade, Paul Anglin, associate professor of real estate at the University of Guelph in Ontario, has been studying the effect of certain words in house descriptions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the worst offenders is "motivated" sellers, which both lowers the sell price and slows the sale. Oddly, frantic pleas of "must sell" have no effect on sell time or price, Prof. Anglin says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a 2005 National Bureau of Economic Research study, words that depict distinct attributes -- "granite," "maple" and "gourmet" -- correspond with higher sale prices. Words deemed "superficially positive" -- like "clean," "quiet," "fantastic" and "charming" -- are either ineffective or even hurt prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate study, words that describe specific attributes are more likely to boost the selling price: Mentioning "garage" increases the sale price by 9.8%, "fireplace" by 6.8% and "lake" by 5.6%, says Thomas Thomson, a professor of real estate and finance at the University of Texas at San Antonio who co-wrote "Real Estate Agent Remarks: Help or Hype?"</p>

</div><div class="author">By Craig Karmin, Robbie Whelan and Jeannette Neumann </div><div>664 words</div><div>4 October 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span> has become the biggest U.S. investor in single-family rental homes by spending more than $1 billion since the start of 2012 to acquire more than 6,500 foreclosed houses in eight metropolitan areas, according to people briefed by <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm also is finalizing a loan for at least $300 million from <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> to support this business, these people said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Numerous private-equity firms have crowded into the business, some as early as last year, looking for a way to bet on the recovery of the housing market. <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>'s growing commitment to this strategy offers fresh evidence that the purchases of foreclosed homes, which began as a mom-and-pop pursuit, is gaining legitimacy among the biggest private-equity firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The demand from these firms and other investors could help strengthen the housing recovery, analysts say. Earlier this year, the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> expressed support for the strategy as a way to clear the backlog of foreclosures that has weighed down the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People involved in the market estimate that private-equity firms and other investors have raised $6 billion to $8 billion to invest in the sector, as they try to take advantage of prices that have fallen nationwide on average by more than a third. That could buy 40,000 to 80,000 properties, according to a recent report from Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, success is by no means assured for private-equity firms, especially given their high targets for investment returns in general and their lack of experience with this type of real estate. Used to buying office buildings, shopping centers and other big properties, they may struggle to find economies of scale in managing thousands of individual homes in neighborhoods that were hard-hit by foreclosures, but are showing signs of price stabilization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Skeptics also have pointed out that bulk sales of repossessed homes are rarer and smaller than many investors had hoped. In many markets, firms are battling small investors at foreclosure auctions on courthouse steps, buying properties one by one, a tedious process. There also is little precedent for selling thousands of homes en masse, something the firms will need to do to cash out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> and other firms are expanding rapidly partly because the housing market is firming up. In some markets, home prices have risen to the point that firms might not be able to achieve their initial return objectives from renting them out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I believe the smart thing to do is to ramp up really quickly, because I think the dynamics are going to change dramatically in the next 12 months," said John Burns, an Irvine, Calif.-based housing consultant. "We're going to see a lot of price appreciation at the low end of the market, which means lower cash yields."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the private-equity firms crowding into the single-family home market are <span class="companylink">Colony Capital LLC</span>, <span class="companylink">Oaktree Capital Group LLC</span>, <span class="companylink">KKR &amp; Co</span>., GTIS Partners and <span class="companylink">Och-Ziff Capital Management LLC</span>, which have invested less money and bought fewer homes. On Wednesday, Waypoint Real Estate Group LLC, a real-estate investment firm in the single-family rental market, said it had secured a $245 million loan from <span class="companylink">Citigroup Inc</span>., to expand its portfolio of more than 2,400 homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>, one of the biggest buyout firms in the world, has been able to muscle its way to the front by taking advantage of the $13.3 billion property fund it closed last month, the largest of its kind ever raised, say people who have spoken with <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>. It has paid an average of about $140,000 for each home in Phoenix, southern and northern California, Atlanta, Miami, Tampa and Chicago.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jeannette Neumann and Nick Timiraos </div><div>852 words</div><div>3 October 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> is engaged in a tug of war with both its regulator and Wall Street over a plan to provide loans to investors that are buying homes in foreclosure to rent them out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government-backed mortgage giant is pushing to finance such investors to help jump-start a housing recovery. But the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> has put those plans on hold, concerned Freddie's cheap debt would make it difficult for banks to compete for the growing number of buyers of foreclosed homes, people familiar with the proposed financing said. The FHFA also worries Freddie's involvement would deepen the government's role in the nation's real-estate economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks want to keep Freddie out of the financing market, and have told the FHFA that they can provide ample loans to investors. Bankers say an FHFA decision to sideline Freddie could drive investors toward their loans and other services, generating fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If [Freddie] came along and offered funding, and it was on better terms, in all likelihood, the funding business would end up in their hands," says Steve Abrahams, a mortgage analyst at <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>. "The odds of it crowding out private participation are pretty high."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tensions over the initiative underline the conflicts within a housing market still recovering from its worst crisis in decades, with Freddie and its larger sibling, <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, banks and investors pulling in different directions. In addition, policy makers say they want to shrink the mortgage giants' role, but some economists have argued that any short-term steps the firms take to stimulate housing demand could make it easier to accomplish that long-term goal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Freddie's financing proposal is targeted to more established players with property management experience, not to investors looking to buy several foreclosed homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors have raised billions of dollars in equity to buy homes to then rent out. But debt, often a cheaper alternative, has remained scarce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By financing these purchases, Freddie could boost demand for foreclosed homes, investors say. Rising home prices would lift profits at Fannie and Freddie, which are selling tens of thousands of foreclosed homes every quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Financing from Freddie would be the greatest economic stimulus," says Aaron Edelheit, chief executive of American Home Real Estate Co., which owns more than 1,500 houses and is actively buying more. "You'd have the greatest land grab you've ever seen."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Freddie officials began work on a financing program early this year, seeking the advice of major real-estate firms and banks. Officials settled on a short-term loan program for investors buying foreclosed homes and a longer-term facility that would allow some to build up their inventory, according to people familiar with the plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This summer, Freddie's pilot program won the support of the Treasury Department, people familiar with the matter said. Some Treasury officials had favored increasing the size of the facility, the people said. A Treasury spokesman declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement, a Freddie spokeswoman said the company is exploring a financing program that "would provide important liquidity" to the single-family rental market. Any program "will need further internal analysis and approval by FHFA to determine if and when it can be brought to market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meg Burns, a top FHFA policy director, told attendees at a single-family rental conference in May that she was concerned any financing by Freddie would "crowd out" private capital, according to conference attendees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, the FHFA said the proposal couldn't move forward for the time being, according to people familiar with the matter. The agency said it wanted to study whether financing from Freddie would discourage banks from lending since the mortgage company's loans were likely to be less expensive for investors, those people said. The agency didn't provide a time frame.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edward DeMarco, the agency's acting director, declined to elaborate. "Where it is in the process, what is going to affect the final determination -- I just think it is premature for me to be talking about it," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices have picked up in recent months amid declines in the number of foreclosed homes that are hitting the market. Some economists say that a bigger hurdle facing would-be investors is the scarce supply of for-sale properties rather than the lack of financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More banks have begun looking into offering rental financing. In one recent deal, Waypoint Real Estate Group LLC borrowed $65 million from <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>. The Oakland, Calif.-based investor is working with the bank on a bigger, longer-term financing deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But loans to a handful of major firms doesn't mean the debt market is taking off, some investors and analysts say. "We've had a housing crisis in America since 2006," says Shekar Narasimhan, a former real-estate lending executive who now runs a consulting firm. "Has the banking system stepped in and said, 'We want to do this'? Not really."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment-rental market remained robust in the third quarter, but, with home sales improving, the sector is showing signs of losing steam, according to a new report from <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rental-apartment vacancy rate declined to 4.6% during the third quarter from 4.7% in the second, said Reis, a real-estate research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is the smallest quarterly improvement in the vacancy rate since the sector started recovering in early 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rents increased 0.8% in the third quarter to an average of $1,090 a month, according to Reis, which tracks trends in 79 markets. That is slower than the 1.1% increase in the second quarter but strong compared with historical averages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Fundamentals still remain relatively robust, particularly given the context of high unemployment and tepid economic growth," Reis said in its report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm said there are signs of cooling in the market, which has been one of the strongest real-estate sectors in recent years. Until now, demand has been brisk from people unwilling or unable to buy homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But recent signs of a rebound in home sales have stoked concern among apartment-building landlords and investors that demand could weaken.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Households may feel a greater impetus to consider buying homes while mortgage rates remain low," the Reis report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing experts say that it isn't clear whether the slowing pace in the third quarter was due to increasing home sales or the weak economy. "Renters might feel attracted to the possibility of buying," said Luis Mejia, director of multifamily research at the CoStar Group, which collects and analyzes commercial real-estate and economic data. But the "effect of the housing recovery on rental activity is something that is going to take longer to really become evident."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment-rental market also may be weakening because developers have responded to rising rents by adding supply. Research firm Zelman &amp; Associates expects 235,000 units to be started this year, followed by 285,000 in 2013 and 320,000 in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is cause for concern in the near term that demand is abating for multifamily, just as a veritable avalanche of new projects begins to open their doors early next year," Reis said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The largest increases in rent in the third quarter were seen in tech-heavy San Jose, Calif., as well as in New York, where the private sector is adding jobs faster than the rest of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jason Martin, 22 years old, said he is having trouble finding an apartment in New York, where he is looking to pay as much as $1,500 for his share of the monthly rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Things come up and you have to be able to move that day if you really want to get the place," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some renters are having an easier time in Miami, where the vacancy rate is 4.2% and the average rent is $1,072. Chris Mahannah, a financial analyst, said he had no problem finding a two-bedroom apartment in the heart of the city during the summer. "There are actually a lot of places," said Mr. Mahannah, 22.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked whether he is tempted to buy a home, Mr. Mahannah said for now he is content with renting. "I'm still trying to figure out career decisions and where I want to be," he said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Josh Mitchell   </div><div>814 words</div><div>2 October 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>7</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. manufacturers rebounded in September, with fresh data Monday showing factory activity expanded for the first time in four months despite weakening economies around the globe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management said its purchasing managers' index -- a gauge of the factory sector -- rose to 51.5 in September from 49.6 in August. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Details in the report were encouraging, with higher readings for new orders and employment. That could point to an increase in hiring and production in coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Comments from the panel reflect a mix of optimism over new orders beginning to pick up, and continued concern over soft global business conditions and an unsettled political environment," the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Good news within the U.S. ISM survey was the rebound in demand. The new-orders index rose to 52.3 from 47.1 in August. The exports index edged up to 48.5 from 47.0.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The production index continued to shrink, although it improved to 49.5 from 47.2. The employment index rose to 54.7 from 51.6.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, factories are continuing to take a hit on exports as demand for U.S.-made goods overseas declines amid sluggish economies around the world. The slower global economy is an important reason why the sector, while now appearing stronger than during the summer months, is still weaker than it was during the first three years of the recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM report indicated that manufacturers are concerned about growing risks to growth abroad and at home, including worsening conditions in Europe and the prospect of tax increases and spending cuts at home. Those anxieties were underscored Monday by other data showing further weakening in factory activity in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Euro-zone manufacturing activity shrank for the 14th straight month in September, and the number of people without jobs rose to a record, suggesting prospects are slim for a quick return to growth in the crisis-hit currency bloc. Data company Markit on Monday said its monthly poll of purchasing executives in the euro zone gave an index reading of 46.1 in September. That compares with 45.1 in August. Any number below 50 shows a decline in manufacturing activity. The decline eased in Germany but steepened markedly in France.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturing in China and Vietnam continued to contract last month, though at a slower pace than in August, while Indonesia's manufacturing sector kept expanding, but not as robustly as before. China's official manufacturing purchasing managers' index rose to 49.8 in September from 49.2 in August, lower than analysts' average forecasts for a reading of 50.2. The rise in the PMI followed four consecutive monthly declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brad Holcomb, who heads the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing survey, said the pickup in U.S. factory activity last month appeared to stem from demand for cars and a slight turnaround in the housing industry. Companies tied to those industries -- such as auto-parts suppliers and furniture makers -- drove the growth, Mr. Holcomb said. But he added that factory activity isn't likely to expand significantly in coming months given uncertainty in the global economy. "I wouldn't expect any major swings in the next few months," Mr. Holcomb said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, spending on construction projects slipped for the second straight month in August, even as private residential building reached its highest level in more than three years, showing the uneven nature of the sector's recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction spending fell 0.6% in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $837.09 billion as commercial and industrial building slipped, the Commerce Department said Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop, which was the biggest in more than a year, was unexpected. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast that spending would be up 0.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revised data showed construction outlays fell 0.4% in July to a rate of $842.02 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, year over year, construction spending was up 6.5% in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private residential construction jumped 0.9% from July to $273.47 billion -- the highest level since January 2009. Home building has been a bright spot of late. In August, new-home sales were up 27.7% from a year earlier, according to a separate Commerce report last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But private nonresidential building has fallen for three straight months. In August, it decreased 1.7% to $288.73 billion. Construction of offices, factories and power and communication infrastructure all fell. For the month, total private-sector construction spending fell 0.5% to $562.20 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">State and local governments decreased building by 0.9% in August to $249.68 billion. Federal construction was up 0.3% to $25.21 billion.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hundreds of Manhattan brokers have moved on to a new type of real-estate firm that allows the brokers to keep full commission payments for themselves, in exchange for low monthly fees and preset transaction charges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the largest of the new broker-friendly companies in Manhattan, <span class="companylink">Charles Rutenberg Realty LLC</span>, has been caught up in a struggle for control among the five partners who set up the company on a shoestring budget in 2006. One issue at stake: who has the right to open a Charles Rutenberg office in the hot Brooklyn real-estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They have been battling in court over dueling partnership agreements and allegations of fraud and misspent money. At one point Rutenberg bank accounts were briefly frozen because of the dispute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The brokerage model adopted by Rutenberg is in use across the country, but became popular in Manhattan only in recent years as technology was developed for brokerage companies to easily access each other's listings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Rutenberg, brokers pay a fixed fee of $99 month for access to Manhattan listings, use of a listing website, email and a telephone system. Many work from home. When they have a sale, brokers pay Rutenberg a transaction fee of $1,000 per sale, or $2,000 for sales of more than $1.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a traditional brokerage firm, inexperienced brokers typically get to keep about 50% of the commissions they earn. More experienced colleagues can receive up to 70%, or even more for high-selling brokers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Executives at large, traditional firms say they offer brokers, buyers and sellers powerful brands, with strong support for training, public relations and marketing. But brokers who sign up at the newer "100% commission" firms say that in the age of the Internet and cellphones, they don't need as much hand-holding as the traditional firms provide. And, of course, they like keeping the extra earnings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The best thing I ever did in real estate is move from what I call a dinosaur brokerage to Rutenberg," said Malcolm Carter, a broker and real-estate blogger. "I like the flexibility and independence it offers me and the way I am treated like an adult."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A survey this year by the Real Deal ranked Rutenberg, with more than 450 agents, as Manhattan's sixth-largest brokerage in terms of agents, but 11th in terms of the number and total value of listings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first Rutenberg brokerage business was incorporated in Clearwater, Fla., in 1999, and was named for Charles Rutenberg, a long-established Florida developer and home builder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A founder of <span class="companylink">Charles Rutenberg Realty</span> invited Richard Friedman, a real-estate investor and former Wall Street trader, to open a similar business in New York. Mr. Friedman brought in his then son-in-law and business partner, Jeffrey Markowitz, as well as Kathy Braddock and Paul Purcell, both former executives at what is now Prudential Douglas Elliman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A family trust set up by the owner of the Clearwater company retained a one-third interest in the new business, but without voting rights, according to court records. Joseph Moshe, a real-estate broker who controls the family trust, also opened up a separate Rutenberg business outside Manhattan in 2006, and has now signed up about 900 brokers in Westchester, Queens and on Long Island, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few years ago, as the Manhattan business became profitable, Rutenberg began making consulting payments to the voting members, but didn't give any profits to Mr. Moshe. In January, he sued in state Supreme Court in Manhattan seeking millions of dollars in damages, saying the other partners had improperly spent company money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Friedman filed a cross-complaint in July, saying that the other voting partners had improperly stripped him of his voting rights and consulting fees by using a version of the partnership agreement neither he nor the family trust had signed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He presented another partnership agreement, with the signatures of all the partners, and asked the court to declare that agreement valid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lisa Solbakken, a lawyer for Mr. Friedman, said that settlement discussions were in "the nascent stage." She said the dispute was simply about "who has the authorization to distribute the money" from a successful company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Markowitz's lawyer, Robert Piliero, said there was little doubt that the lawsuit "is all about vindictiveness" and has "nothing to do with any merits."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Braddock said that the dispute was part of the "growing pains" of a company that was put together informally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You can almost see it like a family business," she said. "Families have these disputes all of the time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile the discussions have included the right to open a Brooklyn office. Mr. Moshe said he retained all rights to do so. Mr. Purcell disputed this and said he hoped a settlement on that point could be worked out as part of an overall settlement.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European stocks retreated and the euro sank to a two-week low against the dollar as worry over Spain and Greece escalated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Stoxx Europe 600 index dropped 1.8% to 270.72, the lowest level since Sept. 5, the day before European Central Bank President Mario Draghi announced plans to buy the debt of fiscally weak euro-zone countries in unlimited quantities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The issue is that the markets, whether they have been supported by Draghi 'juice' or QE3, were looking like they needed support," said Philip Isherwood, European strategist at Absolute <span class="companylink">Strategy Research</span>. "The problem is that when you've got positive surprises you forget about risk, but poor economic data and bad macro news help to expose the risks."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comments by Charles Plosser, president of the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> Bank of Philadephia, made the mood more negative. Mr. Plosser suggested Tuesday that the Fed's new bond-buying program isn't likely to boost growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among major national indexes, the FTSE 100 dropped 1.6% to 5768.09 and France's CAC 40 index slid 2.8% to 3414.84. Germany's DAX 30 lost 2% to 7276.51, the biggest drop since early August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The yield on 10-year Spanish government bonds jumped to 6.03%, the highest level in almost three weeks, according to electronic-trading platform Tradeweb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surge in Spain's borrowing costs came following a call for early elections in the Catalonia region and antiausterity street protests, especially after Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said early-retirement programs would be restricted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greek trade unions embarked on a general strike over austerity measures. The government is preparing to present budget-cutting plans to euro-zone officials later this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The demonstrations raise a question about whether these countries will be able to follow through on their promises about austerity," said Brian Gendreau, market strategist for <span class="companylink">Cetera Financial</span>, which manages $20 billion in assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spain's IBEX 35 index sank the most among country-specific bourses in Europe, tumbling 3.9% to 7854.40. <span class="companylink">Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria</span> gave up 4.8%, while <span class="companylink">Banco de Sabadell</span> slid 4.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Risk-sensitive sectors, such as banks and resource firms, led the losses in Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Frankfurt, <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> posted the biggest loss and dropped 6.5%, while <span class="companylink">Commerzbank</span> slumped 5.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Paris, <span class="companylink">Credit Agricole</span> sank 7.5%, <span class="companylink">Societe Generale</span> dropped 6.4% and <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span> lost 5.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil group Total dropped 2.8%, as Chief Executive Christophe de Margerie told the <span class="companylink">Financial Times</span> that the risks of drilling oil in the Arctic waters are too high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In London, <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Scotland Group</span> sank 5.5% and <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> slid 4.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks also fell in the U.S., although the decline was far smaller, as the trouble in Europe worried investors and data on the housing market turned out to be weaker than expected. Early Wednesday afternoon in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 10 points, or 0.1%, to 13447.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index lost five points, or 0.4%, to 1436. The <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> Composite lost 22 points, or 0.7%, to 3095.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes declined in August, while economists had expected an increase. The measure fell 0.3% from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 373,000, the Commerce Department said. At the same time, though, the median price for a new home gained 17% from August 2011 reaching a level not seen since March 2007. Figures Tuesday showed that home prices have posted their strongest year-to-date gains since 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, three of the five biggest declines in the S&amp;P 500 were in homebuilders <span class="companylink">PulteGroup</span>, which lost 3.4%; <span class="companylink">Lennar</span>, down 2.8%; and <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span>, which fell 2.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Jabil Circuit</span> shares fell 9.4% after the company announced disappointing earnings.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos </div><div>805 words</div><div>26 September 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices in July posted their largest year-to-date gain in seven years, according to a report Tuesday that offered the latest confirmation of a broad housing-market pickup that began this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices rose by 1.2% from one year ago, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller index of 20 major metropolitan areas, the largest year-over-year gain since home-buyer tax credits fueled a burst of sales two years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But prices were up by 5.9% for the first seven months of the year, which was significantly better than increases of 0.4% and 2.1% for the same period in 2011 and 2010, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices rose in 16 of 20 metro areas tracked by the index when compared with one year ago, with the largest gains reported in Phoenix (16.6%), Minneapolis (6.4%) and Detroit (6.2%). Atlanta, Chicago, Las Vegas, and New York posted declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices typically rise during the summer, when sales are strongest. The Case-Shiller index measures prices using a three-month average and is reported with a two-month lag. The data released Tuesday covers prices recorded for the May-to-July period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices still stand nearly 30% below their 2006 peak, but that is an improvement over the 35% peak-to-trough decline recorded in February. Data last week showed that sales of previously owned homes and construction of single-family housing units had reached their highest levels in more than two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices began rallying earlier this year amid sharp declines in the number of properties listed for sale, particularly foreclosed homes that sell at larger discounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories remain low because investors have been buying up homes that can be converted as rentals while traditional home-sellers have opted to keep their properties off the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many sellers may be unable to sell because they owe more than their homes are worth, while others could be holding out for better prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate home-price index released by the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> on Monday showed that prices rose by 3.7% from one year ago in July. Prices rose by 0.2% from June on a seasonally adjusted basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The news on home prices in this report confirm recent good news about housing," said David M. Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&amp;P <span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> Indices. He said single-family housing starts are well ahead of last year's pace, existing-home sales are up, the inventory of homes for sale is down and foreclosure activity is slowing. "All in all, we are more optimistic about housing," he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Blitzer also said that among the cities, Miami and Phoenix are both well off their bottoms, with positive monthly gains since the end of 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a year-to-year basis, the 10-city index and 20-city index were up 0.6% and 1.2%, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Conference Board, a private research group, said its index of consumer confidence rose nine points to 70.3 this month from a revised 61.3 in August, first reported as 60.6.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest index was far better than the 65.0 expected by economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gain echoes good September readings on how consumers view the economy reported earlier this month by the <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Canada</span> and Thomson Reuters-University of Michigan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Better consumer confidence should lead to stronger consumer spending, which accounts for the bulk of U.S. economic activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within the Conference Board's report, the present-situation index, a gauge of consumers' assessment of current economic conditions, rose to 50.2 from a revised 46.5, originally put at 45.8.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer expectations for economic activity over the next six months jumped to 83.7 from a revised 71.1, first reported as 70.5. The index is also at its highest since February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers were slightly more upbeat about current labor-market conditions, which is a positive indicator for September payrolls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The board's survey showed 8.3% of respondents now think jobs are "plentiful," up from 7.2% thinking that in August. Another 39.9% think jobs are "hard to get" down from 40.6% last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The jump in the expectations index can be traced to consumers' outlook for future labor conditions. The results show 18.5% think there will be more jobs in the next six months, up from 15.8% thinking that in August. A similar 18.5% think there will be fewer jobs, but that is down from 23.7% saying that last month.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos </div><div>479 words</div><div>26 September 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are many ways to measure changes in home prices, but the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller index has become many economists' favored benchmark in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Case-Shiller isn't as comprehensive or as timely as other indexes -- it tracks just 20 metropolitan areas and reports on a two-month delay -- it was among the first indexes to employ what is known as a "repeat sales" methodology, measuring prices of the same homes that have two or more recorded sales. Home-sales pairs are accumulated in rolling three-month periods to keep sample sizes large enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before Case-Shiller, the most widely watched home-price measure was produced by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>, which provides a median sales price, or the midpoint in price for thousands of different types of homes in hundreds of locations that sell in a given period. Median prices can be skewed when there is a shift in the "mix" of what is selling: The number can turn higher in months where more expensive homes are sold, for example, revealing little about the direction of prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other home-price indexes, including one maintained by data firm <span class="companylink">CoreLogic Inc</span>. and another by the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span>, also produce repeat-sales measures and are pointing to a home-price rebound. Each of the repeat-sales indexes has a slightly different recipe. <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>'s covers transactions in about 80% of the country, a wider look than Case-Shiller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FHFA index is derived from sales of homes on which mortgage giants <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> guarantee or purchase the loan. As a result, it didn't track more expensive homes during the housing bubble, because Fannie and Freddie can't guarantee loans that exceed a certain limit. It also didn't include loans financed by subprime lenders that weren't selling loans to Fannie and Freddie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FHFA index is unit-weighted, meaning all sales count equally, while Case-Shiller is value-weighted, giving greater emphasis to more expensive properties. This means high-cost markets such New York and Los Angeles have an outsize effect on the Case-Shiller reading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each of the indexes showed home prices peaked at about the same time, just as each is showing prices now bouncing along a bottom. But the degree varies considerably. The FHFA index shows prices rose 34% from 2003 to 2007 and that they are now about 16% below their peak. Case-Shiller, meanwhile, shows a 52% gain from 2003 until peaking in mid-2006. Prices are still about 30% off their peak.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">A Strip-Mall Revival</span>
</div><div class="author">By A.D. Pruitt </div><div>743 words</div><div>26 September 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C11</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strip-mall owners are dusting off projects that were shelved during the economic downturn, thanks partly to the expansion of discount chains like <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span>, Target and Family Dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently, development has been sluggish in the retail sector, which has faced persistently high vacancy rates because of competition from Internet shopping and overbuilding during the boom years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only five million square feet of new retail space was developed over the past 12 months nationwide, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is minuscule compared with the nearly 200 million square feet of retail space developed in 2006 during the peak of the market, according to ICSC. But activity is picking up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Regency Centers Corp</span>., <span class="companylink">Weingarten Realty Investors</span> and Brixmor Property Group, a subsidiary of <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span>, recently revived mothballed shopping-center projects in suburban areas. Some are even pursuing new ground-up development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These projects are moving forward partly because some of the companies already owned the land or were midway through construction when the downturn hit. For example, Weingarten is ramping up construction on eight shopping centers that broke ground in 2005 and 2006 and were delayed during the downturn because there weren't enough retailers and some demanded below-market rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Houston-based real-estate investment trust is aiming to complete most of the $200 million in development over the next two years -- including strip malls in Memphis, Tenn., Sheridan, Colo., and Tomball, Texas, that will have more than 200,000 square feet each.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weingarten also has broken ground over the past year on three new ground-up developments, including a 272,000-square-foot, grocery-anchored shopping center in Alexandria, Va., on vacant land it purchased with a joint venture partner. This is the company's first strip mall in the Washington metropolitan area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think it will be a very long time before there is a significant amount of construction that occurs on sites where there hasn't been something going on before," said Drew Alexander, chief executive of Weingarten. "Until we see significant population growth, employment growth . . . the vast majority of new development will be taking things off the shelf that were already started."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retail developers also are responding to a pickup in demand for retail centers anchored by grocery stores. While vacancy rates remain high, strip-mall vacancies in the second quarter declined 0.2 percentage point from a year earlier to 10.8%, according to <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>., a real-estate research firm. That rate was 0.1 point lower than the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, many strip malls, especially those in low-income neighborhoods and towns hurt by the housing bust, still struggle with high vacancies and face increased Internet competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the expansion of discount chains is helping to unclog some of the development pipeline amid a dearth of new strip malls. <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart Stores Inc</span>. plans to open between 180 and 200 new stores by the end of its fiscal year in January 2013. <span class="companylink">Family Dollar Stores Inc</span>. opened over 400 new stores this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Regency Centers</span>, one of the largest grocery-anchored strip-mall REITs, is using two parcels of vacant land it purchased during the past 18 months in Denver and Seattle suburbs to build grocery-anchored centers. The original owners planned to build a mixed-use development and lifestyle center, respectively, on the sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many retail landlords during the boom years opened lifestyle centers or open-air shopping malls with upscale retailers, but the concept fell out favor in tough economic times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are "able to revitalize these projects," said Hap Stein, chief executive of Regency. "It made more sense for traditional shopping centers than lifestyle centers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regency, based in Jacksonville, Fla., owns more than 300 strip malls and was one of the hardest hit retail REITs during the downturn partly because the company overbuilt in communities hobbled by the housing crash, particularly in California and Florida. The company's strip malls also were pressured by struggling mom-and-pop tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stein said the company now is focused on more-densely populated markets that aren't dependent on new housing. Regency still has about $60 million of land held for development. "I think there is a reasonably good chance to develop that property," Mr. Stein said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even amid a clear improvement in the U.S. housing market, the strength of home builders' recent results has been remarkable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider <span class="companylink">Lennar</span>. For the quarter ended in August, it said it delivered 3,655 homes, up 28% from a year earlier. Orders rose 44% to 4,198 homes, while the company's backlog grew 79% to 4,513. In one sign of just how sharp the sector's turn of fortunes has been, <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> noted in its earnings call that in some markets, it is seeing labor shortages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At this point, investors can legitimately ask how much longer home builders' business can continue to surge -- which may be why <span class="companylink">Lennar</span>'s stock fell 1.5% even though the company beat analysts' estimates by a wide mark. Valuations are now steep, with the top 10 home builders by market capitalization trading at 2.7 times book value, on average, from 1.5 times at the start of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But before declaring the S&amp;P home-builder index's 91% 12-month rally over, it is important to recognize how much stronger a market position the large home builders enjoy relative to any point in the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historically, one of the downsides to the home-building business has been that the barriers to entry were low: A little capital and a willing lender and a journeyman might strike out on his own. And while there were some benefits to being big, like the ability to secure large tracts of land, the economies of scale that give large firms so much of an advantage in other industries have never really applied so clearly in home construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there has been a great hollowing out in the home-building sector. In the fourth quarter of last year, there were 86,736 (mostly tiny) contracting firms engaged in single-family home construction, according to the Labor Department. Not only was that significantly below the fourth-quarter 2006 (housing-bubble) peak of 125,911, it was well below the fourth-quarter 2001 level of 107,643.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Large public home builders had some difficult years in the wilderness after the housing bubble burst, but unlike many of their small, private counterparts, they still are standing. So, beyond the gains that they are seeing from the overall turn higher in sales, they also stand to take a significantly larger share of the market than before the bubble burst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, the ability of private builders to get new projects under way, and for new firms to enter the fray, continues to be constrained by a lending climate that is tough on smaller firms of all stripes. In the second quarter, banks held $280 billion in commercial-industrial loans with balances of $1 million or less, according to the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp</span>., down from $327 billion at the end of 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the smaller fry struggle to get financing, the large builders have taken advantage of the sparse competition for prime building sites. <span class="companylink">Lennar</span>, for example, said it bought 8,300 new lots for $339 million in its latest quarter, deepening its land bank and positioning it well for when the housing market is healthy again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And remember that the housing market, while better, still is weak. So far this year, new home sales are about 40% below the pace they ran during the 1980s. It may be early innings yet.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mad Men Move South</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Madison Avenue, of course, is the spiritual home of the city's advertising industry. But for many growing high-tech ad firms Midtown South is the preferred location.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take the case of the New York office of LBi International, the Amsterdam-based digital ad agency that's located at 11 W. 19th St., between Fifth and Sixth avenues. LBi just signed a lease for an additional 26,000 square feet in the building increasing its occupancy to 78,000 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This neighborhood is a thriving area for different agencies and start-ups," says Judith Carr, the president of LBi in the U.S. "We wanted to make sure we were in the heart of the business industry."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LBi, which counts <span class="companylink">Coca-Cola</span>, <span class="companylink">Johnson &amp; Johnson</span>, <span class="companylink">Sony</span> and <span class="companylink">Virgin Atlantic</span> among its clients, expects to employ about 400 workers in the city when its new space is fully occupied in late 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm was in the news for another reason last week: French ad giant <span class="companylink">Publicis Groupe SA</span> said it had offered to buy all the outstanding shares in the company for 416 million euros ($543 million). The offer, the latest sign of a consolidation wave in the ad business, is being supported by LBi's management and supervisory boards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Midtown South has recently experienced a surge in leasing activity, particularly from start-ups and tech companies. Though the vacancy rate in Midtown has been flat over the last 12 months, Midtown South has seen its vacancy rate decline to 6.3% from 7.2%, according to a report by Cushman &amp; Wakefield, which represented LBi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Savitt Partners negotiated the lease on behalf of the building ownership at 11 W. 19th St. Other major tenants in the fully leased building include <span class="companylink">Time Warner</span>, Nautica, Tory Burch and Epsilon Interactive. The tenant moving out of LBi's new space is Mergermarket, a subsidiary of the Financial Times, which is consolidating and moving to 330 Hudson St. in SoHo.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marymount School Wins</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Upper East Side Site</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marymount School, an all-girls Catholic school that's been in New York more than 80 years, bought a vacant lot on the Upper East Side in the latest sign of growth among the city's private schools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The school closed last week on the $21 million purchase of a vacant lot at 115 E. 97th St., which is approved for a 110,000-square-foot building. Marymount currently leases a property directly across the street where it schools middle and upper school students.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Wolf from <span class="companylink">Denham Wolf Real Estate</span> said there was "tremendous demand" for this site from schools and health-care operations. It was placed on the market a year ago by the Sigety family, who also own three luxury rental buildings on Lexington Avenue between East 96th and East 98th streets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sigetys decided to go with Marymount School because "they are the right neighbors for them," says Mr. Wolf.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tim Sheehan, Senior Vice President in Brokerage Services for CBRE New York who represented Marymount, said it was a fair price for a property which was really one of the few remaining vacant sites in the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marymount School headmistress Concepcion Alvar said the school intends to build a "school of the future" on the site with athletic facilities, gymnasium, a performing arts center and science and technology labs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marymount doesn't plan to start construction immediately. Until it begins, the lot will be used as a playing field.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Creative Office Leasing</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not just Manhattan office building owners that have had to get more creative in their leasing because of the consolidation by the financial-services industry. Owners of buildings in secondary markets that have relied heavily on financial services also have had to cast a wider net to find tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider the <span class="companylink">LeFrak Organization</span>'s efforts to fill space leased by <span class="companylink">Charles Schwab Corp</span>. in 111 Town Square Place, one of eight buildings that make up the Newport Office Center on the Hudson River waterfront. The brokerage giant, which had 120,000 square feet, sublet much of it after the economic downturn hit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with the <span class="companylink">Charles Schwab</span> lease expiring in August, LeFrak executives also signed nine new leases to fill a 62,000-square-foot hole. Some of the new tenants are in the financial-services industry, like Hartfield Titus &amp; Donnelly, a municipal bond brokerage firm, which took 15,500 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many are in the transportation and media businesses. For example, Stagnito Media, a publisher of digital magazines and websites, took 7,300 square feet and West Legend Corp., a supplier to home improvement retailers and contractors took 3,200 square feet.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Neil Shah   </div><div>560 words</div><div>21 September 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>9</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A strengthened housing market is lifting property values and helping Americans repair their balance sheets, a trend that could spur the economy by making households more willing to spend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The value of Americans' real-estate holdings jumped about $400 billion, or 2.1%, to $19.1 trillion in the second quarter, the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> said Thursday, the highest level since the final three months of 2008. The increase follows a similar leap in the first quarter and raises the amount of equity that owners have in their homes to a high since the third quarter of 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the recession, sliding property prices have made Americans feel less wealthy and less willing to spend on everything from home renovations and appliances to restaurant meals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That weighs on the recovery because consumer spending fuels two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With real-estate values now rising -- and housing chalking up more gains recently in sales and construction -- Americans are seeing their critical assets rise in value as their disposable incomes also climb. That helps in rebuilding wealth and makes even heavier debts more manageable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising home values are "very helpful," said Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at <span class="companylink">UniCredit Bank</span>, who estimates that stabilizing home prices could boost America's gross domestic product in 2012 by more than half a percentage point. "I think the fundamentals for a stronger pickup in consumer spending are in place."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. households' net worth -- the value of homes, stocks and other investments minus debts and other liabilities -- dropped about $300 billion, or 0.5%, to $62.67 trillion from April through June, the first decline in three quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the drop was driven by financial assets like stocks, which lost about $600 billion in value as the Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 2.5% in the second quarter. During the third quarter, such investments have rebounded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">The Fed</span> report also showed that borrowing inched up, with household liabilities, mostly debt, rising 0.1% to $13.46 trillion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The salutary effect of housing-market gains on Americans' balance sheets could reduce the risk of recession, some economists said. Home prices rose 6.9% in the second quarter from three months earlier, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic Inc</span>. Last week, the data firm said that in the first half of 2012, rising prices lifted more than 1.3 million homeowners who owed more on their homes than they were worth above the water line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The ongoing climb by home prices can only enhance the economic outlook," <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics economist John Lonski wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Onno Koelman, a 32-year-old engineer, is among those feeling better about his personal finances and spending more. Mr. Koelman and his wife bought a $525,000 home in California's Marin County in the spring of 2010 and are refinancing their mortgage for the second time. Recent appraisals put their house between $550,000 and $560,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's definitely relaxing," said Mr. Koelman, who works for a company that serves the drinking-water industry. With their residence gaining value, the couple is spending money on home improvements rather than paying off hefty student debts. "Things are going to get better," Mr. Koelman said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos </div><div>943 words</div><div>20 September 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales and construction jumped to their highest levels in more than two years, offering the strongest signal to date that the U.S. housing sector has turned the corner after a six-year rout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing recovery has indeed started," said Michelle Meyer, an economist at <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span><span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family housing starts in August rose by 5.5% from July to their highest level in 28 months, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. In August, builders started construction on 535,000 homes at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, up 26.8% from one year ago. Overall housing starts were up by 2.3%, amid a small drop in the more volatile multifamily sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, sales of previously owned homes in August rose by 7.8% from July to their highest level in 27 months, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said. Sales climbed 9.3% from a year ago, marking the 14th straight year-over-year sales increase, even as the number of homes listed for sale was down sharply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stronger sales and construction should help the economy in two ways. Rising prices could help reassure would-be buyers that it is no longer foolish to buy a home. Higher levels of new-home construction, meanwhile, will create jobs. Home values were up in 91 of 177 markets from a year ago in August, according to real-estate company <span class="companylink">Zillow Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are still plenty of reasons for caution. Sales and construction levels are well below even their pre-bubble levels, and the year-over-year comparisons look better in part because 2011 was so weak. Other headwinds include a more rigorous mortgage-qualification process and the fact that many would-be buyers have either too much debt to qualify for a loan or too little home-equity to sell their current residence and buy another home. Foreclosures are also still high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Wednesday's home-sales report offered evidence that traditional owner-occupant buyers are returning in force, replacing investors that helped lead the charge earlier this year. Demand has been buoyed by mortgage rates that continue falling to their lowest recorded levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While job growth isn't as strong as most economists would like, even modest gains are lifting sales. "There are a lot of folks getting off the fence," said Dean Wehrli, a housing analyst based in Sacramento, Calif., with John Burns Real Estate Consulting. "They weren't underwater, they didn't lose their jobs in 2008, 2009, and 2010, and they just got sick of waiting."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales were strongest in the Midwest which reported a 17.9% year-over-year gain, and the South where the increase was 11.1%. They were flat compared with one year ago in the West, where many markets have seen sharp declines in listed inventory over the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kyle Friedrich looked into buying a house near Sacramento, Calif., during the past two summers, but didn't have a stable job until this year. "Once I got my job, I said, 'Let's go,'" said Mr. Friedrich, a 23-year-old engineer for a general contractor. He lost out on the first four homes where he made offers. Like many entry-level buyers, he faced competition from investors who can bypass a time-consuming mortgage-approval process by making all-cash offers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, Mr. Friedrich bid the full $210,000 asking price on a three-bedroom foreclosed home in Carmichael, Calif., that an investor had bought and spruced up. Two appraisals said the property was worth less than the agreed upon price, which nearly derailed the deal. The seller, who happened to be Mr. Friedrich's former youth baseball coach, agreed to drop the price to $189,000. Mr. Friedrich isn't worried about home prices falling further. "I bought what I could afford," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories are down from a year ago. That is in part because banks have sharply slowed their pace of foreclosures and in part because investors have converted more homes to rentals, taking them out of the for-sale pool. At the current pace of sales, it would take 6.1 months to sell the listed supply of homes, down from 8.2 months of supply a year ago. Real-estate agents generally consider a balanced market to have six months' supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising demand and shrinking supply are boosting the prospects of home builders, long sidelined by competition from a glut of foreclosed properties. "Frankly, there just isn't a lot for buyers to choose from in the re-sale sector right now," said Richard Lafferty, chief executive of Lafferty Communities, a small private builder in San Ramon, Calif. Mr. Lafferty said he is on track to sell 50 homes in Oakwood Shores, a development in Manteca, Calif., about an hour east of the San Francisco Bay this year. He purchased the development in 2009 from three banks that had taken over some 450 lots and 25 unfinished homes. During the market's peak, nearby homes sold for as much as $900,000. Today, Mr. Lafferty is selling homes in the mid-$400,000 range, and has sold 14 in the past three weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lack of attractive inventory is having "the single biggest impact on new-home sales right now," Mr. Wehrli said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than one-quarter of homes listed for sale in August had gone under contract after two weeks or less on the market, according to Redfin, a real-estate brokerage.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks edged up, helped by a rally in home builders' shares, after existing-home sales rose more than expected and Japan's <span class="companylink">central bank</span> moved to stimulate the country's economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 13.32 points, or 0.1%, to 13577.96. The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index added 1.73 points, or 0.1%, to 1461.05. The consumer-discretionary sector, which includes home builders, led Wednesday's gains while energy shares lagged behind. The <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> Composite Index rose 4.82 points, or 0.2%, to 3182.62.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are many reasons to feel good about housing, including data that we saw today," said Elizabeth Ptacek, real-estate analyst at Cleveland-based <span class="companylink">KeyBank</span>. "There's not much positive out there, and housing represents a bright spot."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously occupied homes in August climbed more than expected from a month earlier, according to a <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> report. While August housing starts rose less than economists had expected in August, construction of single-family homes rose to the highest level in more than two years, the Commerce Department said. New starts on apartment building saw a decline, but new building permits fell less than economists had projected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders rallied, with <span class="companylink">PulteGroup</span> adding 67 cents, or 4.3%, to $16.43, and <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span> rising 87 cents, or 4.1%, to 22.22. Home-goods retailer <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> rose 61 cents, or 1%, to 59.47, the second-biggest advance among the 30 Dow components.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also bolstering stocks, the Bank of Japan expanded a bond-buying program meant to stimulate its economy. The move followed similar efforts by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> last week and the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> a week earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asian markets climbed, with Japan's <span class="companylink">Nikkei</span> Stock Average rising 1.2% to close at a 4 1/2-month high and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index also advancing 1.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European markets edged mostly higher, with the Stoxx Europe 600 up 0.4%, its first gain in three days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crude-oil prices lost 3.5%, to settle at $91.98 a barrel, while gold prices rose 0.03%, to settle at $1,769 a troy ounce. The dollar fell against the euro and yen. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.782%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In corporate news, <span class="companylink">Groupon</span> jumped 65 cents, or 14%, to 5.34, after announcing a new payment service that allows merchants to accept credit and debit cards by swiping them through a card reader attached to an iPhone or iPod touch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Tyco International</span> briefly saw its stock jerk to session highs after midmorning trades that <span class="companylink">Nasdaq OMX Group</span> later canceled. <span class="companylink">Tyco</span> shares ended up 76 cents, or 1.4%, at 55.16. The unusual activity followed brief price spikes Tuesday afternoon in seven oil-related stocks that led to reviews by exchanges and confusion on trading desks. Tuesday's swings were caused by a trader accidentally entering the wrong size for an order to trade a basket of stocks, according to a person familiar with the matter. The exchanges on Tuesday said the trades would stand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Questcor Pharmaceuticals</span> plunged 24.17, or 48%, to 26.35, after <span class="companylink">Aetna</span> limited reimbursement for the pharmaceutical drug maker's primary product, which treats infantile spasms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Facebook</span> jumped 1.42, or 6.5%, to 23.29, the second-biggest daily increase since its May initial public offering. The advanced trimmed the shares' loss the last three months to 27%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HENDERSON, Nev. -- The latest sign that the housing market is bubbling to life: The artificial waterfall at the entryway to Lake Las Vegas is again flowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few developments were hit harder in the real-estate crash than this mixed-use project in the desert 20 miles southeast of Las Vegas. Anchored by a 320-acre man-made lake, it counts singer Celine Dion among the well-heeled owners, but saw home values plunge, sales stall and foreclosures rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The development's casino and a <span class="companylink">Ritz-Carlton</span> hotel closed in 2010, and the company that owned much of the undeveloped land filed for bankruptcy protection. The waterfall remained dry, much to the chagrin of buyers of the project's roughly 1,700 homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today foreclosures are down, the casino and hotel have new operators and freshly-built and existing homes are selling, albeit at much lower prices. Hedge-fund manager John Paulson's Real Estate Private Equity Group recently snapped up 530 acres of developable land in Lake Las Vegas for $17 million in cash from lenders including <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>, for four cents on the dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The signs of a recovery in Lake Las Vegas show that the housing-market improvements that first appeared this year in many city centers and core neighborhoods are beginning to be seen in outlying areas. They also indicate that some of the hardest-hit spots have gone through a purging process and seen prices reset at market levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Two years ago, no one would have touched anything to do with Lake Las Vegas," says Andrew Stegen, general manager of Ravella, the hotel that filled the <span class="companylink">Ritz-Carlton</span>'s shell in early 2011. The Paulson purchase "is a huge boost of confidence."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Paulson firm made billions by betting against the housing market during the boom years. It has been bullish on the broader market's long-term prospects since first investing in land at the end of 2009, says Michael Barr, a Paulson portfolio manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, no one is calling the Lake Las Vegas development booming. Two of the three golf courses, designed by golf legends Jack Nicklaus and Tom Weiskopf, are closed and their brown grass has been an eyesore and a turnoff to some potential buyers, local real-estate agents and builders say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, Lake Las Vegas home values have tumbled dramatically from their peak and have barely improved since they hit bottom, according to real-estate website <span class="companylink">Zillow Inc</span>. In a recent deal, a three-bedroom, three-bath home sold for $540,000, down from the $1 million it would have gone for at the 2006 peak says Robyn Yates, owner of Windermere Prestige Properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, just 24 foreclosure notices were filed in July, an 80% plunge from a year ago, according to RealtyTrac. Indeed, during a visit earlier this summer, business was brisk at a Ravella hotel bar which has Tuscan-inspired views of manicured hedges surrounding a fire pit, with customers sipping martinis and noshing on pappardelle with veal meatballs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's fun watching the area come back to life," says Berny Dohrmann, chairman of CEO Space International, a networking group for small-business owners that began holding conferences at Lake Las Vegas in 2009. Back then, numerous shops were closed and the area seemed like a "dying Western ghost town," Mr. Dohrmann says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly four years ago, Mike Howard and a partner purchased a foreclosed three-bedroom home in a gated section of Lake Las Vegas. Back then, the area seemed depressed and there were rumors the lake would dry up, recalls the 71-year-old retired chemistry teacher and athletic coach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, he's optimistic about the area's future. "We're not seeing prices jumping, but we feel comfortable that we've hit bottom," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lake Las Vegas was developed by a group including Texas billionaire brothers Sid and Lee Bass and the late developer Ron Boeddeker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While overbuilding caused Las Vegas to collapse during the housing crash, Lake Las Vegas was hit even harder. At the height of the city's foreclosure crisis, one in every 45 homes received a foreclosure filing, compared with one in every 13 in Lake Las Vegas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, the developers defaulted on a $540 million loan arranged by <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project spent about two years in bankruptcy before emerging in the summer of 2010, with most of it going back to creditors. <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>, which declined to comment, now owns the former <span class="companylink">Ritz-Carlton</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 50 homes changed hands in the second quarter, up from 43 in the first quarter. New tenants include a coffee shop, two restaurants and a photography studio, says broker Julie A. Barbagallo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Ravella, which is operated by Dolce Hotels and Resorts, second-quarter occupancy climbed 13% from a year ago, while revenue per available room, a key revenue measure for hotels, increased 40% and the hotel is close to being profitable, according to Mr. Stegen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, the closed courses are the biggest reminder of the area's turmoil. Robb Beville, president of builder Harmony Homes, would like to see them reopen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Beville has sold 13 homes his year, down from 14 last year, but he thinks sales would be higher if the courses were open and home buyers could enjoy views of lush greens and fairways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lake Las Vegas "still has its challenges," he says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of previously occupied homes and construction of single-family homes last month reached the highest level in more than two years as the turnaround of the long-troubled sector provides a boost to the tepid economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales increased 7.8% in August from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.82 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Wednesday. The month's sales were 9.3% above the same month a year earlier and are the highest since May 2010 when first-time homebuyers were rushing to qualify for a tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, housing starts increased 2.3% last month from July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 750,000, according to a separate Commerce Department report Wednesday. Single-family home construction, which made up 71% of housing starts last month, was up to its highest levels since April 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The U.S. housing recovery is for real," said Sal Guatieri, senior economist with BMO Capital Markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price for previously owned homes in August was $187,400, up 9.5% from the same month a year earlier. The trend reflects a combination in the mix of homes, with more normal transactions beginning to occur and fewer distressed property sales, said Realtors' chief economist, Lawrence Yun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is a surprisingly strong report," said Millan Mulraine, an economist with <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span>. "The report reinforces our belief that the pieces for a more sustainable housing sector recovery are now falling into place."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department data showed single-family construction reached the highest level in more than two years, confirming that the sector is helping the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there are plenty of reasons for caution: Sales and construction starts are still below even their pre-bubble levels, and the year-over-year comparisons look strong because last year was terrible. Tax credits fueled a burst of sales activity in late 2009 and early 2010, and the hangover hit housing markets hard in much of 2011.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Positive signs from the housing market and action from Japan's <span class="companylink">central bank</span> put U.S. stocks on track to post their sixth gain in the past seven trading days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 46 points, or 0.4%, to 13611, in early-afternoon trading Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index added three points, or 0.2%, to 1463. Consumer-discretionary and materials shares advanced, while the energy sector lagged behind. The Nasdaq Composite Index gained two points, or 0.1%, to 3180.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are many reasons to feel good about housing, including the data that we saw today," said Elizabeth Ptacek, real-estate analyst at Cleveland-based <span class="companylink">KeyBank</span>. "There's not much positive out there and housing represents a bright spot."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously occupied homes in August climbed more than expected from a month earlier, according to a <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> report. While August housing starts rose less than economists had expected in August, construction of single-family homes rose to the highest level in more than two years, the Commerce Department said. New starts on apartment buildings saw a decline, but new building permits fell less than economists had projected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Bank of Japan</span> increased the size of its asset-purchase program to 80 trillion yen ($1.01 trillion) from 70 trillion yen and extended the deadline of the program by six months to the end of 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The U.S. is in a slow and low-growth mode, but if we get some of the headwind lifted from Asia and Europe, then we're talking about an acceleration of the economy," said Diane Jaffee, senior portfolio manager at <span class="companylink">TCW Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gold rose 0.1%, to $1,772.50 a troy ounce. The dollar fell against the euro and yen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In corporate news, <span class="companylink">Cracker Barrel Old Country Store</span> climbed 6.9% after reporting better-than-expected earnings and sales for the latest quarter and raising its dividend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">General Mills</span> gained 2.2% after reporting fiscal first-quarter earnings that exceeded expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corning added 2.4% after <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> analysts raised their rating on the shares to "buy," citing the company's efforts to diversify its business into other areas such as fiber-optic cable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European Stocks</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Stoxx Europe 600 index rose 0.4% to 274.90, snapping a two-day losing streak, largely drawing on the same catalysts as in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">London's FTSE 100 index gained 0.4% to 5888.48, supported by bank shares. Germany's DAX 30 index rose 0.6% to 7390.76 and France's CAC 40 index gained 0.5% to 3531.82.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have had a good run-up in equities and we're in a waiting position from here," said Peter Garnry, equity strategist at <span class="companylink">Saxo Bank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among individual stocks, Heineken posted one of the biggest gains in the pan-European index, rallying 6.4%. The Dutch brewer got closer to securing a deal to gain control of <span class="companylink">Asia Pacific Breweries</span> and its Tiger beer brand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In London, <span class="companylink">HSBC Holdings</span> and <span class="companylink">Lloyds Banking Group</span> both added 1.7%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro turned back up against the dollar on Wednesday after a pair of reports on the U.S. housing sector showed some improvement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar had been up earlier as the Bank of Japan's expanded asset-purchase program showed more central banks than just the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> are injecting further stimulus into the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the greenback gave up gains after the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said existing home sales rose at a faster rate in August than analysts expected. An earlier report showed housing starts last month rose less than expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At midday in New York, the euro climbed to $1.3068 from $1.3048 late Tuesday. The dollar traded at 78.42 yen from 78.82 yen, while the euro was at 102.49 yen versus 102.80 yen. The pound bought $1.6214 from $1.6245; the dollar fetched 0.9269 Swiss franc from 0.9285 franc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During European hours, the euro declined as German officials reportedly sought to water down proposals for a European banking union and a supervisory role for the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Proposals for a strong banking union are seen by some "as a critical foundation for a sound currency," said Boris Schlossberg, managing director at BK Asset Management. "Therefore, any proposals to diminish the ECB's supervisory authority is viewed very negatively by the market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The yen mostly dropped after the <span class="companylink">Bank of Japan</span> moved to further ease monetary policy by expanding its own asset-purchase program -- a move many didn't expect so soon. The <span class="companylink">central bank</span>'s move bolstered global equities, undercutting demand for such haven currencies as Japan's yen and the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bank of Japan's decision comes less than a week after the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> announced it would embark on a third round of quantitative easing to underpin the U.S. recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Investors had been aware of the possibility of such a move but it had not been fully priced into the market. Consequently, the yen took a hit when the BOJ made its announcement," noted strategists at Moneycorp in London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move helped revive a risk rally that had been fueled in part by last week's Fed move and the ECB's announcement earlier this month of a bond-buying plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The WSJ dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a slightly larger basket, slipped to 69.18 from 69.30.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Telis Demos and A.D. Pruitt </div><div>886 words</div><div>19 September 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market for initial public offerings by real-estate companies has been grim this year, but that might be about to change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some companies are moving to capitalize on the hottest real-estate sectors, as well as the early signs that the housing market, at long last, may be poised for a rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, Spirit Realty Finance Inc., a company that leases property to retail chains like <span class="companylink">Shopko Stores</span>, AMC Theatres and Applebee's, hopes to raise as much as $487 million in an IPO. It would be the largest IPO of a real-estate investment trust, or REIT, since May 2011, according to Dealogic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The parent of <span class="companylink">Realogy Corp</span>., which owns Century 21, Coldwell Banker and other leading residential brands, wants to raise as much as $1 billion in an IPO and could launch its deal over the next few weeks, according to people familiar with its plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, in what would be one of the largest real-estate IPOs, <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc</span>. has filed with regulators to take apartment giant Archstone public. Apartment buildings have been one of the hottest property types in the past two years thanks to strong demand for rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These deals would be an encouraging sign for the real-estate equity capital markets and also a sign that real-estate fundamentals continue to improve," said Jay Leupp, a realty income portfolio manager at <span class="companylink">Lazard Asset Management LLC</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weakness of the real-estate IPO market has put a damper on plans by a wide range of companies. Dozens of privately held real-estate companies and REITs that aren't traded have been longing for a stronger IPO market as an exit strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of REITs, which pay at least 90% of their income in dividends, have had a strong year along with the rest of the stock market. But 2012 has been one of the slowest years in the past decade for REIT public offerings, with only 2008 seeing fewer, according to Dealogic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reason: Wall Street has been concerned that the new REITs won't be able to maintain earnings growth because of the weak economy. As a result, investors have demanded discounts to asset value from the untested companies that they haven't been willing to give, according to Mr. Leupp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Investors are certainly hungry for yield, but yield that is safe from inflation through earnings growth," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now, improving prices and sales volumes in some real-estate markets, plus continued efforts to keep borrowing rates low by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>, are leading companies seeking IPOs and their bankers to pitch the companies as early bets on a coming turnaround.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There also has been a strong demand for REITs by fund managers. Real-estate-focused equity funds saw the largest increase of any fund category in July, with $800 million in new assets, according to the most recent data from Lipper, which tracks fund flows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spirit is aiming to be in a position to grow by deleveraging and adding new retail properties, according to the company's prospectus. The company generates most of its revenue by leasing properties to retail chains and fast food restaurants. About 30% of its lease income comes from <span class="companylink">Shopko Stores</span>, a discount general merchandise chain outside of Green Bay, Wisc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joel Beam, fund manager of the Forward Select Income Fund, estimates that Spirit would yield 7.4% at the midpoint of its expected IPO price range, an attractive return in the current low interest-rate environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other companies believe they can build a strong growth story on the turnaround of the home-sales market. <span class="companylink">Realogy</span>'s parent, <span class="companylink">Domus Holdings</span>, for example, may be very close to launching its $1 billion IPO, according to people familiar with its deal. The IPO is likely to launch before November, these people said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for Domus declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Realogy</span> was bought by private-equity firm Apollo in 2007 for $8.5 billion. The value of <span class="companylink">Realogy</span> declined sharply during the downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Potentially the largest new listing would be Archstone, which has filed with regulators to go public as a REIT. It owns more than 400 apartment complexes in the U.S. and Europe, primarily around major cities. The company filed initial plans to raise just $100 million, but it may ultimately seek to raise as much as $2 billion to $3 billion in an IPO, people familiar with its plans said. A Kehman spokeswoman declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Archstone and Lehman are hoping an IPO would catch the crest of the wave in the rental-apartment market that has pushed values of prime property in the hot regions to record highs. Archstone, if it went forward with the IPO, also would likely see demand because it is one of the largest and most established players in the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Archstone is an enormous portfolio of institutional grade apartment buildings being managed by somebody that's already successful in the REIT space," said Jeung Hyun, a fund manager at <span class="companylink">Adelante Capital Management</span>.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Hotel Construction Picks Up --- Increase in Occupancy and Room Rates Fuels Rebound; Lenders More Willing</span>
</div><div class="author">By Kris Hudson </div><div>932 words</div><div>19 September 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C12</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hotel construction, which dropped sharply during the economic downturn, has staged a modest turnaround, buoyed by building booms in New York as well as in small towns crowded with workers drilling oil-shale formations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past four quarters, construction starts for U.S. hotels are up 32% by room count from the same period a year ago, and new-project announcements are up 22%, according to Lodging Econometrics, which tracks the hotel industry globally. Fueling the construction rebound are rising occupancy and room rates at U.S. hotels since 2009 and a willingness by more lenders to make hotel-construction loans, typically the most volatile and risky of commercial real-estate classes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average U.S. room rate of $105.53 in the first seven months of this year marks a 6.6% increase from the same period in 2009, according to <span class="companylink">Smith Travel Research</span>. Average occupancy increased in the same span by nearly seven percentage points to 62.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pickup in hotel construction is a mixed signal for the industry. Although it is viewed as a sign that developers are confident about the economy's prospects and about consumers' willingness to travel, some owners of existing hotels worry that too many new hotels can lead to lower room rates in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But so far, analysts say the new construction cycle isn't likely to lead to an oversupply of rooms, coming after nearly three years of declines in construction. At the end of the second quarter, developers had 474 hotels, totaling 60,000 rooms, under construction in the U.S. That is up from 437 hotels and nearly 55,000 rooms in the previous year. New-project announcements in the past year totaled 1,180 hotels, up from 926 announced in the previous year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Very modestly and very quietly, a new [construction] cycle has begun," said Patrick Ford, president of Lodging Econometrics. The company predicts a steady rise in new hotel openings through 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York remains by far the most-active market for hotel construction with 7,248 rooms being built, amounting to roughly 11% of the national total. Though the city's room count grew 7% in 2010 and 2.3% last year, its occupancy has remained above 80% since 2010. "New development is not catching up with the increase in demand," said Issac Hera, chief executive of Brack Capital Real Estate USA, which is developing three hotels in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A similar hotel boom is unfolding in a far different locale: rural communities atop oil-shale formations being drilled for oil and natural gas. Of the top 10 U.S. markets for hotel construction in the past year, three are in oil-shale areas: North Dakota, with 2,088 rooms under construction; the greater Corpus Christi area in Texas, with 1,491 rooms; and rural Oklahoma, with 1,242 rooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most developers in these smaller markets are building budget and midscale hotels to accommodate oil-shale workers and other energy-industry employee. The hotels are needed in these areas to house the many workers, from engineers to rig workers, needed to drill and complete wells across the region. Since those workforces move around often to different drill sites, companies prefer to house them in hotels rather than longer-term residences such as houses or apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Braxton Development, based in Bozeman, Mont., built Microtel Inns in the small North Dakota towns of Williston and Dickinson last year and opened a Hampton Inn in Williston last August. "When we first started, we were the second hotel in Williston to get built," Braxton principal Jon Braxton said. "But more competition came along quickly. It's as crazy as ever. Hotels still are running fairly full."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, some hoteliers worry that the hotel-construction booms in markets like North Dakota amount to a bubble set to pop, especially if federal regulation cools the drilling industry or if gas and oil prices decline sharply. Lamont Cos., based in Aberdeen, S.D., recently built a Hampton Inn in Dickinson, N.D., and the builder also is planning a Candlewood Suites in the town. Yet Jeff Lamont, president and chief executive, said he would sell the properties if the right offer surfaces. "I know of six or seven hotels going up in Dickinson," he said. "It has us a little nervous about what might happen with the occupancy once all of these hotels are built. To me, it seems like there might not be enough demand there for all of them."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, two-thirds of new hotels under construction in the U.S. are either upscale or upper-midscale, according to Lodging Econometrics. Those categories include brands such as Hilton Garden Inn, Courtyard by Marriott and Holiday Inn. And many of those are limited-service properties, meaning they don't include restaurants, spas or other amenities found in full-service hotels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The construction boom is made possible by the availability of construction loans, which dried up during the economic downturn but are now starting to flow again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joe Hoesley, vice president of commercial real estate for <span class="companylink">U.S. Bancorp</span> in Minneapolis, said underwriting criteria remains fairly stringent for hotel developments. Most banks refuse to issue loans covering more than 50% to 60% of a project's cost, and interest rates on those loans still are higher than loans to build offices or apartments, he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With two days remaining in the month, the blue-chip Dow has added 0.8% so far in August, while the S&amp;P 500 has tacked on 2.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leading the day's gains were telecommunications and consumer discretionary stocks. <span class="companylink">Verizon Communications</span> led the Dow components, while energy and utilities shares weighed. <span class="companylink">Coca-Cola</span> was the biggest decliner on the Dow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The modest gains came after a pair of readings on the U.S. economy came in better than expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A revision to U.S. gross domestic product in the second quarter showed growth at 1.7% from the previous quarter, higher than an original reading of 1.5% and in-line with economists' expectations. The stronger reading reflects higher consumer spending and fewer imports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, pending home sales for July increased 2.4% in July after declining 1.4% in June. The rise exceeded the 1% gain expected by analysts and pushed the number of pending home sales to the highest since April 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> also released its "beige book" report on economic conditions around the country, which saw modest and moderate growth across the U.S. Most districts saw steady or "slightly" growing employment. That report jibed with expectations that the Fed could soon act to boost the economy, with more clarity to come as soon as Friday, when Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke speaks at a meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's clear to me that while the stimulus program may not have as much of an economic impact, the anticipation for what these programs might be is significant... Every time Bernanke has hinted, the market has a positive reaction," says Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer of equities at <span class="companylink">Charles Schwab Investment Management</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, after a summer rally driven by what Mr. Aguilar believes are broad expectations for more easing, "the expectations are so high relative to what's happening that we're probably set for a disappointment," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European markets pared early losses to finish the day down slightly, as comments from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi boosted hopes that the ECB will act to stabilize the borrowing costs of the euro-zone's frail economies. The Stoxx Europe 600 ended the day down 0.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asian markets were mixed. The Shanghai Composite fell 1% to close at a fresh 3½-year low, and Japan's <span class="companylink">Nikkei</span> Stock Average rose 0.4%. China's <span class="companylink">Xinhua News Agency</span> reported that China's top economic planner said a rebound in housing prices would need to be prevented to curb speculative demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crude-oil futures fell 0.9% to $95.49 a barrel after the <span class="companylink">Group of Seven</span> leading industrialized economies called for a lift in oil production in the face of fears about Hurricane Isaac and tensions in Iran. Gold futures slipped 0.4% to $1,659.80 an ounce. The dollar fell against the euro but rose slightly against the yen. Demand for Treasurys fell, pushing the yield on the 10-year note higher to 1.652%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In corporate news, shares of <span class="companylink">H.J. Heinz</span> fell after the ketchup maker reported better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter earnings but its revenue fell short of forecasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yelp jumped even as 52.7 million shares became available for sale, marking the end of a 180-day lockup period on stock sales by company insiders following the online review site's initial public offering. That is an unusual move for the end of a lockup period, but its shares had plunged 31% over the previous three weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">WellPoint</span> climbed after the health insurer said Chief Executive Angela Braly resigned Tuesday. The company appointed its general counsel, John Cannon, as interim CEO while it searches for a permanent successor. A disappointing second-quarter earnings report had sharpened concerns about the company's strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jos. A. Bank Clothiers surged after the men's apparel retailer reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, citing strength in direct-marketing sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zale gained after the jewelry retailer reported a narrower-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter loss and said it expected to return to profitability in the current fiscal year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TORONTO--The Canadian dollar ended trading flat against the U.S. dollar for the third-straight session Wednesday, but underperformed most of its other major currency peers in the aftermath of the Bank of Japan's surprise announcement that it would expand its asset purchase program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. dollar was recently at C$0.9748, unchanged from 8:00 a.m. EDT Wednesday and C$0.9742 late Tuesday, according to data provider CQG. The U.S. dollar moved as low as C$0.9724 during overnight trading, but later retraced its losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian dollar underperformed most of its G10 currency peers against the U.S. dollar, with the euro, Australian dollar and Swiss franc outperforming after a pair of reports on the U.S. housing sector showed signs of a slow recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Japanese yen quickly erased losses made during the overnight trading as investors unwound long positions held in favor of the Canadian dollar and U.S. dollar after the Bank of Japan made the surprise announcement it would add Y10 trillion to its asset purchasing program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. housing starts rose 2.3% in August, slightly under expectations but still moving to its highest level in two years, while existing home sales increased by 7.8% last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Canadian housing prices increased by 0.2% in August from July, the smallest increase for the month of August in 12 years, according to the Teranet-National Bank National Composite House Price Index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The positive U.S. data should ultimately bode well for the Canadian economy, keeping the Canadian dollar "in check," said Firas Askari, head of foreign exchange at <span class="companylink">BMO</span> Capital Markets in Toronto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There has seem to be some signs of traction in the U.S. housing market, which has been very good for Canadian manufacturers," Mr. Askari said. "Their houses are built in the U.S. but a lot of their raw materials come from over here."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traders continue to expect the Canadian dollar to trade within current ranges for the rest of the week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only major domestic data release is consumer price index figures on Friday and even that doesn't appear likely to do much to influence the loonie, said Dave Bradley, director of foreign exchange at Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets in Toronto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Canadian dollar hasn't reacted that much to previous releases," he said. "At the end of the day, it's been doing its own thing."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK—The dollar fell against the yen after the <span class="companylink">Bank of Japan</span> expanded its monetary easing program to stimulate the local economy and weaken the yen's persistent appreciation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Japan's <span class="companylink">central bank</span> announced it would increase the size of its asset-purchase program to ¥80 trillion ($1.01 trillion) from ¥70 trillion and extend the program's deadline until the end of December 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar strengthened against the yen in an initial knee-jerk reaction as monetary easing generally weakens the local currency. However, the yen climbed in the New York session as traders realized the program "wasn't all that impressive in terms of what the BOJ actually delivered," said Ron Leven, currency strategist at <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late-afternoon trade, the dollar fell to ¥78.38 from ¥78.82 late Tuesday. It had risen as high as ¥79.23 earlier in the session. The euro also dropped against the yen to ¥102.28 from ¥102.81.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> and <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> both launched similar programs earlier this month. Last week, the Fed announced open-ended buying of mortgage-backed securities to jump-start the U.S. economy while the ECB pledged on Sept. 6 to buy bonds of struggling euro-zone countries if they requested aid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In the wake of the bold initiatives from the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> and <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span>, what the <span class="companylink">Bank of Japan</span> is proposing seems pretty modest," Mr. Leven said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another force supporting the Japanese currency was yen-buying from Japanese firms as they looked to hedge their balance sheets ahead of the third-quarter's end on Sept. 30, said Greg Anderson, a currency strategist at <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> in New York. The yen's decline after the initial BOJ statement gave corporations a cheaper entry into the yen, "close enough to their budget level that they didn't want to let it get past them," Mr. Anderson added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the euro rose against the dollar after better-than-expected U.S. housing data pointed to a more sustained upturn in the struggling U.S. housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes rose 7.8% in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.82 million, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. Economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires had expected a 2% rise to 4.56 million. U.S. housing starts also increased 2.3% in August, as single-family home construction jumped to its highest level since April 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro recently traded at $1.3060, up from $1.3048 late Tuesday. The pound bought $1.6214 compared with $1.6245, and the dollar fetched 0.9275 Swiss franc from 0.9285 franc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Australian dollar led the rally in currencies whose economies are closely tied to commodities. The Aussie rose to $1.0482 from $1.0456.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wall Street Journal Dollar Index, which measures the dollar against a basket of currencies, fell to 69.13 from 69.30 late Tuesday.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Simon Zekaria   </div><div>812 words</div><div>17 September 2012</div><div>14:27</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON—The American chief executive of <span class="companylink">Electrolux AB</span> Monday said a recovering U.S. housing market will prove a boon to home appliance makers, even as the Swedish giant warned near-term demand for fridges, cookers and washing machines across the developed world continues to suffer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview, Keith McLoughlin also said the world's second-largest white goods maker after Benton Harbor, Mich.-based <span class="companylink">Whirlpool Corp</span>. remains keen to buy bankrupt South Korean peer <span class="companylink">Daewoo Electronics</span> as it pushes growth into the emerging markets, even though the company hasn't been made the preferred bidder in the sale process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, the U.S. Federal Reserve moved to breathe new life into the housing market by buying mortgage-backed securities, but visibility on signs of life in the industry remain clouded amid tight credit and depressed new mortgage applications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. McLoughlin is upbeat. "It is not a question of if the housing market is coming back, it's when—2013, 2014 or 2015. Once unemployment goes from 8.3% to 6% and the corresponding consumer confidence gets back up we think the housing market pops back. There is some pent up demand there."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, for now the Stockholm-based company's first non-Swedish chief executive—Mr. McLoughlin is from Brooklyn, New York—warned demand across its debt-laden core markets of North America and Europe, where it generates the lion share of its sales, remains sluggish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think until Western Europe, North America and other mature markets do their necessary rebalancing and deleveraging, and consumer confidence [rises] again [to lift] discretionary purchases, I don't think the market recovers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Electrolux</span> forecasts flat to 2% volume growth in the U.S. this fiscal year, with a boost coming from pricing gains. Mr. McLoughlin thinks U.S. volume growth is more likely to come in at the bottom end of the forecast. At best the company expects a 2% decline in volumes in Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The total market in Western Europe is declining for consumer, discretionary, durable goods—Southern Europe is spreading to Central Europe, spreading to Northern Europe and even spreading a bit to Eastern Europe."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think in the near term demand is getting worse as the contagion spreads, but given the actions being taken both in Europe and outside Europe we're optimistic that this will be cycle that will recover," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group targets growing middle-class affluence in Latin America and Asia to offset declining appetite for its vacuum cleaners and dish washers in mature markets. It aims to generate half its revenue in emerging markets by 2017, up from 35% today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We think we are very much on track. If we did no more acquisitions and just kept the historical growth rate of mature markets versus emerging markets, we would hit the 50%. We are [also] comprehending additional bolt on acquisitions."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of those is <span class="companylink">Daewoo</span>, even as national conglomerate Dongbu Group is reportedly in pole position with a bid over $300 million. "<span class="companylink">Daewoo</span> has been for sale six different times. My advisers say this one isn't over until it goes to closing," said Mr. McLoughlin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A positive outlook means the company is in a "growth phase", said Mr. McLoughlin, noting a considerable contribution from deal making activity. <span class="companylink">Electrolux</span> last year made two buys to boost its emerging markets operations as it took hold of Egypt's Olympic Group and Chilean appliance company CTI.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Of the 13% top line growth in the first half, six was acquired and six was organic. One was currency. We are keeping our eyes open."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McLoughlin said China, one of the biggest opportunities for the world's biggest appliance manufacturers, has seen a slowdown, but the size of the population will trump slack demand amid concerns over real estate over-construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Has there been an over build and infrastructure over the last several years? It looks like to us there has been. Can that be relatively quickly absorbed with a market, economy and population demographic that large? We think it can. We think China like any other economy will go through cycles."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company is also benefiting from more benign commodity prices, with steel prices falling as a result of weaker demand. But Mr. McLoughlin preaches caution given the company's wide materials exposure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The big trend in steel, which is our largest individual buy, is certainly positive. [But] it's going to be mitigated a little bit on certain plastics and resins. That is going up."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So while the company locks in 50% to 70% of its steel prices on annual hedging contracts, it takes a rolling three-month approach to plastics to respond quickly to market demand.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Housing on Mend, but Full Recovery Is Far Off</span>
</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos </div><div>1028 words</div><div>14 September 2012</div><div>16:58</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices during the first half of 2012 posted their strongest gains in six years, the clearest sign that more U.S. housing markets have hit bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the housing market remains far from normal. Hitting a bottom shouldn't be confused with a full-on recovery, which looks a ways off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's rising prices have less to do with surging demand—though hard-hit markets in Arizona, California, and Florida have seen significant investor appetite for distressed homes—than with declines in the number of properties for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories of "existing" homes—that is, ones that haven't just been built—are at eight-year lows. New-home inventories are lower than at any time since the U.S. census began tracking them in 1963. In some cities, there are one-third fewer homes listed for sale than a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's why prices are rising: There are more buyers chasing fewer homes, and—critically—fewer distressed homes, such as foreclosures. Low inventory is one sign that housing markets may have reached a turning point because many want to buy at the bottom but few want to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are several factors behind the low inventory. Banks have slowed their pace of foreclosures. Investors have snapped up discounted properties that they can convert into rentals. Home builders, struggling for several years to compete on price with foreclosed properties, have added little in the way of new supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, price gains are concentrated at the low end of the market, where inventory declines have been most dramatic. "The market is really drying up in these seemingly distressed markets really quickly," said Michael Sklarz, president of research firm Collateral Analytics. "They really are scratching for properties to sell."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low inventory is benefiting home builders, as buyers grow frustrated by bidding wars sparked by a shortage of move-in-ready housing. "People can't find inventory that they want, so they say, 'I'm just going to buy the house down the block that's brand new. I don't have to go through the whole torture,' " Mr. Sklarz said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing's progress is good news for the economy. Residential investment has now contributed to U.S. economic output for the past five quarters, which hasn't happened since 2005. In other words, housing is no longer a drag, though it is packing far less of a punch than it normally does at this point in the economic cycle. Rising prices also could help turn around consumers' fragile psychology, an unpredictable but important factor that can fuel more sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But low inventory isn't necessarily a sign of strength. One problem is that many sellers can't or won't become buyers. Millions still owe more than their homes are worth, and even more—about 45% of all homeowners with a mortgage, according to data firm <span class="companylink">CoreLogic Inc</span>.—have less than 20% in equity. That means they don't have enough money to make a large down payment and pay their real-estate agent's commission to buy a comparable house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Large price declines have left cities without what historically has been the most active segment of the home-buying market: families looking to trade up and retirees seeking to downsize. That leaves many markets relying on investors and first-time buyers, who are most sensitive to rising prices and mortgage rates. Ironically, prices are rising fastest in markets that have the most underwater borrowers because so few homes are for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While low inventories have helped firm up prices, they could also soon lead to year-over-year declines in sales volumes because there aren't enough homes on the market to sustain the current sales pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider Phoenix. Home prices through June were up by 17% over the past year, the best increase among the nation's big cities. But home sales in July fell 8% from a year ago, amid a drop in supply of more than 25%, according to a report from Mike Orr of <span class="companylink">Arizona State University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jon Mirmelli, a local real-estate investor, said, "Buyers aren't happy with what they see, and they're staying on the sidelines."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are other reasons for caution. Banks are still stingy with credit. Many would-be buyers have too much debt to qualify for a mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A large overhang of distressed mortgages ultimately could drive more homeowners to sell or push banks to accelerate foreclosures. This "shadow inventory" looks as if it won't be dumped on the market in a way that would trigger deep price declines, but it would probably keep a lid on any swift gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jobs and wages also aren't growing fast enough to sustain big rises in home prices. Recent gains may be less indicative of a strong recovery and instead point to how prices in some markets "overcorrected," bringing in investors who will step back as prices firm up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others worry that mortgage rates, which are down by a full percentage point from one year ago, are temporarily boosting sales and that housing demand will slump once rates rise. Compared with a year ago, mortgage rates allow borrowers to take out about 12% more in debt without increasing their monthly payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The changing debate over housing underscores the sector's tentative progress. Earlier this year, the question was whether housing would hit bottom this year or next. Now, it is "about how strong any recovery will be, how long it will last, and whether it will reach every neighborhood in America," said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of Redfin, a real-estate brokerage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An important test comes later this year. In each of the past three years, prices rose in the summer but gave up all those gains and more in the winter, when sales traditionally slow. This year could be different because the supply of homes isn't piling up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Absent a shock to the economy, housing is on the mend. But it will be a long time before it returns to normal.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anita Likus  </div><div>851 words</div><div>12 September 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Europe Edition)</div><div>WSJE</div><div>24</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A mismatch between the kind of property that investors are seeking and what is available to buy is likely to push European real-estate prices lower for all but premium assets, according to real-estate analysts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, the supply of property coming to market exceeds demand. European property valued at 413 billion euros ($526.9 billion) is going to come to the market over the next five years, averaging 83 billion euros a year, said Harm Meijer, European property analyst at <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, just 126 billion euros of equity is available for purchases, with most buyers "targeting the type of assets that aren't up for sale," said Mr. Meijer. The investment of that equity is expected to be spread over a number of years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two biggest sellers of property will be banks, which continue to cut exposure to real estate, and governments on austerity drives, according to <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span>. Banks are expected to sell 231 billion euros in the next five years, while European governments should sell 117 billion euros of assets, <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, sales activity in Europe is far from the peak in 2006, when property valued at 246 billion euros was sold. In 2011, the total was 119 billion euros, according to figures from property adviser <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the properties being offered aren't the type most sought after by investors. For example, though European governments have some iconic properties in their portfolios, the buildings are either historic and need upgrades to bring them to modern standards, which makes them difficult targets for investors, or rundown and empty, which drives prices down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This means the pricing gap between prime assets -- those of high quality in top locations -- and secondary assets will grow, Mr. Meijer said. "Prime assets will stabilize or rise in value, depending on the country, but secondary assets will continue to slide."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some banks also are taking a hit on sales prices as they continue to remove property from their balance sheets. The U.K.'s <span class="companylink">Lloyds Banking Group PLC</span> sold GBP 809 million ($1.29 billion) of Australian corporate real-estate loans for GBP 388 million in June to a joint venture of <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley Real Estate</span> Investing and private-equity giant <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LLP</span>. Lloyds is now in the process of selling a 2 billion euro Irish loan portfolio, dubbed Project Pittlane, which is expected to go at a hefty discount, a person with knowledge of the sale says. Lloyds declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other major sellers include publicly traded property companies, which will sell 8.6 billion euros of better-quality assets while they might become buyers for secondary property, said <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span>. Some 27 billion euros will come to market as the result of distressed mortgages that were converted into commercial mortgage-backed securities during the boom years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S.-based private-equity giant <span class="companylink">Carlyle Group</span> still has some 500 million euros to spend on offices, retail and residential buildings in top European cities for its third fund, which has already spent 1.7 billion euros on assets including hotels and offices. It is also working on a fourth fund, which will be similar in size to the third.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are convinced that there will be many opportunities for us coming from players' deleveraging needs," said Eric Sasson, managing director at Carlyle. "We are quite bullish on the largest economies in Europe: France, Germany, the U.K. and the Nordics," he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.K.-based fund manager Schroders Investment Management, which has GBP 194.6 billion of assets under management, is also in the process of setting up a GBP 1 billion European fund, which it will invest in "low-risk and good-quality assets."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most sales so far have been in Europe's largest and most-liquid markets, such as London and Paris. But the market is likely to see deals involving property located in southern European countries and older buildings in Germany.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> expects 96 billion euros of property to come from Spain and 49 billion euros from Italy, two markets that have virtually collapsed, with few property transactions taking place currently. "We are looking for assets in Spain and Italy as long as we can build it into our pricing," said Markus Meijer, chief executive of U.K.-based private real-estate investment manager, Meyer Bergman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meyer Bergman this summer launched a 1 billion euro fund targeting retail property that is aiming to buy between 10 and 12 shopping malls in Europe. "We see a lot of appetite from U.S. investors wanting to buy in Europe, who previously focused on home markets," said Markus Meijer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the closure of German open-ended funds will provide more buying opportunities. Such funds are likely to dispose of 31 billion euros of property within three to five years, said property-services company <span class="companylink">CBRE Group</span>.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Craig Karmin and Kris Hudson </div><div>729 words</div><div>12 September 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C11</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Starwood Capital Group</span>, the private real-estate investment firm headed by industry veteran Barry Sternlicht, is exploring the sale of a stake in the company, according to people who have spoken with Starwood executives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Greenwich, Conn.-based firm has hired investment bankers at <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> to conduct the search for a buyer, these people said. While it is unclear what percentage of the firm would be available, people familiar with Starwood's thinking said it is expected to be a minority interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spokesmen for Starwood and <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With about $19 billion in real-estate assets under management, Starwood is one of the world's largest property investors and focuses on higher-risk, higher-return property investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sternlict, who built his reputation by investing in hotels and lodging, is credited with helping to popularize the boutique hotel concept with the creation of the W Hotel chain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate executives say the sale of a general partnership stake can be a natural evolution for many private investment firms, including hedge funds and buyout shops. But the reasons for a sale can vary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some firms view a sale of a small interest to a longtime investor in their funds as a way to strengthen an existing relationship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In most cases, these firms market stakes to large investors that already have made commitments to the asset manager and view an ownership stake as a way to share in the profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Carlyle Group LP</span>, the Washington-based private-equity firm, sold a 5.5% stake to Calpers, a giant California pension fund, in 2001, and another 7.7% interest to Mubadala, an Abu Dhabi sovereign-wealth fund, before going public earlier this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rival buyout firm TPG Holdings last year sold a 4.5% stake to sovereign-wealth funds in Kuwait and Singapore, which gave that private-equity firm fresh capital for new investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some smaller investment firms have sold controlling interests in order to expand their footprint. In 2010, Simsbury, Conn.-based real-estate investor Landmark Partners sold a 55% interest to India's <span class="companylink">Religare Enterprises Ltd</span>. to help the U.S. firm tap foreign markets and offer new products, Landmark officials said at the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any Starwood sale would offer Mr. Sternlicht, the firm's chairman and chief executive, the opportunity to cash out some of his holdings in the firm he founded in 1991.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also could establish a value for the company, which could prove useful if Starwood has any future plans of selling shares to the public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sale also would give a buyer a slice of Starwood's management fees and a share of Starwood's carried interest, or 20% of the profits that Starwood collects after certain performance hurdles are met.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those management fees can range as high as 1.25% on real-estate assets that last year topped $18 billion, according to Starwood fund marketing material.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starwood has raised about $2 billion toward its current fund, with a target amount of around $3 billion. The fund is focusing on distressed real estate and property loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sternlicht spent much of the 1980s at <span class="companylink">JMB Realty</span> in Chicago before striking out on his own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He made his first mark during the commercial-real-estate collapse of the early 1990s purchasing properties on the cheap from the government's <span class="companylink">Resolution Trust Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later Mr. Sternlicht founded the <span class="companylink">Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts</span> Worldwide chain and built it into a multibillion-dollar behemoth on par with giants <span class="companylink">Marriott International Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Hilton Worldwide Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sternlicht left <span class="companylink">Starwood Hotels</span> in 2005 amid a dispute with the board over his role and his choice of successor. <span class="companylink">Starwood Hotels</span> now counts 1,112 hotels in 100 countries under its brands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, one of Mr. Sternlicht's biggest deals was Starwood Capital's 2009 purchase of the $4.5 billion real-estate loan portfolio of Corus Bank, a failed condominium lender.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His firm also has purchased portfolios of midscale and upscale hotels, foreclosed on and revamped a Viceroy resort in the Caribbean and built his fledgling hotel brands Baccarat, Crillon and 1.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LITHONIA, Ga. -- On a muggy morning earlier this month, Paul Fuhrman pried the screen off a window to get into a two-story house in this Atlanta suburb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was just another day's work for the 43-year-old executive at private-equity firm <span class="companylink">Colony Capital LLC</span>, based in Santa Monica, Calif. After buying the house for $120,000 in a foreclosure auction, Mr. Furhman and his colleagues wanted to check out Colony's new investment -- and broke in because they hadn't gotten the keys yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fuhrman's sweat and dirty hands show how the business of buying foreclosed homes, renovating and renting them out is morphing from a largely mom-and-pop business into the next big thing on Wall Street. Investors who once chased only big-ticket deals now are buying houses one at a time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We went from hunting elephants to whacking ants with a mallet," says Mr. Fuhrman, who found stained carpets, piles of discarded clothing, a broken door and signs of a recent living-room camp out by squatters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colony owns about 3,600 foreclosed homes, including 133 bought in the Atlanta area in one day, and officials hope to increase the firm's inventory to 10,000 by next spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to investment bank <span class="companylink">Jefferies &amp; Co</span>., major financial firms led by Colony, <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span>, Och-Ziff Capital Management and <span class="companylink">Oaktree Capital Group LLC</span> have raised more than $8 billion to buy houses, largely in markets pummeled by the housing crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first, many investors hoped lenders would sell foreclosed houses in bulk. But most banks prefer to sell one house at a time, figuring that approach will fetch higher prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, the foreclosure circuit hasn't yet produced a giant windfall for buyers like Colony, though executives say early returns are promising. Yields on rents from houses owned by the firm are 7% to 8%, higher than many other types of real estate. Purchase prices have averaged 12% less than Colony expected, which should make it easier to sell the homes or borrow against them and exit with double-digit percentage gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anthony Myers, a senior managing director with <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>'s real-estate group, said that while the cost of operating in the foreclosed-home business is "incredibly high," the buyout firm is well positioned. "We, like others, believe in the housing recovery and we believe there's a great role for folks like us to come in, buy these homes," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are in the sixth inning of the opportunity to buy distressed homes and rent them out," says John Burns, a real-estate consultant in Irvine, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> and Colony have been especially aggressive in foreclosure-racked Georgia. On a Tuesday morning, about 200 people gathered in front of the courthouse in Gwinnett County as an auctioneer opened the bidding on about 900 homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Game on," said Albo Antonucci, a buyer working for Colony, rushing to join the crowd.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One early sale was a three-bedroom, two-bathroom house in Duluth, Ga. Bidding started at $43,515. Colony had been studying a published list of thousands of properties to be auctioned this month in the Atlanta area, driving by the houses and doing price comparisons to determine the maximum price the firm could pay for each house and still hit their target yields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jay Byce, a portfolio manager for Colony, glanced at his binder. It showed Colony's maximum bid price for the property was $71,000. After about 20 offers, he entered the bidding -- and won the house for $53,400.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Georgia, buyers of foreclosed houses usually pay on the spot. Mr. Byce turned to a colleague who held a locked plastic case full of cashier's checks. In all, Colony had brought $3 million in checks to the courthouse. On the same day, 52 Colony employees were bidding on homes at seven different county courthouses in Georgia, and spent a total of about $9 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under a red canopy tent, Evan Jaleh, a third-year associate at Colony, sat at a laptop set up at a card table, entering Colony's winning bids into a spreadsheet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearby, Dallas Tanner, a principal with property-management company Treehouse Group, Tempe, Ariz., gave orders and distributed cashier's checks to his team, which usually buys using funds from <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surge in interest from financial firms has boosted foreclosure sales. About one-third of homes in recent foreclosure auctions in Gwinnett County were sold, up from 15% six months to a year ago, estimates auctioneer Doug Hardegree. Unsold homes go back to the lender.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The arrival of private-equity firms and hedge funds rankles smaller investors, many of whom try to quickly "flip" their purchases for a profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you've got four or five major investment firms bidding, you can't get anything out there," says Niana Hill, who sat in a courthouse cafe during a break in the auction. "I like 20% yields or more. I don't like 10%."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colony executives say the numbers look fine to them. Once the private-equity firm spends about $11,000 to renovate the house in Lithonia, Colony expects to rent it for about $1,550 a month. After taxes, fees and other expenses, Colony investors should get a net yield on this house of 8.2% a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colony has indicated it may take its rental business public or sell its homes after values appreciate. "When I look at other opportunities out there in the commercial-real-estate space, to get the same current yield, adjusting for risk, it's very difficult," Mr. Fuhrman says. "Of all the real-estate asset classes, this is probably the most liquid."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seven years after buying the New York Marriott East Side and then plowing roughly $26 million into renovating it, Prime Property Fund wants to sell the Midtown hotel for up to $350 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime Property, a $10 billion-plus fund run by <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>, bought the hotel in November 2005 from <span class="companylink">Strategic Hotel Capital LLC</span> for $287 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fund has hired brokerage Eastdil Secured to market the debt-free, 646-room hotel on Lexington and 49th Street. The seller envisions a price tag in the range of $350 million, or about $542,000 per room, which might be achievable given the strength of the hotel-transaction market in New York this year, according to a person familiar with the fund's strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime Property typically invests in larger, less volatile real-estate assets than hotels, such as offices buildings. As a result, the fund doesn't typically hold such "noncore" assets as the Marriott for long before looking to sell them, this person said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hotel, which is subject to a long-term management agreement with <span class="companylink">Marriott International</span>, includes roughly 22,000 square feet of meeting space, restaurants and a fitness center. It now generates annual net operating income in the range of $10 million to $11 million, down by half from its pace during the boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime Property has approval from the city and Marriott to convert the hotel's 16th-floor concierge lounge to 10 additional suites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kris Hudson</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Office Building Values are Flat…Again</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan office building values in August remained stuck in the rut they've been in for about a year, according to a new report by Green Street Advisors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The California firm's Manhattan Office Price Index—which tracks properties owned by real estate investment trusts—was unchanged last month at about 21% below the peak it hit in the middle of 2007. That's roughly the same level the index has been at since the summer of 2011, when Europe's financial problems bubbled over in a sign that the global economic downturn was far from over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news is that commercial property values are well above the low point they hit in the middle of 2009. Since then they have risen 74%, according to Green Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"High-quality Manhattan office buildings remain a highly sought-after real estate investment amid exceptionally low interest rates," Green Street said in a report. "However, political and economic uncertainty are weighing on leasing decisions and are likely affecting investor confidence."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Values in Midtown have recovered more rapidly than downtown. Midtown office properties have bounced back 84% since the mid-2009 trough. Downtown buildings have recovered only 33%, Green Street reports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Longer term, though, "Downtown's future looks brighter its past," the report states. "Over the next few years Downtown will benefit from infrastructure improvements," it says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the report also warns: "The World Trade Center towers remain a large source of space availability and uncertainty."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter Grant</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan: 'Meh' on Malls</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York City's top shopping districts may boast the most expensive retail space in the world. But when it comes to shopping malls, the rents in the New York region rank far below those in other global cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's one of the conclusions of a new report set to be released Monday by real-estate firm <span class="companylink">Cushman &amp; Wakefield Inc</span>. The average asking rent per square foot on Fifth Avenue between 49th and 60th streets fetched as much as $2,067 in the second quarter of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But average rents at suburban-style enclosed shopping malls in this region were a mere $75 to $150 a square foot, the report states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That compares with other U.S. cities such as Las Vegas and the Washington, D.C., metro area that are performing slightly better, at $200-$225 and $125-$135 per square foot, respectively. And in the second quarter of 2012, prime shopping center rents in Hong Kong were $927 per square foot per year, the report states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price variation partly reflects the preference many New York City dwellers have for ground-level stores. Vertical malls, especially in Manhattan, generally haven't been popular with shoppers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the city's hottest shopping areas see densely packed crowds and stores rivaling the most popular malls in the world. "What we're monitoring is density," says Matt Winn, the head of C&amp;W retail for the Americas. "SoHo is a mall without a roof."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the report, the impact of globalization, e-commerce, and a shaky economy on retail has been polarizing: owners of prime shopping centers have had to tailor their tenancy to the greater number of consumers either at the high-end or discount segment of retail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report also finds that because traditional anchor stores like JC Penny and <span class="companylink">Best Buy</span> are struggling with low revenue growth, mall owners are resizing physical spaces to reflect new visitor traffic drivers like Apple and Whole Foods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think our lifestyles are changing," says Mr. Winn. "And that necessitates a whole new look and feel to the mall."</p>

</p><div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">WEEKEND INVESTOR --- The New New-Home Market --- Demand for Freshly Built Homes Is Heating Up, and Steep Bargains Are Vanishing Fast; Here's How to Get a Good Deal</span>
</div><div class="author">By Ruth Simon </div><div>1845 words</div><div>8 September 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B7</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six years after the U.S. housing market tumbled into the abyss, demand for brand-new homes is picking up. Sales are on the rise, and prices in many areas are inching higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bad news for buyers: The new market environment means less discounting, fewer incentives and, in some cases, longer waits for homes. But there are several steps you can take to be a better shopper -- from choosing amenities judiciously to waiting until a home is partially built before pulling the trigger on a deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low interest rates and improving economic conditions are persuading people like Jerold Hawkins to take the plunge. Mr. Hawkins, a software developer for the auto industry, and his wife, Katherine, a nurse, recently agreed to buy a new five-bedroom home in Rochester Hills, Mich., for $289,900. "I now have a really good job and so does my wife," Mr. Hawkins says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The auto industry's recovery has spurred demand for new homes in the $180,000 to $500,000 price range in the Detroit area, says Dan Elsea, president of brokerage Real Estate One in Detroit. In the choicest neighborhoods, even homes built without a ready buyer often sell long before completion and with multiple offers, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the new-home market's dismal performance of the past few years, any improvement is welcome. The median price plunged 22% from its peak of $262,600 in March 2007 to a low of $204,200 in October 2010, with some markets tumbling 50% or more. Just 306,000 new homes were sold last year, says the U.S. Commerce Department, the lowest on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the tide seems to be turning. New-home sales rose in July for the third time in four months. And with inventories at record lows, builders are trimming incentives and raising prices in markets such as Detroit, Houston, New York and Phoenix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, sales of new homes surged 22% from September through July, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>. The median price of new homes sold in July stood at $224,200, up 9.8% from their 2010 lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're clearly in recovery," says Douglas Yearley Jr., chief executive of luxury builder <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> in Horsham, Pa., which builds in 20 states nationwide. In August, Toll reported the most sustained demand in more than five years. Stronger markets include Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York, while Illinois and Las Vegas are softer, the company says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Billie Armenta, a government employee, says she is surprised the $294,900 base price of her new home in Phoenix has risen by more than $33,000 since she and her husband, Ruben, a retiree, signed their contract in January. The couple had to wait six weeks for an appointment at the design center and nearly eight months for construction to be completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The much larger market for existing homes is perking up as well. Prices in June posted their first year-over-year increase in nearly two years, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index of 20 major metropolitan areas. From September 2011 through July 2012, sales jumped 5%, according to the NAHB.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, the housing recovery is still in its infancy, with credit tight and sales and prices well below historical levels. Rising interest rates, an uptick in the supply of foreclosed homes or a weakening economy all could crimp sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after years of retrenching, builders have whittled down their stockpiles greatly, and are being cautious about bringing new homes to market. The inventory of unsold new homes now stands at 144,000, down from a peak of 575,000 in July 2006, the Commerce Department reports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the current sales pace, that's a 4.9 month supply of new homes; six months is considered a balanced market, says NAHB chief economist David Crowe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the biggest changes since the downturn is where new homes are being built. The new homes are located much more closely to job centers than they were five years ago, says John Burns of John Burns Real Estate Consulting in Irvine, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some builders are rolling out features not likely to be found in the resale market. <span class="companylink">KB Home</span>, which is based in Los Angeles and builds in 10 states and Washington, D.C., lets buyers choose whether the master bedroom is on the first or second floor. In Southern California, the company has consulted with feng shui masters on home design.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">PulteGroup</span>, which is based in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., and builds in 29 states, offers the "Pulte Planning Center," a secondary office space off the main living room that helps homeowners stay organized and monitor their children's homework.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New Home Co. in Aliso Viejo, Calif., offers a multigenerational home with a private living space for an older parent or child returning home after college. "We can take any walk-in pantry we have and turn it into a separate cooking facility," says New Home Chief Executive H. Lawrence Webb. <span class="companylink">Lennar</span>, meanwhile, offers a "Next Gen" home aimed at baby boomers with aging parents or boomerang kids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders also are touting energy efficiency. <span class="companylink">Meritage Homes</span>, which is based in Scottsdale, Ariz., and builds in seven states, lets buyers spend the credits they can apply to upgrades or financing on solar panels; in some model homes, an entire room is deconstructed to highlight energy-saving features.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another change: Homes are starting to get larger again, after falling during the housing downturn. Among new homes sold in the first half of 2012, the median square footage was 2,013, up from a recent low of 1,945 in 2009, according to Hanley Wood Market Intelligence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts say larger homes are more attractive to the trade-up buyers who now dominate the new-home market. Steve Ruffner, president of KB Home, Southern California, says buyers can afford bigger homes because prices and interest rates have fallen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, what you will get for your money depends on local conditions. If you are thinking about a new home, here are some points to consider.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Don't be fooled by the sticker price. "The base price always looks incredibly good," says Lloyd Fox, a real-estate broker at Long Realty in Scottsdale, but upgrades typically add 10% to 15%, sometimes more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Billie Armenta, the Phoenix home buyer, says the purchase price for her home rose by more than $55,000 to $350,000 once the fee for a choice lot, carpeting, higher-quality cabinets and other upgrades were figured in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Expect to pay a premium. The median new home sold for 36% more than the median existing home last year, excluding distressed properties that were foreclosed on, according to Hanley Wood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That spread is wider than in the recent past. The gap had narrowed to just 28% in 2009, when builders were scrambling to unload inventory built during the housing boom. Since 2005 the gap has averaged 34%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Remember that location matters. Your ability to negotiate a good deal can vary even within the same locale. "We have some markets where we're raising prices on every plan pretty significantly," Standard Pacific chief financial officer Jeff McCall told investors in July. "And then 10 miles down the road we have stagnant pricing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Closer-in developments generally command a premium versus homes in outlying areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Tucson, builders are offering discounts from the list price on homes built without a ready buyer in the Dove Mountain area, which was hard hit by the housing bust, says Laura Sayers, a vice president at Long Realty. Less than 10 miles away, in Oro Valley, demand for new homes is so strong there is a waiting list for new lots, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Negotiate aggressively. Incentives are getting smaller, on average, but buyers in some markets still have a fair amount of bargaining power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Tampa Bay, Fla., area, builders are buying down interest rates, paying closing costs and tossing in appliances, says Jaci Stone, an agent at Century 21 Beggins Realty, who had one builder kick in two months' rent so a client could break a lease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hayley and Tyler Sutterby recently nabbed $20,000 in upgrades instead of the standard $8,000 package when they bought a four-bedroom home under construction in Lithia, Fla. The couple is spending the credits on higher-quality cabinets and flooring, a tankless water heater and other features, says Ms. Sutterby, who works in marketing for a cable company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Be tactical. The closer a home is to completion, the fewer choices you get to make, but the more likely the builder is to make a deal. That's because builders don't want to end up saddled with finished homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So keep an eye out for homes near completion or in inventory, says Ms. Stone, the Tampa agent, who adds that publicly traded builders are often more willing to make a deal at the end of a quarter or fiscal year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Prepare to wait. When home prices were tumbling, buyers were regularly advised to sell their current homes before buying new ones -- or risk being stuck with two mortgages. But with inventories at record lows, buyers might have to wait three to six months for their new home to be completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That can make timing tricky for move-up buyers. Martin Mitchell, vice chief executive of Mitchell &amp; Best Homebuilders in Rockville, Md., suggests that buyers in stronger markets prepare their home for sale, but wait until construction is under way before bringing it to market. Or sell your home and rent it back for a few months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Understand your financing options. Builders often will pay closing costs or provide other incentives if you get your mortgage from them. But the deals offered by builders aren't always better than what you might get from another lender, says Greg McBride, a senior financial analyst at Bankrate.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because their credit lines are limited, more builders are asking buyers to take out construction loans that roll into a standard mortgage once the home is completed instead of having the builder finance the construction, with the borrower taking out a mortgage when the sale closes. The bank makes payments to the builder, typically as construction goals are met, with the buyer generally paying interest only on the funds used.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyone considering this option, "should at least have some sense of what the permanent financing costs will be," even if you can't lock in a mortgage rate, to make sure payments are affordable, advises Keith Gumbinger, a vice president at mortgage-data provider HSH.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To reduce fees, arrange to close on both loans at the same time instead of closing first on the construction loan and then later on the mortgage.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Fiona Law   </div><div>710 words</div><div>7 September 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HONG KONG -- Signs of a turnaround in China's property market have sparked a rally in bonds of the nation's developers, making them among Asia's best performers this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Midsize and large developers have benefited the most from investor demand, taking advantage of the interest by returning to bond markets after being largely shut out for several months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gains have come after some local governments in China have rolled out programs to encourage home buying while nationwide curbs on the property market remain in place. Lower interest rates and more mortgage lending have also contributed to the pickup in housing prices and transactions in the past two months after a decline in the first half. The rising activity has boosted builders' revenue and reduced their debt burdens. The rally in bond prices accelerated as the companies released earnings in the past few weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Investor appetite is there," said Anthony Arnaudy, <span class="companylink">Standard Chartered PLC</span>'s head of capital markets in northeast Asia. "The fundamentals of the Chinese property sector are healthier."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bond prices of large developers such as <span class="companylink">Country Garden Holdings Co</span>., <span class="companylink">Longfor Properties Co</span>. and <span class="companylink">Shimao Property Holdings Ltd</span>. have risen 40% to 50% since October. That has beaten the J.P. Morgan <span class="companylink">Asia Credit</span> Index, which is up 17% over the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many investors say there is more room for developers' bond prices to rise, although fund managers are becoming cautious as the rally progresses, staying clear of smaller, debt-laden firms. Country Garden, Longfor and Shimao didn't respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Midsize developer <span class="companylink">Guangzhou R&amp;F Properties</span>, which focuses on middle-class residential projects, received strong demand last month for $238 million of bonds, receiving almost 10 times the amount on offer as investors were lured by the 11.875% interest rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yu-Ming Wang, Manulife Asset Management's Asia head of fixed income, whose team manages $36 billion of assets, said he is buying bonds of property companies but is being choosy. "We remain highly selective and only pick the top half a dozen players with strong track records and good financial discipline," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pickup in the $36 billion Chinese property bond market is significant because it is watched by global investors eager for insights into the financial health of China's developers. The sector has been a big driver of China's economic growth, which expanded 7.6% in the second quarter compared with the year-earlier period. Most of these developers have below-investment-grade, or "junk," credit ratings. Demand for these bonds signals an increase in investor appetite for risky assets and a tacit, if nascent, endorsement of the property sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of 2011, most bonds from Chinese developers were trading at distressed levels, as low as 60 cents on the dollar in some cases. Those low prices made them attractive to investors seeking high yields, especially as the worst of the global economic troubles passed, said some fund managers. Bond yields move inversely to prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, "in a low-rate environment, capital is still looking for higher returns in the Asian high-yield market, and Chinese real-estate issuers have benefited from the bargain-hunting," said Angus Hui, Asian fixed-income fund manager at Schroder Investment Management (Hong Kong) Ltd.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the market is far from healed after last year's rout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While issuance has picked up, it still lags behind last year. Some 11 bonds valued at a combined $3.48 billion have been sold so far in 2012, compared with 18 bonds totaling $8.21 billion in the same period last year, according to data provider Dealogic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bankers don't expect a jump in issuance through the rest of the year. Many companies don't need the money, in part because they have scaled back expansion plans, and uncertainty about future government policy remains, said Augusto King, <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC</span>'s head of debt capital markets in Asia.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Moody's Veteran Cracks the Whip -- Again --- Tad Philipp Grows Concerned About Retail Properties Facing Competition; Some Wall Street Debt Dealers Are Miffed</span>
</div><div class="author">By Al Yoon </div><div>943 words</div><div>5 September 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C18</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tad Philipp is at it again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The veteran of <span class="companylink">Moody's Investors Service</span>'s commercial-mortgage group, who fought back against loose underwriting during the real-estate bubble, has drawn a new line in the sand against similar practices, leaving some Wall Street dealers miffed -- and itching to take their business elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time around, Mr. Philipp is growing more concerned about retail properties that are particularly vulnerable to competition from online shopping and nearby outlet stores. He is taking a more-cautious approach toward evaluating these properties, forcing Wall Street underwriters to boost credit protection for senior bondholders. That is reducing the firms' profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We think we are at a fork in the road," Mr. Philipp said of retail property. Most luxury malls, as well as community centers anchored by grocers and other retailers of daily needs, will be fine, he said. But properties facing tough competition from nearby properties or with already low sales "are going to suffer," he warned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Philipp's tougher standards hearken back to <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> more-sweeping response in April 2007, as real estate was overheating with the help of commercial-mortgage securities, whose volume had more than quadrupled over the previous five years to $228 billion by 2007. <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> began demanding more credit protection, turning underwriters to other rating firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By July of that year, <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> market share had "done a complete flip," Mr. Philipp complained in a report at the time, accusing Wall Street banks of "ratings shopping."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"<span class="companylink">Moody's</span> was one of the few firms who did something about aggressive underwriting, and the market was quick to punish them," said David Rodgers, a principal at Park Bridge Financial who managed <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch &amp; Co</span>'s commercial-mortgage securitizations from 2001 to 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But <span class="companylink">Moody's</span>, which rehired Mr. Philipp in March 2011 as director of commercial real-estate research after he did a three-year stint at <span class="companylink">CW Financial Services</span>, is sitting with a luxury it didn't have in 2007. This time, <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> has so far been able to act with impunity, with <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>, its top competitor, hobbled by a costly move last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dealers have shunned S&amp;P on large, multiloan commercial mortgage securities deals for the past year, after the firm upended the market by yanking its ratings from a <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Citigroup Inc</span>. commercial-mortgage bond in July 2011. The failure to rate the Goldman-Citi issue came after a last-minute review revealed a disparity in its rating models.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An S&amp;P spokesman declined to comment on Tuesday. Earlier this year, S&amp;P launched an effort to overhaul its commercial mortgage bond ratings system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Moody's</span> was hired in S&amp;P's place to rate the deal as Goldman and <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> revived its deal and the firm has been on every multiloan deal since.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They [<span class="companylink">Moody's</span>] know they will be on every securitization, along with Fitch [Ratings] or Kroll [Bond Ratings], so why not be super conservative?" asks Matthew Sharp, a managing principal with Hamilton Point Investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A handful of dealers say they are ready to bury the hatchet with S&amp;P, however. Some said they would begin shifting business to S&amp;P as soon as the firm finalizes its new ratings model, which is expected to be more lenient than <span class="companylink">Moody's</span>. S&amp;P has shown its new model would increase the portion of investment-grade ratings on some single-loan commercial mortgage securities it has rated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some Wall Street dealers said S&amp;P might be hired along with <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> on commercial-mortgage bond deals to test investor confidence in S&amp;P. Indeed, <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co</span>. has asked S&amp;P to rate an coming multiloan offering, according to people briefed on the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Philipp and Michael Gerdes, who is the head of commercial-mortgage bond surveillance at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span>, aren't fazed despite protests from Wall Street and the prospect of lost business. They say their skepticism of regional malls is warranted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Messrs. Philipp and Gerdes also reject assertions by issuers that they weren't transparent with their views, which call for more "stress scenarios" on malls with disadvantages, such as living in the shadow of more-successful retail centers. The formula has been applied to troubled loans for years, so it shouldn't be a "foreign concept," Mr. Gerdes said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bond buyers wary of S&amp;P's history of rating and criteria changes could demand more yield from S&amp;P-rated bonds in the new and secondary markets, eliminating any advantage of avoiding the <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> model, analysts say. Mr. Philipp said he has drawn support from buyers of riskier commercial-mortgage securities just as he has challenges from dealers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"<span class="companylink">Moody's</span> is now an investor favorite because history proved them right and the investors haven't forgotten that yet," said Mr. Rodgers of Park Bridge Financial</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a recent interview, Mr. Philipp reeled off examples of failing retail properties, which have resulted in some of the biggest losses in CMBS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, part of the troubled Highland Mall in Austin, Texas, was sold in August for $1.5 million. That property was backed by a $61 million loan and the sale created one of the largest losses ever for commercial-mortgage bondholders.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Vanessa Fuhrmans </div><div>638 words</div><div>5 September 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C22</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years after its restoration as reunified Germany's capital, Berlin built for an office-market boom that never took off. Its newfound status as Europe's Internet start-up mecca, though, may be changing that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lured by Berlin's modest rents and a creative class teeming with young, tech-savvy engineers and Web developers, Internet firms from <span class="companylink">Amazon.com Inc</span>. to European online shoe retailer <span class="companylink">Zalando GmbH</span> to Berlin-based website-clone incubator Rocket Internet GmbH have snapped up Berlin office space at furious pace over the past couple of years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some, such as <span class="companylink">Groupon Inc</span>., have expanded so fast they have had to spread out over multiple offices in the city before finding new, bigger space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The activity has propelled Berlin's office-rental turnover to record levels over the past year. In the first half of 2012, companies leased some 330,000 square meters (3.6 million square feet) of new office space, edging out Germany's reigning real-estate market, Munich, for the first time in more than a decade, according to property-services firm <span class="companylink">Cushman &amp; Wakefield Inc</span>. "Today, nearly "60% of our [new] customers are companies working in e-commerce," said Hanns-Joachim Fredrich, a Berlin partner at the firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That surge in demand, combined with investors' search for safer havens amid the debt crisis engulfing southern Europe, makes the capital ripe for a renaissance in office-building investment, some developers say. "After the disappointment of the 1990s boom, many foreign investors are taking another look at Berlin again," said Stefan Klingsohr, head of Berlin real-estate developer and consulting firm Klingsohr Gruppe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A specialist in restoring old, historic buildings into shiny new loft-like commercial spaces, Mr. Klingsohr's company currently is renovating the second half of a prewar cigarette factory in Berlin's trendy Prenzlauerberg district and the century-old headquarters of what was once Germany's premier film studio, located near Checkpoint Charlie -- both of which will house primarily Internet companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A private British investor, which bought the former film-studio offices from a <span class="companylink">Commerzbank</span> unit, is funding the restoration, which will provide about 11,000 square meters of commercial space, Mr. Klingsohr said. The developer is negotiating with several firms to lease offices there for between 15 euros ($19) and 18 euros a square meter -- above the city's average but below Berlin's top rental prices of about 21.50 euros a square meter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such small-scale historical renovation projects are typical of the nascent boom: Alongside another section of the former Wall, for instance, Berlin-based business "angel investor" JMES Investments and local property firm S+P Real Estate are developing an 8,500-square-meter start-up "factory" on the site of a former brewery. Berlin-based music-sharing platform SoundCloud and Firefox browser developer <span class="companylink">Mozilla Corp</span>., which set up shop in the German capital this summer, will anchor what is aimed at operating as a hub for young technology firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But more-ambitious, new-building projects are rarer, evidence of Berlin's ever-fickle property market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city's still-low rents compared with more-affluent markets such as Munich and Frankfurt are part of the attraction for young, hungry start-ups. But they also reflect a local unemployment rate of 12% -- nearly double the national average -- and a big reason investors remain skittish about building big, new office towers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For 20 euros per square meter, no one could afford to build a state-of-the-art high-rise," said Mr. Fredrich of Cushman &amp; Wakefield. "We don't have any industry sector here that is used to paying the rents it would take."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average fixed mortgage rates in the U.S. retreated over the past week, halting a gradual rise seen over the previous month, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the week ended Thursday, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 3.59%, compared with 3.66% the previous week and 4.22% a year earlier. Rates on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 2.86%, versus 2.89% a week earlier and 3.39% a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Freddie Mac chief economist Frank Nothaft noted, "Treasury bond yields fell, allowing mortgage rates to follow" after the release of minutes from the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s monetary-policy committee. Mortgage rates turned lower despite continuing signs of improvement in the housing market in recent months, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The release of <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller home-price indexes for June earlier this week showed that U.S. home prices ended the second quarter with the first positive annual growth rates across the national, 10 major-metropolitan-area and 20-city indexes since the summer of 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five-year Treasury-indexed hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages, or ARMs, averaged 2.78%, compared with 2.8% the previous week and the 2.96% rate set a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One-year Treasury-indexed ARM rates averaged 2.63%, compared with 2.66% the prior week and 2.89% a year earlier.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's stock market fell to a fresh 3 1/2-year low, and mining stocks dropped, but Japanese technology stocks rose on deal speculation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moves in Asian benchmarks were muted as investors continued to wait for a policy signal from the U.S. Federal Reserve. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke will speak Friday at an annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo., and investors will look for any sign that the central bank could undertake additional measures to stimulate the U.S. economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Low volumes and small moves in stocks are saying that no one has a clue on which way things should go," said James White, senior analyst at First State Investments, which has $150 billion of assets under management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Tokyo, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 companies added 0.4% to 9069.81. <span class="companylink">Renesas Electronics</span> soared 35% on news that private-equity firm <span class="companylink">Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co</span>. had approached the struggling semiconductor manufacturer with an investment offer. Shares in one of Renesas's major shareholders, NEC, climbed 6.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sharp jumped 7% ahead of talks on Thursday with Terry Gou, the chairman of contract manufacturing giant Hon Hai Precision Industry, which has agreed to take a capital stake in the struggling electronics company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Daikin Industries</span> dropped 3.5% after the company said it had agreed to buy U.S. home air-conditioner company <span class="companylink">Goodman Global</span> in a deal worth $3.7 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Shanghai Composite fell 1% to 2053.23, its lowest close since Feb. 2, 2009, on pessimism over the local economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid the downbeat sentiment, the influential state-run China Securities Journal urged China to cut banks' reserve-requirement ratio, adding that the effects of reverse repurchase offerings, the money market instrument used by <span class="companylink">China's central bank</span> to pump cash into the market, are only short-term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report came after the <span class="companylink">People's Bank of China</span> injected a net 278 billion yuan ($43.9 billion) into the money market last week, its biggest weekly liquidity injection in seven months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Metals companies, which jumped Tuesday because of expectations for further share buybacks following <span class="companylink">Baoshan Iron &amp; Steel</span>'s repurchase announcement, were among the biggest decliners. <span class="companylink">Baoshan Iron &amp; Steel</span> fell 2.7% and <span class="companylink">Wuhan Iron &amp; Steel</span> lost 1.6%, both in Shanghai, while Angang Steel dropped 1.1% in Shenzhen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index eased 0.1% to 19788.51 as the market digested more earnings reports from Chinese companies.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Evergrande Real Estate Group</span> lost 3.1% after reporting that core earnings were down 21% in the first half, as the developer cut property prices to increase sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Want Want China led blue-chip decliners, tumbling 4.5%, as the snacks-and-beverages maker reported a 38% rise in its first-half net profit that fell short of expectations.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asian markets were mixed Wednesday as the wait continued for a <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> signal, while there was a flurry of activity in Japan's technology sector. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke will speak Friday at an annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Low volumes and small moves in stocks are saying that no one has a clue on which way things should go," said James White, senior analyst at First State Investments, which has $150 billion of assets under management. "It could change very quickly, as September could be a manic month."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Nikkei added 0.4% to 9069.81, as a busy session for the technology sector spiced up the day's trading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Renesas Electronics</span> soared 35% after news that private-equity firm <span class="companylink">Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co</span>. had approached the struggling semiconductor manufacturer with an investment offer. Shares in one of Renesas's major shareholders, NEC, climbed 6.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sharp jumped 7% ahead of talks on Thursday with Terry Gou, chairman of contract manufacturing giant Hon Hai Precision Industry, which has agreed to take a capital stake in the struggling electronics company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Daikin Industries</span> dropped 3.5% after the company said that it had agreed to buy U.S. home air conditioner company <span class="companylink">Goodman Global</span> in a deal worth $3.7 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index fell 0.1% to 19788.51 as the market digested more earnings reports from Chinese companies. China Life Insurance added 2%, as investors focused more on its 2.5% growth in new business value than its 26% decline in first-half net profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also in Hong Kong, <span class="companylink">Evergrande Real Estate Group</span> lost 3.1% after reporting that core earnings were down 21% in the first half, as the developer cut property prices to increase sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Shanghai Composite was 1% down to 2053.23, due to pessimism over the local economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In South Korea, the Kospi was up 0.6% to 1928.54, supported by a 2.9% gain for heavyweight constituent <span class="companylink">Samsung Electronics</span>, continuing to climb back from Monday's 7.5% drop, which followed a U.S. court ruling that it had violated some patents belonging to Apple.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Australia's S&amp;P ASX 200 inched down 0.1% to 4356.4, as a 4.6% overnight drop in the price of iron ore—to its lowest level since November 2009—dragged on producers of the commodity, especially the ones investing heavily to expand their capacity.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices in June posted their first year-over-year increase in nearly two years, according to a widely watched index released on Tuesday, as more buyers chased fewer homes on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index of 20 major metropolitan areas showed home prices rose by 0.5% in June, compared with a year ago, to end a 20-month streak of declines. Home prices are still down by nearly 31% from their 2006 peak but have returned to mid-2003 levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate national index released by Case-Shiller said prices were up by 1.2% from a year ago and by 2.2% from the first quarter, on a seasonally adjusted basis. The quarterly gain was the largest since late 2005. "This is a clear trend now. We have had a very strong spring season," said Mark Fleming, chief economist at real-estate data firm <span class="companylink">CoreLogic Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday's report follows several others that had pointed to an exceptionally strong bounce in sales this spring. The rebound began to take hold months ago, as the number of homes for sale dropped sharply, especially as banks have listed far fewer foreclosures. In addition, some traditional sellers are holding out for better prices or are unwilling to sell because they owe more than their homes are worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, investors have been aggressively scooping up bargain-priced foreclosures that can be converted into rental properties, while low mortgage rates are giving buyers even more purchasing power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In each of the past three years, home prices have picked up in the spring and summer only to erase those gains in the fall and winter, when sales activity slows. But economists said there is a better chance the low inventories of for-sale homes and stronger demand could prevent prices from dipping below their previous lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have a much better supply-and-demand equilibrium right now," said Mr. Fleming. Compared with previous years' false dawn for housing, "we're much closer to the level of supply matching the albeit-muted level of demand," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report showed that price gains were increasingly broad based, though not every part of the country is benefiting. Of 20 tracked cities, 13 posted year-over-year increases, compared with just seven cities three months ago. Prices in Phoenix were up by 14% from a year ago, continuing a sharp turnaround for the hard-hit market. Prices were below last year's June level in six markets; the worst was Atlanta, which was down by 12%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since prices began falling in 2006, they had previously posted year-over-year increases briefly in 2010, when home buyer tax credits fueled a burst of sales activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market still faces stiff headwinds, including tight lending standards, an economy that isn't producing large job or wage gains, and high levels of homeowners who are underwater, or owe more than their homes are worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists say the recent price gains aren't likely to be sustained at the current pace. Instead, the sharp bounce may reflect the fact that prices in some parts of the country fell so far that they created unusually attractive deals. Some industry executives fret over why demand isn't higher given the low level of mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another concern: While low inventory has helped push prices higher, it also has begun to crimp sales volumes, particularly in Western markets such as Phoenix, Las Vegas and Sacramento, Calif. Some economists say sales of previously owned homes could fall in the coming months, in part because there aren't enough homes for buyers to choose from. That could lift sales of newly built homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"To see real sales-volume gains, you're going to need to see more opportunistic sellers," said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of real-estate brokerage Redfin. "The only people selling are those who are bursting at the seams because they had a third baby or because they took a job out of state."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jillian Holliday has no plans to move out of the house that she bought and renovated in Orlando last October, but that hasn't stopped her from trying to purchase nearby properties that could be fixed up and resold for a profit. She and her father offered to pay $230,000 for a tidy 1920s-era home in downtown Orlando the day it went on the market in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's almost nothing for sale in this neighborhood," said the 30-year-old recruiter. "And the houses you do see sell really quickly." The home is being sold as a short sale, where the seller must receive the bank's approval to sell at a loss. The last buyer walked away from the property after spending eight months under contract. Ms. Holliday hopes the sale will close by September. "It's such a gem," she said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SYDNEY--The Australian dollar was weaker late Tuesday as global financial markets weighed the possibility the U.S. central bank will unveil further stimulus for the misfiring U.S. economy at the end of the week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke is set speak Friday at an annual gathering of central bankers at Jackson Hole, where many expect him to announce more economic assistance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traders said confirmation of so-called quantitative easing, or QE3, would lift the Australian dollar, which is sensitive to global growth expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 0545 GMT, the Australian dollar was buying US$1.0360 down from US$1.0378 late Monday. Against its Japanese counterpart it was buying Y81.32 down from Y81.68.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ray Attrill, the head of currency strategy at <span class="companylink">National Australia Bank</span>, said the biggest risk for markets is in a possible failure by Bernanke to say anything new at the conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If Mr. Bernanke fails to offer a strong signal that more Fed easing is imminent when he speaks on Friday, the U.S. dollar is likely to catch an across-the board bid," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for the moment, trading is subdued as northern hemisphere markets emerge slowly out of Summer holiday mode, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local economic news was scant Tuesday but one housing survey was negative for the Australian dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey of sales of new homes by the Housing Industry Association showed a 5.6% decline in July from June, and an 11.6% slide on year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weak housing report challenges recent assertions by the <span class="companylink">Reserve Bank of Australia</span> that 125 basis points in interest rate cuts since November were beginning to show up in stronger house prices and lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Today's Housing Industry Association New Home Sales report for July is more sober suggesting demand in the new dwelling market remains more tenuous," said David de Garis, senior economist at <span class="companylink">National Australia Bank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The longer-term view of the Australian dollar remains relatively robust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Annette Beacher, head of economic analysis for Asia at <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span>, expects the Australian dollar will trade strongly, averaging US$1.04 in the second half of 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strong central bank demand for the Australian dollar will sustain its strength in the future, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"More than ever we are confident that central banks, global reserve managers and sovereign wealth funds are buyers of the Australian dollar on dips, hence it is extremely difficult to predict that the currency can sustainably trade back to US$0.90 and below in the next two years at least," Beacher said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Robbie Whelan   </div><div>578 words</div><div>24 August 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of newly built homes rose briskly in July, and inventory fell to the lowest level on record, suggesting the housing market is showing continued signs of recovery and that builders may need to ramp up construction in the coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Census Bureau said Thursday builders sold a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 372,000 homes in July, up 26% from the same month last year. Inventory of new homes available for sale fell to 142,000 units, the lowest level recorded since the government started tracking the figure in 1963.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists were encouraged by the report. As home builders continue to deplete their inventories, they will "start construction on more new homes, and that's when construction will start to add to the economy," said Mark Vitner, senior economist with <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo Securities</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report Thursday by the Federal Housing Finance Administration, which regulates mortgage companies <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, showed prices of previously owned homes rose 1.8% in the second quarter from the first-- the biggest quarterly jump in more than six years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in new-home sales partly reflects low stocks of existing, or previously owned, homes. On Wednesday, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> reported that inventory levels for existing homes fell to a 6.4-month supply in July, from a 9.3-month supply a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With so little available in the existing-home market, a growing number of buyers are choosing new homes, to the point where "new home sales growth is outpacing growth in traditional existing sales," says Ivy Zelman, an independent housing analyst who turned bullish on the home-building sector last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Potential buyers are "frustrated" with the existing-home market, says Scott Koppendrayer, director of sales for LDK Homes, a high-end custom builder based in St. Michael, Minn. "The stuff that's left, it's not the nice stuff."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike existing homes, builders are holding the line on prices of new homes. According to the Census Bureau, the median price for a new home sold in July was $224,200, down from $229,900 in July a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Douglas Yearley, chief executive of <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers Inc</span>., the nation's largest builder of large luxury homes, said his company is cautious about raising prices, because it still worries about driving away skittish consumers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're still scared," he said in a conference call with analysts Wednesday. Still, Toll reported strong quarterly earnings Wednesday, with income rising 46% and orders for new homes surging 57% compared with a year earlier. Toll's numbers come on the heels of strong quarterly results for other big public builders, including <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Meritage Homes Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">PulteGroup Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ian Pickering, a 40-year-old information technology director for a defense contractor, said he and his wife had looked at seven previously owned homes, all in the $200,000-to-$400,000 price range, in the last three weeks but were unhappy with the selection. "For the square footage we wanted, there was really nothing on the market," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Pickering family finally decided to look at a new home built by <span class="companylink">Ryland Homes</span>, a large national builder. On Wednesday, the family closed on the purchase of four-bedroom, three-bath ranch house in Lake Nona, outside of Orlando, Fla., for $335,000.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Address: 45431 Greenling Circle, Mendocino.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vital Statistics: A 6,800-square-foot house with four bedrooms, four full bathrooms and two half-bathrooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asking Price: $4.9 million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Previous Sale Price: Sharon Kiss and Ken Hollander paid $1.2 million for the property in 2000 and say they then spent more than $2.8 million remodeling the house and landscaping the yard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notable: The property started out as a second home for the then-Atlanta-based interior designer Ms. Kiss and Mr. Hollander, who has a marketing-research company. After spending 16 months getting the permits to remodel the original house and another 16 months on construction, the couple decided to make Mendocino their home base and downsize in Atlanta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house sits approximately 35 feet from the rocky cliffs of the Mendocino coast. It is being offered fully furnished, down to the outdoor sculpture of a ship known as the Frolic, which is popular with the owners' grandchildren. The real Frolic, a two-masted clipper ship, sank nearby back in 1850.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house, which has a front door imported from Kyoto, Japan, has two masters baths -- one with a stainless-steel Japanese soaking tub and the other with a window overlooking the ocean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple says they are selling because they plan to spend more time with family in Southern California. But they say they will miss the views. "Every day I see something that takes my breath away," says Ms. Kiss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sale price for Mendocino homes was $375,000 for the period April 12 to June 12, down 18% from the same period in 2011, according to real-estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>. Sarah Schoeneman of Mendo Real Estate has the listing.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Ralph Winter </div><div>729 words</div><div>23 August 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rental fundamentals are strong, leading management of <span class="companylink">Associated Estates Realty Corp</span>. to feel confident about its strategy of developing and purchasing additional apartments, said Jeffrey I. Friedman, president and chief executive officer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The REIT's apartments are practically all rented and tenants are paying higher rents, Mr. Friedman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aided by good cost control, he said, AEC expects an about 20% rise in 2012 per share funds from operations, the industry's preferred gauge of profitability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Friedman repeated an estimate that the REIT will produce funds from operations of $1.23 to $1.25 a share for all of 2012, up from $1.03 a share in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2012 estimate excludes three cents a share of charges for early repayment of debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The REIT sold 6,325,000 shares through a public offering in June and an additional 681,178 shares in the second quarter through an "At-the-Market" program, Mr. Friedman said, a common device in the REIT industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total proceeds of $98.3 million were used to reduce debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts were critical of the expansion plans and sale of stock below per share net asset value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some suggested the REIT was overreaching in moving into several new markets, and were especially critical of a plan to develop 175 luxury apartments in Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent Raymond James report called management's plan "a scattered growth strategy" that holds down the AEC stock price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Friedman strongly disagrees with that characterization, insisting that AEC "is following a well thought out strategic plan."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That plan involves diversification into promising new markets, he said, and selling older buildings while buying newer ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Associated Estates develops new properties only when low building costs permit the REIT to build more cheaply than buy, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"One of the reasons we made it through 2008 and 2009 unscathed, without having to cut our dividend was because we stuck with our strategic plan," Mr. Friedman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The REIT has a 97% occupancy rate, he said, about as high an occupancy as can be achieved as renters leave and are replaced. "We're not offering concessions anywhere," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New tenants pay 5.4% higher rent than the departing tenant paid, he said, and rents on renewals are 5.2% higher than for the expiring lease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That trend appears to be continuing, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Associated Estates owns 53 properties with a total of 14,114 units, he said, including a property in North Carolina where the transaction will close soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The REIT just completed developing a 242-unit project in Nashville and is building 99 apartments to expand a property in North Dallas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction will begin this quarter on a high-end, 140-unit property in Bethesda, Md., Mr. Friedman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next year AEC will begin construction of a 275-unit project in Dallas, he said, and 175 units in Los Angeles on "a great piece of property."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those five projects will cost an estimated $235 million, he said, including $36 million already spent. This is a good time to build, he said. "The construction trades want work; it is still a buyer's market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The REIT also this year bought or committed to buy $180 million of existing properties. Purchases in all of 2012 could total as much as $250 million, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Possible tax changes after the November elections are motivating some owners to sell this year, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The REIT this year sold four properties in western Michigan and one in Duluth, Ga., receiving $60 million for 1,192 apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average age of those properties was 26 years, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction, purchases and sales all will contribute to a more diversified, newer and better balanced portfolio, Mr. Friedman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Midwest units produce 38% of the REIT's net operating income, he said, mid-Atlantic units 32%, Southeast properties 25% and Dallas 5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Until 1998 we were 100% in the Midwest," he said, and as recently as 2005 about 75% of net operating income came from the Midwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Directors last March increased the dividend to an annual rate of 72 cents, he said, which is within the REIT's comfort range of 65% to 70% of generated cash.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of U.S. workers filing applications for jobless benefits rose for the second straight week, a sign that the labor market, though improved since the spring, remains uneven.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, sales of newly built homes in the U.S. rose in July, the third increase in the past four months, showing that the housing market is continuing its slow recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial jobless claims, an indication of layoffs, increased by 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 372,000 in the week ended Aug. 18, the Labor Department said Thursday. That's the highest level in about a month. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast 365,000 new applications for jobless benefits last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Claims for the week ending Aug. 11 were revised up to 368,000 from an initially reported 366,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four-week moving average of claims, which smooths out often choppy weekly data, climbed by 3,750 to 368,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Labor Department official said there were no unusual factors in Thursday's report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jobless claims data have stabilized in recent weeks, and the broad trend appears to have improved since June, when claims ranged around 385,000 a week. Claims averaged about 366,000 a week in July and are around 368,000 a week so far this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typically job creation increases when layoffs decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far this year, hiring has been fitful. A separate Labor Department report out early this month showed that the economy added 163,000 jobs in July, the biggest monthly gain since February and a welcome relief after weak reports for May and June. But the politically important unemployment rate ticked up to 8.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Policy makers at the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> are closely monitoring the employment situation as they weigh another round of stimulus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In minutes of their latest meeting, released Wednesday, officials signaled that they are readying new measures to boost the recovery unless data point to "a substantial and sustainable" pickup in growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed's policy makers next meet formally on Sept. 12 and 13.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's Labor data showed the number of continuing unemployment benefit claims--those drawn by workers for more than a week--increased by 4,000 to 3,317,000 in the week ended Aug. 11. Continuing claims are reported with a one-week lag.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of workers requesting unemployment insurance was equivalent to 2.6% of employed workers paying into the system in the week ended Aug. 11, unchanged from the prior week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-Home Sales Gain</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New single-family home sales increased by 3.6% last month from June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 372,000, the Commerce Department said Thursday. The rate matched May's level, which was the best since April 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales were up 25.3% compared to the same month a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results beat expectations. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast an annual sales rate of 360,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">June's sales rate was revised up to 359,000 from a previously reported 350,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">July's gain continues momentum for new home sales after a downturn in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously occupied properties also bounced back last month. Existing home sales increased 2.3% in July, a fairly modest improvement from June, which was the worst month of 2012, according to a <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> report released Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, prospective homeowners face tightened credit restrictions that make it hard to secure record-low mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales peaked in July 2005, when they hit an annual pace of nearly 1.4 million, and declined sharply in the run up to the financial crisis. Last year's level of 306,000 sales was the lowest on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce report showed the median price for a new home in July was $224,200, a 2.5% decrease from the same month a year ago. July's median price was the lowest since January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of new homes listed for sale, seasonally adjusted, at the end of July was 142,000. That's the lowest level on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply would take 4.6 months to deplete at the current sales pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">July's new-home sales were mixed in four U.S. regions. Sales grew 76.5% in the Northeast and 7.7% in the Midwest, but fell 1.6% in the South and 0.9% in the West.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Daniel Inman  </div><div>541 words</div><div>23 August 2012</div><div>06:50</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asian markets ended higher on Thursday as hopes for stimulus out of the U.S. outweighed gloomy manufacturing data from China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's most recent meeting showed many members of its policy-setting committee favoring more stimulus if there is no recovery in economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The minutes were "a reasonably strong statement that they are thinking about QE [Quantitative Easing] and that they are thinking of doing it this year," said Joe Bracken, head of macro strategies at <span class="companylink">BT Investment Management</span> in Australia, which has $36 billion in assets under management. "It was surprising on the positive side, because the market had discounted the Fed launching anything."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markets stumbled during the session when <span class="companylink">HSBC</span>'s preliminary purchasing managers index for August came in at 47.8, a nine-month lower, down from a final reading of 49.3 in July. A score below 50 suggests a contraction in manufacturing activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most markets initially weakened on the data, though they soon picked up as hopes for quantitative easing again took hold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Investors knew that China's economy was slowing and shrugged off the PMI data after a while," said Zheng Ping, an analyst at Minsheng Securities in China. "They started to pin their hopes on possible government intervention in China and abroad."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One market that didn't recover well after the data was Australia, which is particularly sensitive to Chinese economic data. The S&amp;P ASX 200 gained just 0.2% to 4383.7.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local earnings reports moved some stocks: <span class="companylink">Fortescue Metals Group</span> gained 2.2% after its earnings met expectations, while Qantas Airways added 2.6% as the market was impressed by the company's underlying profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Australian dollar strengthened against its U.S. counterpart on the easing hopes—to $1.0518, from $1.0439 late on Wednesday. The U.S. dollar also lost ground against the South Korean won, at 1,130 to the dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most significant currency action, though, was between the dollar and the yen. The greenback weakened 0.9% overnight, stabilizing at ¥78.62. When the Fed attempts to push down U.S. bond yields, it reduces the incentive to hold dollars rather than yen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stronger yen initially weighed on the Nikkei, but the market turned positive to finish the day up 0.5% at 9178.12. South Korea's Kospi was up 0.4% at 1942.54.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with easing hopes, corporate earnings took center stage in Hong Kong, where the Hang Seng Index rose 1.2% to 20132.24. Local developers gained following strong first-half earnings reports, with <span class="companylink">Henderson Land Development</span> and Wharf (Holdings) both advancing 4.7%. In mainland China, the Shanghai Composite ended 0.3% higher at 2113.07.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Vietnam, the Ho Chi Minh Index lost 4.2%, as investor confidence plunged with the arrest of another major banking figure: Police in Ho Chi Minh City detained Ly Xuan Hai of Asia Commercial Bank; earlier this week tycoon Nguyen Duc Kien, was arrested. Banks were hit particularly hard: Military Bank lost 4.3% and <span class="companylink">Sacombank</span> and Eximbank both finished 4.8% lower.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously occupied homes in the U.S. were up slightly in July from a month earlier and were more than 10% above the year before, a sign of strength for a part of the economy that is starting to recover from a severe downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales increased 2.3% in July from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.47 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Wednesday. The month's sales were 10.4% above the same month a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase, which was below analysts' forecasts, "suggests that the ongoing housing recovery continues to run at a gradual pace," Gennadiy Goldberg, an interest-rate strategist with <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span>, wrote in a note to clients. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had expected home sales to rise by 3% to an annual rate of 4.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sale price in July was $187,300, up 9.4% from a year earlier and the strongest year-over year gain since January 2006. Recent price increases, however, are largely attributable to a drop in the number of lower-priced homes sold as fewer foreclosures are put on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a bust that lasted about six years, the housing market has been turning around, with sales and prices stabilizing. Last week, analysts at <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span><span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span> revised upward their housing-market forecast, projecting home prices at the end of this year to be 2.2% above last year, against an earlier estimate of a 0.5% increase.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Craig Karmin </div><div>815 words</div><div>22 August 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As big institutional investors pull back from investing in high-risk real-estate funds, these funds are turning to a new source for capital: rich people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Starwood Capital Group</span>, <span class="companylink">Lone Star Funds</span>, <span class="companylink">Carlyle Group</span> and others have raised billions of dollars over the past several months from wealthy individuals seeking to get in on the firms' newest "opportunity" funds, which buy or develop riskier properties and use higher levels of debt in hopes of reaping high returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traditional investors in opportunity funds -- public and corporate pensions, foundations and endowments -- reduced their allocations to the funds or began avoiding them altogether after the funds racked up huge losses during the real-estate downturn that started in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In their place, you've seen high-net-worth investors," said Barry Sternlicht, chairman and chief executive of Starwood Capital. While pensions and other large investors can require a lengthy review period before their boards approve any new investment, wealthy individuals are appealing in part because they can act quickly. "They are very fast, flexible and intuitive," Mr. Sternlicht said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sternlicht declined to discuss details of his firm's fundraising. But people who have spoken with Starwood officials about the latest opportunity fund said it raised about $800 million from high net-worth individuals. That accounted for about 40% of the total $2 billion raised, up significantly from its previous fund. Starwood's fund is targeting distressed properties and debt, and new construction, including a condo and hotel project near the Brooklyn Bridge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carlyle raised about 10% of its $2.3 billion fund from high-net-worth individuals, while Lone Star took in more than $1 billion of a $5.5 billion fund that closed last year from these investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span>, which has had no trouble attracting institutional money for its current real-estate fund, has turned to individuals to diversify the investor base. More than $1 billion of the $13 billion that <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> is expected to raise has come from high-net-worth individuals, said people who have spoken with <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> officials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate executives say the case for commercial-property investment is easy to make when compared to other investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bonds, for example, offer skimpy yields that range from about 1.8% for 10-year Treasury debt to around 3% for a corporate bond. The stock market has been volatile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, property prices are well below their highs, and many funds are targeting returns of about 15% or higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most individual investors didn't participate in the commercial-property bubble, so they haven't been as shell-shocked as pension funds have after it burst, noted Vincent Costantini, chief executive of Boston-based property investment and advisory firm Roseview. "They had been staying on the sidelines," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affluent individuals are contributing from around the world, with increasing participation from wealthy Asian families and businessmen, private-bank officials said. In the U.S., they range from young entrepreneurs with new windfalls to retirees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The growing prevalence of individuals investing in real estate has also been a boon for the private-bank divisions of <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co</span>., <span class="companylink">UBS AG</span>, <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> and other big banks. These banks funnel money from their private-bank clients to the funds, earning a generous referral fee of as much as 4%, which is paid by the client and the fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wealthy investors typically need to have a net worth of at least $5 million to invest in opportunity funds and must invest at least $250,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the banks are referring clients primarily to brand-name real-estate funds with multiyear track records of good performance. That means hundreds of first-time property funds looking for investors are essentially cut out of the action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultra-high-net-worth investors with Citi Private Bank, who typically have between $25 million and several billion dollars in assets, are interested in this product, said David Bailin, global head of managed investments. Citi partners with funds that can "source excellent transactions" and focus on primary markets like London and New York, he said. The sponsor needs to be reputable and also of "institutional quality."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drawing from wealthy individuals carries some risk. Individual investors are more likely than institutional investors to run into financial trouble that could cause them to renege on their commitments to inject promised capital. That is something that rarely happens with a pension fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some real-estate advisers say funds that rely too heavily on individual investors can have a harder time raising institutional money. Pensions and other big investors require more disclosure and regular reporting information than individual investors, and they like to invest alongside others that share their interests.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Winds May Be Shifting</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For China's Real Estate</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising house prices mean headwinds to China's growth are blowing less fiercely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On average, residential property prices in 70 major cities in July were up 0.14% from June. It was the second monthly increase after eight months of falling prices. Sales are also inching higher. The amount of floor space sold in July was up 14% from a year earlier, the first increase since the end of 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, a turnaround in real-estate sales isn't translating into new investment. New starts were down 30% in July from a year earlier, a sharper fall than in previous months. Land sales were down 9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With real-estate investment the mainstay of China's domestic demand, that helps explain why growth is tepid, and everyone from cement manufacturers to electrical-appliance retailers is having a hard time. Falling land sales also explains why local governments, which rely on such sales for around 35% of their revenue, have been slow to push the stimulus button.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Behind the scenes, though, there are signs that investment is starting to pick up, too. China Overseas Land &amp; Investment, one of the country's largest developers, has adjusted its sales target for the year to 100 billion Hong Kong dollars ($12.89 billion), up from HK$80 billion. Du Jinsong, China real-estate analyst at <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>, says many developers are planning to accelerate new starts to meet stronger demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are also signs of recovery in land sales. The premium that developers pay over the starting price at land auctions has been on the rise, from a low of 1% in February to 11% in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't expect a surge in land transactions. Christie Ju, real-estate analyst at Jefferies, says years of unused land bank means developers will remain cautious. But rising competition means there is hope that land sales in the second half of the year will at least be stronger than in the first half.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A livelier land market will mean local governments have more to spend. Stronger construction should start to feed through into orders for China's industrial sector, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both sectors are rebounding from a low base. But China's government will hope that a headwind to growth in the first half will be turning to a tailwind for stabilization in the second.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Tom Orlik</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Risks for Capital Spending</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To look at the woeful earnings season that's wrapping up, the days of capital expenditure bolstering the U.S. economy seem numbered. But don't count it out yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">S&amp;P 500 earnings likely increased by just 0.9% in the second quarter versus a year earlier, according to S&amp;P Capital IQ's latest estimates. For the third quarter, analysts are forecasting the first outright decline in profits since 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending on new equipment and software is usually a function of demand: Whatever direction earnings growth is going is where capital spending will head within the next quarter or so. Profits began to seriously weaken in mid-2007, for example, and by early 2008 capital spending had begun to shrink. So even though spending on equipment and software grew at a healthy 7.2% inflation-adjusted annual rate in the second quarter, according to the Commerce Department, its future pace is in doubt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Europe's downturn and Asia's slowdown explain much of the weak growth in U.S. company earnings. So the dynamic isn't the same as it was in the last recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the second-quarter survey of chief financial officers he conducted with CFO Magazine, Duke Fuqua School of Business economist John Graham found stark differences in the capital-spending plans of U.S. firms booking most of their sales overseas and those with more domestic exposure. CFOs at companies booking more than half their sales in Europe expected spending to fall by about 5% over the next year. Companies with less than half their sales in Europe expected spending to increase by about 10%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. exports are substantial, but the bulk of foreign sales by U.S. companies come from the operations they have in place overseas. For example, the Pepsi sold in India is made in India. U.S. Trust chief market strategist Joseph Quinlan estimates that such sales came to more than $6 trillion last year. That compares with U.S. exports of just over $2 trillion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That matters because just as overall profits dictate how much money companies spend, they tend to spend it in places where they are doing well. The fact that <span class="companylink">General Motors</span>' European operations are struggling, for instance, didn't stop it from renovating and restarting production at its former Saturn assembly plant in Spring Hill, Tenn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there is a risk to capital spending in the U.S., it is less what profits have been and more what would happen if Congress can't prevent the $1.2 trillion in automatic spending cuts scheduled to start in January. Given how reliant many equipment and software firms are on defense and other government spending, that's a potent threat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Justin Lahart</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ECB: Europe's Conditional Bank</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another day, another gain in Spain. But are investors in the country's rallying government bonds getting carried away about <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> bond purchases?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The assumption is that the ECB will buy bonds, and the euro-zone crisis debate seems increasingly centered on the finer details of how such bond buying might actually work. Spanish Finance Minister Luis de Guindos has called for the ECB to commit to big purchases even before Spain asks for aid. Der Spiegel magazine in Germany has resurrected the debate about the ECB capping yields for struggling euro-zone states. But there is no such thing as a free lunch. Both of these ideas fail to take account of a key ECB requirement: conditionality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is surprising. After all, the one thing the ECB has been explicit about is that any intervention will come with strings attached. President Mario Draghi has made clear that before the ECB will buy a country's bonds, its government must first apply to the euro-zone bailout facilities for aid. Mr. Draghi has said that even then, purchases of short-term debt might not be automatic: An application for aid is a necessary but not sufficient condition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conditionality is a particularly vexing issue for the ECB. In October 2010, after the <span class="companylink">central bank</span>'s first foray into bond buying, politicians moved from ruling out a euro-zone debt default to arguing that private-sector creditors could be required to take losses if countries asked for aid. That led to the debacle in which the ECB refused to take losses on the Greek bonds it had purchased, and other investors suffered even greater losses as a result. Then, in 2011, governments in Italy and Spain quickly backpedaled on overhauls after ECB purchases started. ECB executive board member Joerg Asmussen warned Monday that this mistake must not be repeated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So Mr. de Guindos's call for an open-ended commitment looks like a nonstarter. If that were made, it would be almost impossible to force Spain to reform as the threat of the ECB discontinuing its purchases would be hollow. That leaves the ECB with a challenge. The idea of conditionality looks difficult to square with yield caps or any other form of fixed target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, conditionality isn't a happy partner for monetary policy, the banner under which the ECB has said bond purchases are possible. It pushes the unelected ECB even deeper into the political arena. And it raises the question of what the ECB would do if, once purchases have started, a country fails politically or economically to achieve its targets. For if conditionality is to mean anything at all, there must be consequences for failure.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK—U.S. stocks took a pause, with the Dow industrials ticking down for the first time in three sessions, as telecommunications and consumer-discretionary shares fell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up 3.56 points, or less than 0.1%, to 13271.64. The blue-chip benchmark had capped its sixth-straight weekly advance on Friday, putting it within striking distance of multiyear highs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index shed 0.03 point, or less than 0.1%, to 1418.13. <span class="companylink">Best Buy</span> tumbled 10%, its biggest decline since December, as buyout talks with founder Richard Schulze deteriorated and the company named Hubert Joly, the head of hospitality and restaurant giant Carlson, its chief executive. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.38 point, or less than 0.1%, to 3076.21.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The markets may be a little bit tired--obviously we closed at near four-year highs for the S&amp;P and the Dow Friday," said Ryan Larson, head of equity trading at RBC Global Asset Management. "Markets run, and they take a few breathers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European markets slipped, with the Stoxx Europe 600 down 0.5%, after the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> played down reports it was preparing to intervene in sovereign-debt markets. A spokesman for the central bank said a weekend report about such plans in German news magazine Der Spiegel was "absolutely misleading."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spain's IBEX-35 stock index, which had gained on the Der Spiegel report, reversed and was down 1.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There have to be some real long-term structural changes in how Europe attacks debt and growth," said Ernie Cecilia, chief investment officer at <span class="companylink">Bryn Mawr Trust Co</span>., which manages more than $6 billion in assets. "Everything we've observed so far hasn't supported that there's the political will to do that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No major domestic economic data were scheduled for release.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In corporate news, shares of <span class="companylink">Coventry Health Care</span> surged 20% after the company agreed to be acquired by <span class="companylink">Aetna</span> in a deal valued at $5.7 billion in cash and stock. <span class="companylink">Aetna</span> rose 5.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> dropped 5.8% after reporting disappointing quarterly results and issued a downbeat outlook for the full year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Facebook</span> reversed losses to rise 5%. Earlier, it touched an all-time intraday low of $18.75, less than half the social network's initial public offering price of $38. Traders said the stock's drop might have encouraged buyers. Meanwhile, Capstone Investments raised its stock-investment rating to "buy" from "hold."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Facebook</span> had stock plunged 10% over the previous two sessions after lockup agreements expired, making some 271 million additional shares eligible for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apple added 2.6%, giving it a market capitalization of more than $623.5 billion, the highest ever for a U.S. company. The former record holder, <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>, had a value of $616.3 billion in late 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere, Asian markets were mixed. China's Shanghai Composite slipped 0.4% after average housing prices rose in July, fueling worries that policy makers there will continue with measures to cool the property market. Japan's Nikkei Stock Average edged up 0.1% to a 3 1/2-month high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crude-oil futures lost less than 0.1% to settle at $95.97 a barrel, while gold futures added 0.2% to finish at $1,620.10 an ounce. The dollar lost ground against the euro and the yen. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 2/32 in price to yield 1.812%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ARNHEM, The Netherlands—The current front-runner in next month's Dutch general elections warned Sunday that a single-minded focus on austerity is crippling the country's economy and could unravel the euro zone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I can't say if we will be able to maintain the euro. The European economy is hurting too much from austerity," Emile Roemer told reporters at the launch of his Socialist Party's election campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Roemer's far-left party has benefited from growing voter resentment toward the German-led austerity drive and euro-zone bailouts. Some polls give it a clear lead over the Liberal Party of Prime Minister Mark Rutte.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Roemer blamed the current problems partly on flaws in the euro zone's design and said "technocrats" have gained power at the expense of voters. He said struggling countries in Southern Europe should be allowed more leeway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Europe should be about people, not about multinationals and the financial sector," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rutte's minority government collapsed in April after talks on new austerity measures fell apart. An interim coalition government agreed on a package to reduce the budget deficit to below a European Union-prescribed limit of 3% of gross domestic product in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Polls show Dutch voters—frustrated with austerity and wary of bailing out Southern European governments—may reject the package.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Socialist Party, which didn't support the austerity plan, would win the most seats in the 150-member Parliament, about 36, or four more than Mr. Rutte's Liberals, a poll released Sunday by website Peil.nl showed. A week earlier, the Socialists had a lead of six seats, according to Peil.nl.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Netherlands is still widely considered one of the stronger economies in the euro zone, with low unemployment and a decadelong track record of fiscal prudence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the EU expects the country to be one of the region's weakest performers this year, as spending cuts and a property slump squeeze domestic demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Socialist Party doesn't reject the EU budget rules, but wants two more years' time to implement them. "We will make different choices," said Mr. Roemer said. "It's not the pace of austerity that matters, but the quality."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a bid to revive the economy, Mr. Roemer wants to increase spending on infrastructure and schools. He also seeks to reverse a planned increase in the retirement age, raise the minimum wage, and undo spending cuts in social security and health care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Roemer, a former elementary-school teacher, has become popular because of such clear-cut language and his often cheerful, informal demeanor. But critics say his election promises could spell trouble for public finances. Finance Minister Jan Kees de Jager, a vocal advocate of budgetary discipline, said last week that Mr. Roemer's comments are causing unease in financial markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Netherlands is currently in the midst of a property downturn that shows some similarities to—if not the severity of—the one that has pushed Spain into a deep economic crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A housing and property boom in the 1990s and 2000s that was fueled by cheap credit has come to an abrupt end, resulting in falling house prices and a sharp contraction in the construction sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slump is hurting consumer sentiment, as many households have started saving more to pay off their mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the country's major banks last week reported rising bad loans, both on mortgages and commercial property. The local banking regulator has warned that a deepening downturn in the property markets could aggravate the problem.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK—Treasurys slumped for the fourth-straight session as investors lifted yields to their highest levels in more than three months to better reflect the slow-but-progressing economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With euro-zone developments quiet, the focus has been on U.S. conditions and the possibility of more monetary stimulus from the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>. Not all economic releases have been positive, but the trend is one of gradual improvement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors are increasingly convinced that the housing market has found a bottom: A report Thursday morning showed housing starts slipping in July, but new permits rising to the highest level since August 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report showed weekly jobless claims rising, though the smoother indication from its four-week moving average fell to its lowest level since the end of March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Encouraging data, along with the Fed's own wait-and-see approach, have somewhat deflated expectations that the central bank will deliver another bond-buying stimulus program at its September policy meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Fed hasn't come out to make a bold statement about what they're going to do, and that has really dampened expectations they'll do anything at all," said Joe Burke, interest-rate risk manager at Interactive Brokers Timber Hill Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Burke isn't convinced of the recent optimism surrounding U.S. data, pointing to discouraging manufacturing reports. He believes the 10-year yield will reverse lower and test the 1.4% lows reached just three weeks ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Philadelphia Fed published its business index Thursday, showing another month of contraction in the mid-Atlantic region's manufacturing activity. This followed a sharp drop reported Wednesday in a similar survey conducted for the New York region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The safe-haven market enjoyed only brief support from the discouraging report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By late-afternoon trading, those gains had evaporated. Benchmark 10-year notes lost 10/32 in price to yield 1.842% after touching a three-month high of 1.861%. The 30-year bond shed 29/32 to yield 2.960%. Bond yields rise when prices fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bond analysts expect 10-year yields to hug the 1.80% level, a point they say looks to be the new fork in the road as investors gauge U.S. economic conditions and tweak expectations for additional easing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed's policy-setting committee meets next on Sept. 12-13, when many market watchers had anticipated the central bank to deliver another cheap-money initiative to support growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two Fed members, known for their vigilance on inflation, told The Wall Street Journal that they question the good more bond-buying would do for the economy. Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser called the potential move "dubious," while Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher said recent economic data show no urgent need for action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the Fed's next move still up in the air, plenty of attention will be placed on the central bank's annual Jackson Hole, Wyo., symposium at the end of the month. It was here two years ago that Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke gave off a clear signal that the second round of quantitative easing was on its way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This wait-and-see mode, of course, only holds barring fresh headlines out of Europe. News about the region's ongoing debt crisis has been fairly quiet this month, allowing investors to focus on economic progress in the U.S.</p>
