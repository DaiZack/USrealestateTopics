<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Easing Apartment Pain; Sale Prices in Manhattan Are Lowest Since 2004, After Adjusting for Inflation</span>
</div><div class="author">By Josh Barbanel   </div><div>888 words</div><div>31 January 2013</div><div>00:06</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To live in Manhattan is to believe that never before have apartment prices been so expensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a new 10-year review of trends in apartment prices raises a few questions and footnotes over the rights to brag and moan about the high cost of getting a place to live in Manhattan: The median apartment price in 2012 was $835,000, but adjusted for inflation, it was the lowest since 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That figure, the result of roughly flat prices in Manhattan since the collapse of the housing market in 2008, shows that despite some marquee sales to billionaires at home and abroad, overall apartment prices may not be quite so bad as they seem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, some Manhattan brokers are now warning of listing shortages and potential price increases this year, as the inventory of co-ops and condominiums on the market are at the lowest level in a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But moans and groans about the high costs of Manhattan apartments are nothing new. A 1916 <span class="companylink">New York Times</span> article titled "Great Scarcity in Apartments" said that "never before has there been such a scarcity of apartments on Manhattan Island."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The review of sales in the last decade being released on Thursday by <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> showed that both median and average prices in Manhattan were off slightly last year from 2011, with average price close to $1.42 million in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But adjusting figures cited in the report for inflation, showed deeper declines. The median price for a two-bedroom apartment of $1.26 million in 2012 was the lowest since 2004 in constant dollars, as was the $385,000 for a studio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a three-bedroom apartment of $2.37 million was the lowest in more than a decade, while the median price of a four-bedroom apartment of $4.75 million was the lowest in nine years. Only one-bedrooms, with a median price of $650,000, were higher than the previous year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan Miller, an appraiser and president of Miller Samuel Inc., said that when prices were adjusted for inflation, the result "isn't in sync" with "the consumer perception" of what is happening in the market. Mr. Miller prepared the report for <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he said such misperceptions and complaints about shortages and high prices have been staples of the Manhattan real-estate market for 100 years. In the 1920s, he said, there were reports of an influx of international buyers and the importance of Wall Street to the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My takeaway," he said, is that over generations, "everybody thinks it is probably more expensive than it is."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tiffany Pratt, who is shopping for a scarce one-bedroom apartment for her son, a private tutor, on the far Upper East Side or in East Harlem, begs to differ. "I think that prices are very high and I think they always were," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Pratt, a real-estate broker in Westchester and Dutchess counties, once owned a large two-bedroom co-op in the East 80s. She sold it for prices far below asking prices on small one-bedroom apartments now. "It makes me sad. I could never afford to buy it today, and I am in much better financial shape now," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her broker, Malcolm Carter, said that people have been complaining about real-estate prices since he first moved to New York in 1970. "Complaints about prices are as endemic as complaints about taxi fares, subway service and strollers on the Upper West Side," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What makes these complaints about high prices more poignant is that many people live side by side with someone who paid a lot less than current prices for something similar, as Manhattan has passed through boom and bust cycles</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, just about everyone who either lives in Manhattan, or who couldn't afford to move there, knows someone who bought at the bottom. In the mid-1970s, townhouses and park-view co-ops now worth millions often sold for under $100,000 or sometimes far less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices tumbled again in the late 1980s and early 1990s and didn't bounce back for many years. New York's last real-estate boom began later than the bubble in the rest of the country, and lasted longer, until 2008, kept aloft by Wall Street bonuses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dolly Lenz, a top broker at <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>, said that at the luxury end of the market, prices were simultaneously "cheap" and "absolutely undoubtedly at a peak," whatever the market reports say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said international buyers, who are familiar with the more-expensive markets in London and Hong Kong, "look at property in New York and think it is cheap."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, she said, "compared with the rest of the U.S., New York seems absurdly expensive, on a price per-square-foot basis or on almost any other metric."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller said the market may be stronger now than it was during the boom years, when prices were higher. He said during the real-estate boom, sales were driven up by "artful credit conditions, but now with tight credit, "prices are more real."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jim Carlton </div><div>874 words</div><div>31 January 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A11A</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bay Area housing market roared out of the doldrums in 2012 as prices climbed nearly everywhere in the region -- in some cases by almost 40% -- amid Silicon Valley's continuing technology strength and a national economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median prices for existing single-family detached homes rose in all but eight of 107 cities or communities in the Bay Area during the fourth quarter, compared with a year earlier, according to <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>, a real-estate data firm. The city of Guerneville jumped the most, by 38.4%, while prices rose 35% in Oakland, 28.3% in San Francisco and 21.2% in San Jose, according to the <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> analysis of completed sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the laggards, Stinson Beach prices dropped 63.9%, Atherton was down 9.7% and Sausalito declined 5.1% in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> analyst Andrew LePage noted that wide swings are partially attributable to a shifting mix of homes sold during the quarter, such as more or fewer high-price ones, that can affect the median price. He adds that prices generally rebounded almost everywhere in the Bay Area, in contrast to 2011 when a similar <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> analysis showed that less than a third of the region's cities or communities had returned to price increases after the recession ended in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, the Bay Area's 24% surge in median prices in the fourth quarter to $465,000 from $375,000 a year earlier led both the state's 22.9% increase to $295,000 and the nation's 9.7% rise to $192,000 last year, according to <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is the gradual housing-market recovery we should expect [in the Bay Area] as the economy builds steam and more people find work, while fewer people are losing jobs," says Mr. LePage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A key driver of the Bay Area's housing recovery last year was an expansion of the Silicon Valley tech boom to cities such as San Francisco, real-estate brokers say. The influx of workers into the city's social-media industry has helped spur a return to bidding wars that sometimes result in offers well above the asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A one-bedroom, one-bath condominium in San Francisco's Noe Valley neighborhood, for instance, was listed for $699,000 last summer and sold for $851,000 in an all-cash offer made by an employee of a social-media firm, says Paul Barbagelata, broker-owner of Barbagelata Real Estate, which represented the seller. "Our gold rush right now is in social media," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Barbagelata's firm also represented the buyer and seller of a three-bedroom, two-bathroom property that went for more than the asking price in November in San Francisco's upscale St. Francis Wood area. The home, which needed updating, was listed for $1.19 million and sold for $1.38 million after the seller received 11 offers, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, multiple offers and above-asking prices have become the norm throughout the Bay Area, at least for entry-level and midrange homes generally below $1 million, real-estate brokers say. That is making for some happy sellers. "It was a beautiful thing," Dan Whalen, 53 years old, a financial executive from Seattle and executor of the Noe Valley home left by the death of an uncle, says of his family's windfall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market has become tougher for buyers, however. Cindy Foreman, a <span class="companylink">Keller Williams Realty</span> agent in Danville, says traditional buyers like a young couple seeking their first home are being outbid by investors who often offer all cash. "It's almost impossible for an entry-level buyer to compete," Ms. Foreman says, before driving to a for-sale home that fetched multiple offers in San Ramon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Duncan last week submitted his fourth offer in two months for a home in the Martinez area after relocating to the Bay Area from Minneapolis last year for his job as category manager with a consumer-products company. "I thought it was still a buyer's market, but it turned into a seller's market," says the 29-year-old, whose latest offer, for an unspecified amount over the home's asking price, was accepted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Duncan's real-estate agent, Jennifer Larson, advised him and other buyers to include personal letters with their offers. "You have to do what you can to stand out," says Ms. Larson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Writing a personal letter helped newlyweds Jeff and Carly Reab stand out. They won a bidding war with 18 other potential buyers in December for a three-bedroom, two-bathroom home in Rohnert Park, says their agent, Rebecca Celli. Ms. Reab, 30, a construction project engineer, says they paid $420,000, 17% above the list price of $360,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We said we would like to have a family, be in a safe neighborhood and maybe have something we can pass down to our children," Ms. Reab says. "We had to tug at the heartstrings."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SINGAPORE -- An increased surcharge the Singaporean government has assessed on most foreign buyers to try to tamp down soaring property prices threatens to rattle Singapore's uneasy relationship with many of its rich foreigners while giving Americans an edge in one of Asia's hottest property markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This month, the government boosted to 15% from 10% the fee added to the purchase price of residential property bought by many foreign nationals, including the Chinese, who were the second-largest group of foreign buyers last year. In contrast, U.S. buyers don't have to pay the surcharge, thanks to a bilateral trade accord with Singapore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joy Stevenson, a U.S. native who has lived in the city-state for more than 20 years with her family, bought a two-bedroom condominium this month in a neighborhood close to the Singapore Botanic Gardens for 1.85 million Singapore dollars (US$1.5 million). Under the new 15% stamp duty, a Chinese or Indonesian buyer would have paid US$1.725 million for the same property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. citizens are exempt from paying the fee because of a nine-year-old trade pact that requires U.S. investors to be treated the same as Singaporeans. A few other nationalities get the same perk -- citizens of Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein -- but most don't, including citizens of Indonesia and Malaysia, countries that in other respects enjoy close economic ties with Singapore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Singapore's government imposed the tax in December 2011 on most foreigners to fight what it contends is excessive speculation in the property market. Private-home prices have surged 59% since the market's most recent trough in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government worries that foreign buying is introducing the risk of a market bubble and making homes less affordable for Singaporeans, which is feeding a growing resentment of foreigners. But the move risks alienating some wealthy foreigners, including the Chinese, whose home-buying activity dropped markedly last year after the government imposed the original 10% surcharge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My feeling is that Singapore isn't foreigner-friendly anymore," said Alan Chen, 37 years old, who is from Shanghai and moved to Singapore five years ago to work in the logistics industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Chen is a Singapore permanent resident, a legal status that confers certain advantages denied to other foreigners, such as the ability to buy single-family homes and receive higher priority in school admissions. They also had escaped the stamp duty paid by foreigners, but now will have to pay a 5% fee when purchasing their first home. That changes the equation for the legions of expatriates who call Singapore home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some property agents say they can feel a chill among permanent residents as a result of the 5% levy. "I had a couple of clients who now can't afford it," said Deborah Law, manager of property broker Expat Realtor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The revised Additional Buyer Stamp Duty measures are meant to moderate the demand for properties across all groups of buyers of properties, including Singapore citizens, Singapore permanent residents and foreigners," a statement provided by a Ministry of Finance official said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soaring home prices have fed public dissatisfaction as many Singaporeans watched prices climb out of their reach. Those feelings of discontent also are tied into a public backlash against the rising presence of foreigners. Cheap labor from places such as India and the Philippines is seen as pulling down wages for Singaporeans, even as property buying by wealthy foreigners pushes up home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's very expensive, probably due to the high demand from foreigners," Singaporean Kelvin Lee, 32, said of residential home prices. "These last few years, [the price of housing] has been rising too much, too fast."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lee, who works in financial services and hopes to buy a residence in the next few years, said the government's cooling measures "probably will calm things down so that more Singaporeans will be able to afford to buy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the higher tax on most foreign buyers, the government imposed other measures this month to keep prices in check. It raised the minimum down payment for people buying second homes and capped mortgage payments for people buying government-built housing at 30% of monthly income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private-home prices rose 2.8% in 2012, according to data from <span class="companylink">Singapore's Urban Redevelopment Authority</span>, compared with 5.9% in 2011. Foreign buying fell substantially in 2012, after the government's earlier round of cooling measures. Other factors may have contributed to the drop, such as some foreign investors believing Singapore's prices for residential property are unsustainable and better investment opportunities lie elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In particular, the buying of private homes by Chinese plunged 42% in 2012 from 2011, according to data from global property adviser Knight Frank. Chinese buyers slipped to the No. 2 spot last year, representing 22% of foreigners buying homes in Singapore, while Malaysians reclaimed the top spot with 26%. Indonesians were the third-largest group at about 19% of foreign buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American buyers are a much smaller group, comparatively, buying only 169 homes in 2012 to make up 2.4% of all foreign purchases. There are about 25,000 Americans living in Singapore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some U.S. buyers see opportunities. Suman Masciarelli, an American entrepreneur who with her husband Jason came to Singapore to start a mobile-app company called Acromobile, bought a home in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said she is considering selling some of her U.S. real estate in order to invest in other Singapore properties."We are looking at this market. It is quite high, but it seems like a very controlled market that won't have an overnight drop."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Conor Dougherty   </div><div>486 words</div><div>30 January 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing recovery continues to gain strength and breadth, helping to lift the economy at a time when overall growth remains sluggish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices rose 5.5% in November from a year ago, the strongest increase since the peak of the housing boom in August 2006, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller index, released Tuesday. A survey out Monday from <span class="companylink">Lender Processing Services Inc</span>., which tracks about 600 cities, showed home prices were up an average of 5.1% in November from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller report showed that 19 of the 20 metropolitan areas it tracks registered year-over-year price increases, with New York the sole city to see prices fall. The improvement has been considerable in much of the nation: 11 cities in the Case-Shiller index saw year-over-year price gains of 7% or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The West, which was hit hard by the housing bust, has been a standout. Phoenix home prices were up 22.8% year over year, the best performance in the nation. In San Francisco, where home prices have been pushed up by the technology sector, prices increased 12.7% from November 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices are rising after housing inventory fell precipitously over the past year. While much of this was driven by investors who buy homes in bulk and pay cash, the flurry of activity put a floor under prices and made regular consumers more confident about buying again -- a development helped by low interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists expect home prices to keep rising in 2013 because those two forces -- low interest rates and a slender inventory of homes for sale -- are expected to persist throughout the year. "We're not building enough at a high enough rate," said Patrick Newport, an economist at IHS Global Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite this lift, consumers' outlooks have dimmed as rising taxes and dysfunction in Washington have made Americans less optimistic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A gauge of consumer confidence tracked by the Conference Board fell 8.1 points in January, to 58.6. Consumer confidence has fallen for three months straight and is now at its lowest level since November of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pessimism was widespread: Consumers felt worse about their job and income prospects, and are adjusting some of their spending to match.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Confidence fell late last year, in part because of budget brinkmanship in Washington. While the federal government's fiscal concerns have been resolved for the time being, consumers saw their paychecks shrink with the expiration of the payroll-tax holiday at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report Tuesday by the Census Bureau showed that the percentage of Americans who owned their home fell to 65.4% at the end of last year from 65.5% in the third quarter of 2012.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Al Yoon </div><div>819 words</div><div>30 January 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new worry is threatening the rally in the rebounding market for commercial mortgage-backed securities: Property owners have started to pick up the pace of resolving problems with distressed loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is bad news for bondholders who paid up to buy such securities on the assumption they would keep paying a high interest rate for a longer period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This month, some investors have been hit with losses as their commercial-mortgage securities, or CMBS, that had been steadily rising in value for months went into reverse. For example, early this month investors were willing to pay as much as $116.13 for securities with a face value of $100, up from $100.81 in August 2011. Last week they were trading at $114.81.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Market participants blame the decrease largely on the rise in repayments. This risk is "not yet fully appreciated by the market," said Roger Lehman, head of securitized-products research at <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The CMBS market is watched closely in the commercial real-estate industry because the securities are an important source of finance. When the downturn hit in 2008, new CMBS issues practically vanished, contributing to the credit crisis in the industry and enormous headaches for landlords.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in recent years the market has rebounded. There were about $48 billion of new issues in 2012, and experts estimate volume will hit $65 billion this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the values of commercial-mortgage bonds issued during the boom years have risen. That mostly is because of the relatively high interest rates they carry. The interest rates of top U.S. government bonds have fallen below 2%, and investors have been willing to pay high prices for precrisis CMBS that carry rates of 5% or 6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until now, the biggest concern, as the market has rebounded, has been in the high delinquency rate. Many commercial properties still are suffering from high vacancy and low demand, and the resulting defaults have caused losses for some commercial-mortgage security investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But lately, the problem of repayments has caused problems especially for investors in the least-risky slices of the bonds. What is happening is that landlords have been taking advantage of dropping rates and easing loan conditions to refinance and pay off a growing volume of the CMBS debt that they borrowed at higher rates earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those moves by borrowers are hurting investors who bought bonds on the assumption that the pace of refinancing and repayments would be much slower. The repayment problem is focused primarily on the $69 billion or so of loans in the hands of distressed-debt specialists. Until recently, those bonds didn't face much risk from refinancing or repayment because they were troubled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're starting to see the thaw of the market, and distressed property loans you thought might be around for a while longer can now be resolved pretty quickly," said Gary Greenberg, a portfolio manager at <span class="companylink">Payden &amp; Rygel</span>. "It's great for commercial real estate, but it may not be the best thing for CMBS."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider, for example, the fate of a $470 million loan on Two California Plaza, a Los Angeles office tower whose low occupancy has long fostered worries of losses. The special servicer that has foreclosed on the property may now sell it sooner than expected. That means that investors who bought into a $7.5 billion CMBS issue from 2007 that includes the Two California Plaza loan, may soon get repaid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors are only now waking up to the prepayment risks as refinancing accelerates. About 80% of commercial-property loans that were scheduled to mature were prepaid or refinanced on schedule last quarter, double the rate from the first half of 2012 and the most since 2008, according to <span class="companylink">Amherst Securities Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Special servicers also are accelerating sales of properties as real-estate prices recover, and when modifying loans they often have lifted prepayment restrictions, according to Mr. Lehman. Of $47.3 billion in loan modifications tracked by <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>, at least 47% of those granted the borrower the ability to prepay the loan before maturity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surprise payoffs included a refinancing of a $90 million loan on 110 East 42nd St., an office and condominium property in Manhattan, about a year after modification and five years ahead of its new maturity, according to Harris Trifon, head of CMBS and asset-backed bond research at <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors in another CMBS this month learned that a $57.75 million loan on the City Crescent Building in Baltimore paid off ahead of schedule, returning 80% of the remaining principal on one of the most senior slices of the CMBS, Mr. Trifon said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Matthew Dolan </div><div>774 words</div><div>29 January 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DETROIT -- In a back office at the headquarters of mortgage company <span class="companylink">Quicken Loans Inc</span>., workers are assembling a 9-by-5-foot scale model of Detroit's modest downtown that will be used to plot the district's future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Down at street level, Chief Executive Dan Gilbert is already seeking to piece together that vision, buying up real estate along Woodward Avenue, the city's main commercial corridor, and cultivating a new crop of businesses in an attempt to create a self-sustaining mix of residential and commercial development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past decade or so, other Detroit boosters have had some success in similar efforts to rehabilitate the city's downtown district, which lost hundreds of businesses to suburban outposts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is Mr. Gilbert, who grew up outside the city and is worth an estimated $1.9 billion, who has put the biggest stamp on downtown lately, in both the size and scope of his investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the district is showing signs of progress, with new tech businesses, trendy stores and rehabbed apartments occupying some of the dilapidated towers along Woodward. Huge challenges remain, however, as fear of crime continues to deter many people from living downtown or retailers from setting up there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, one more part of Mr. Gilbert's plans fell into place: a $25 million federal grant for a $140 million, public-private light-rail line along Woodward that he and other business leaders backed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gilbert's investments "have accelerated our community and economic development plans by years," said Dave Blaszkiewicz, president of the Downtown Detroit Partnership, a group of business and government leaders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Gilbert says, a city that lost 25% of its residents in the past decade, to about 710,000, needs even more robust efforts to draw people and business. "It can't be just us," the 51-year-old said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the early 2000s, companies such as <span class="companylink">General Motors Co</span>., <span class="companylink">Compuware Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan</span> have moved thousands of workers downtown, spurred by special incentives offered by the city and the state, and by low rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Little Caesar's Pizza founder Mike Ilitch's Olympia Entertainment Group, meanwhile, has built or revived several entertainment venues and is now exploring building a $650 million entertainment district anchored by a new hockey arena.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2009, Mr. Gilbert, who also owns the National Basketball Association's <span class="companylink">Cleveland Cavaliers</span>, joined the trend, pledging to move his firm's headquarters from the suburbs to downtown, eventually bringing in more than 7,000 employees. Since then, his real-estate arm has bought 15 buildings, filling them with 65 new businesses, including Fathead, his own poster company, and an outpost of micro-blogging firm <span class="companylink">Twitter Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revitalization efforts by Mr. Gilbert and others haven't been universally welcomed. Several neighborhood leaders have expressed concern that resources poured into the central business district would be better spent on services, such as police and fire, on the city's outer reaches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rehabilitation plans face large obstacles. The streets still fall eerily quiet after commuters leave, and there are few retailers compared with suburban communities. While downtown is relatively safe, crime data put off many workers from lingering after hours. The city's crime rate fell 2.6% in 2012 from 2011, but homicides rose 9% to 411.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, City Hall has had worries about running out of money for more than a year. On Monday, chief financial officer Jack Martin said, "we anticipate no cash crisis over the next few months." But the city's finances are under a state review that could lead to the appointment of an emergency financial manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Gilbert says, he will seek to expand housing and shopping outlets this year to meet growing demand from his employees and other downtown residents, addressing a chicken-or-egg problem that has long bedeviled Detroit: not enough residents to support a retail infrastructure, and not enough retail to attract new residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate analysts say they are seeing a ripple effect from Mr. Gilbert's spree, as lower vacancy rates and rising rents draw other investors off the sidelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lansing, Mich., developer Richard Karp beat more than two dozen competitors to rehabilitate three buildings around downtown's Capitol Park, a $90 million project set to begin this summer. "Gilbert's investment in downtown added to our level of comfort," Mr. Karp said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Dawn Wotapka                And Saabira Chaudhuri   </div><div>704 words</div><div>29 January 2013</div><div>15:36</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">D.R. Horton Inc</span>. posted its strongest first-quarter results in six years, with profit more than doubling as the nation's largest home builder enjoyed double-digit percentage closings and order increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Horton stock rose sharply on the news, up more than 10% at midday on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results came amid a broader recovery for the U.S. home-building sector, which finally is recovering from the worst downturn in generations. Buyers feel confident enough to take advantage of depressed home prices and record-low mortgage rates, a combination that has made owning a home cheaper than renting in many markets. An estimated 367,000 new homes were sold in 2012, up 20% from 2011, according to the Commerce Department. Late Monday, builder <span class="companylink">Beazer Homes USA Inc</span>. said its first-quarter orders jumped 29% from the prior year, while closings increased nearly 20%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market for existing homes, which makes up the bulk of the nation's residential market, also is healing. On Monday, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> trade group reported that pending home sales, which reflect contracts to purchase homes, climbed 6.9% in December from the same month in 2011 and have risen for 20 consecutive months compared with a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, housing continues to face competition from the booming rental market, while tight mortgage-lending standards are keeping plenty of would-be buyers out of the for-sale market. Builders face increased prices for supplies, while competition for land is driving up prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Horton, based in Fort Worth, Texas, long has been a favorite with industry analysts because its management team avoids risk and it constructs lower-priced homes accessible to many buyers. It also runs a credit-repair program that broadens its buying pool to consumers with weaker credit, and it builds in many markets that some competitors overlook, such as Boise, Idaho, and Las Cruces, N.M. The company also is rolling out a higher-end business line in major markets across the nation, a move that comes as low mortgage rates allow many buyers to spend more on homes, while still keeping payments affordable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the quarter ended Dec. 31, Horton reported a profit of $66.3 million, or 20 cents a share, up from a year-earlier profit of $27.7 million, or nine cents a share. Home-building revenue jumped 39% to $1.23 billion, helped by geographic mix and larger average home size, the company said. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters most recently had forecast earnings, on average, of 14 cents a share on revenue of $1.1 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The builder, the nation's largest by annual closings, reported that closings increased 26% from a year earlier, while orders rose 39%. Closings and orders increased in the West, where homes are typically more expensive, and in the Southeast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average sales price climbed 15% to $249,900 when compared with the prior year. The cancellation rate was 22%, down from 26% a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The backlog of homes under contract rose 62% to 7,317 homes, and the value jumped 80% to $1.8 billion, indicating the company should see strong home-sales closings in the next few months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Horton saw its cash and cash equivalents fall to $546 million from about $1 billion in the prior quarter. While such spending could indicate weakness, the company painted the spending as a positive. "We significantly increased our investments in homes under construction, finished lots, land and land development to capture this increasing demand," Chairman Donald Horton said in a news release. "We are looking forward to the spring selling season with optimism."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a conference call with investors, executives said they expect the pace of land and lot purchases to moderate, while development spending will increase over the next few quarters.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing recovery is starting to show up in corporate results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies that sell power tools, air conditioners, carpet fibers, furniture and cement mixers are reporting stronger sales for the fourth quarter, providing further evidence that a turnaround in the housing market is taking hold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results add to data on home construction and pricing that indicate a bottom may have been reached after the sector's long slide. While the incoming data continue to be mixed, evidence that Americans are spending more to build and refurbish homes is raising executives' confidence that the housing market will continue to improve and help fuel the broader economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Honeywell International Inc</span>., which derives about 5% of its sales from the U.S. residential housing market, said sales of heating and cooling systems rose 6% in the fourth quarter compared with the year-earlier period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That is the first sign of life that we have had in a while, and that is a good sign," Honeywell Chief Financial Officer Dave Anderson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">United Technologies Corp</span>., which makes Carrier heating and cooling equipment, said orders of residential air-conditioning and heating products rose 20% in the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier, the fourth-straight quarter to notch a gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Housing is what we see leading the economy out of the doldrums," said Greg Hayes, chief financial officer of the industrial conglomerate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere, <span class="companylink">Oshkosh Corp</span>. said orders for its McNeilus cement mixers and JLG extended forklifts, both used for home building, rose in the last three months of 2012. <span class="companylink">DuPont Co</span>. said demand for its Sorona carpeting fiber was stronger during the quarter thanks in part to the housing recovery. And <span class="companylink">Stanley Black &amp; Decker Inc</span>. said sales of power-tool sales rose 5% last year, a sign that Americans are investing in home repair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results follow a string of encouraging data on the housing market last year. Sales of existing U.S. homes rose to their highest annual level in five years in 2012 and registered their largest annual jump since 2004, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. Home construction, meanwhile, rose 12% in December and finished the year with the most new homes started since 2008. For all of 2012, 780,000 new homes were started, a 28% increase from the year earlier. Remodeling activity is also showing improvement, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of <span class="companylink">Harvard University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That said, the sector is hardly out of the woods. The market hasn't worked through the overhang of depressed properties, and conservative lending standards at banks mean mortgages aren't always available to would-be buyers. It is also hard to tell how the sector will react when the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> eventually dials back its aggressive efforts to keep rates on home loans low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New data out of the Commerce Department disappointed markets Friday by showing a 7.3% drop in sales of new homes in December. While new-home sales finished the year up 20%, 2012 was the third-worst year for new-home sales on record dating back to 1963.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, executives at companies exposed to housing are growing more optimistic. Improvement in the sector could help broad tracts of the economy by creating jobs, improving consumer confidence and boosting property-tax receipts for municipalities. Construction typically is a big job creator during expansions, though the industry has been slow to staff up during the current recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing recovery will help lift businesses that have long been dormant," said Mark Vitner, senior economist at <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>. "People will be fixing up homes to put them up for sale—buying new air conditioners, painting, fixing roofs. As the new-home market picks up, that really feeds into [gross domestic product]."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daniel Oppenheim, a <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse AG</span> analyst based in New York, predicts that home-improvement spending will rise 7% this year and 8% in 2014. He also expects construction of new homes to rise, and predicts that USG, a Chicago-based maker of gypsum wallboard, will record its first profit in 2013 after five years of heavy losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As customers feel more confident in the value of their homes, they tend to make improvements and buy new furnishings," said Farooq Kathwari, chief executive officer of furniture maker <span class="companylink">Ethan Allen Interiors Inc</span>. But he cautioned that the economic recovery is still "fragile," which is likely to prevent some customers from splurging. Ethan Allen, based in Danbury, Conn., last week reported that earnings in the quarter ended Dec. 31 rose 22% from a year earlier to $9.8 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rail-freight operators are benefiting from the increased movement of furniture and supplies. <span class="companylink">Union Pacific Corp</span>., which posted a 7% rise in quarterly profit, said lumber shipments increased 17% as housing starts showed solid year-to-year improvement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the second half of this year, <span class="companylink">Union Pacific</span>'s business that transports goods by land, sea and air will be driven by furniture and "the things that you build housing with," said the railroad's marketing executive, Eric Butler.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At specialty truck maker Oshkosh, quarterly profit rose 20% at the end of 2012. Sales of the company's cement mixers rose 36% to $63 million in the quarter, while sales of its extended-reach forklifts—called telehandlers—increased 39% to $207 million. "We're seeing that come right up with the housing starts, which has been some good news," said Wilson Jones, Oshkosh's president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sounding a cautionary note, however, he said some of the company's smaller customers are still struggling. While sales of cement mixers have nearly doubled from the same quarter in 2010, Mr. Jones said the gains are coming from a low base, and that sales are still as much as 70% below their precrisis peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Executives also warn that the broader economic environment remains fragile, in part due to continued battling over the budget in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Just because the news looks a little better the last couple of weeks, we just don't think this is a good time to declare economic victory," Honeywell CEO David Cote said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto </div><div>1073 words</div><div>28 January 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A17</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two months after government officials struck a landmark deal with landlords to set aside 2,500 affordable units to house victims of superstorm Sandy, one apartment lease has been signed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of those displaced by the storm are too poor to pay rent even for apartments restricted to city residents with low or middle incomes, while others don't want to move far from their homes in the Rockaways or Staten Island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finding temporary housing for families has proved one of the biggest challenges in Sandy's aftermath: The city has a historically low rental-vacancy rate of about 3%, and there is little empty land to put up temporary trailers or build new housing. "It's a housing market, a rental market that is different than anywhere else in the country, in the world. It's presented a unique set of challenges for us," said Hannah Vick, a spokeswoman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials had once seen the vacant units as an important piece of the puzzle. Instead, New York and New Jersey announced a fourth extension of FEMA's hotel housing system, for two weeks, for nearly 2,000 households still living in hotels in New York and about 1,500 in New Jersey. The hotel program so far has cost about $50 million in New York and more than $24 million in New Jersey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hotel living is beginning to wear on people such as Mark McGregor, 38 years old, who is living with his wife and three children in the Park House Hotel in Borough Park, Brooklyn. His two-bedroom apartment in Queens' Howard Beach neighborhood was badly hit, and he said he didn't want to move back because living conditions were bad even before the storm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the city helped connect him with a couple of landlords willing to take people displaced by Sandy, but the so-called affordable apartments were too expensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They want like sky-high prices, $1,700, $1,800, $2,000. I'm not going to take that chance jumping out, paying the rent and then get stuck. I'd be right back to ground zero again," said Mr. McGregor, who added that he paid $1,375 in Howard Beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and his wife were both born in Brooklyn, and their two daughters attend school there, so he said he is hesitant to leave the borough. The city is helping him apply for public housing, but he is worried that it may be dangerous or far away from their former home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FEMA hotel program now expires on Feb. 9, but even if the state extends it again, federal officials said hotels aren't an acceptable alternative to providing interim housing in apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That is never a long-term solution for anyone's housing needs," Marty Bahamonde, a FEMA spokesman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, private landlords agreed to give priority to Sandy victims for hundreds of market-rate apartments. Since the process of renting these apartments was done privately, it is difficult to say how many Sandy victims found housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aid workers said few of those who remain displaced can afford market rents. "The folks who are having trouble getting out [of the hotels] are elderly, disabled, but many of them are low-income and isolated," said Ann Dibble, director of the storm-response unit at the <span class="companylink">New York Legal Assistance Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development has also tried to connect Sandy victims with about 2,500 vacant affordable apartment units, which typically rent for just over $900 for a one-bedroom. Officials said about 1,100 households applied for those units, and more than 800 were matched for interviews. One lease has been signed in the Bronx, but city officials said a couple of dozen leases could be signed in the next two weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials found that three-quarters of the families that applied had incomes below the level needed to qualify for affordable units. For instance, a family of four must have an income of about $25,700 or more to qualify. FEMA helps cover rent on a temporary basis, but landlords generally want to know that people can continue paying it once assistance expires, officials said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City officials are helping those families apply for public housing through the <span class="companylink">New York City Housing Authority</span>, but the waiting list for those units is often years, and it isn't clear whether Sandy victims would be able to jump the line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the affordable units that landlords made available are also located in northern Manhattan and the South Bronx, an upheaval for people whose friends, jobs, medical care and children's schools are located in Staten Island or the Rockaways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City officials said they can act as a matchmaker between displaced families and landlords but can't do much more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're here to provide guidance and to do the best we can to make that match and get interviews facilitated, but we can't force somebody to move and sign a lease; that's a decision each family has to make for themselves," a Department of Housing Preservation and Development spokesman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ron Moelis, a principal at L+M Development Partners, set aside about 170 affordable units primarily in northern Manhattan and the South Bronx for Sandy victims, but he said interest has been surprisingly low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've had very little success getting people to come up to the Bronx or Harlem. We've had a lot of calls, but people don't want to do it. They don't want to leave Staten Island or the Rockaways or wherever they were," Mr. Moelis said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, a building he recently purchased near Far Rockaway has proved a rare bright spot. Located by hard-hit areas, Ocean Village has units ranging from just over $700 a month for some studios to about $1,700 a month for a five-bedroom. At least five families displaced by Sandy could move in soon. "It's a testament to neighborhoods. New York is one city, but it's a lot of neighborhoods," he said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Carmel Melouney </div><div>910 words</div><div>28 January 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A20</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first building in <span class="companylink">Columbia University</span>'s 17-acre expansion, which is beginning to take shape in West Harlem, will be devoted to one of the biggest mysteries in science: the workings of the human brain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction crews are working on the foundation of a 450,000-square-foot building that will house the Mortimer B. Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute. When it opens in 2016, the institute hopes to become a world-class research and education center focusing on human behavior, diseases of the brain and other areas of neural science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project is the first of 15 new buildings planned in Columbia's new Manhattanville campus that is slated to cost $6.8 billion. Besides the brain institute, the first phase will also include a new home for the Lenfest Center for the Arts, which will contain an art gallery and performance space. Later phases include a new home for the Columbia Business School.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the new brain institute will be pioneering the latest ideas of how best to design interior space at a research center to produce great science. Columbia's existing science buildings "leave a little to be desired," says institute co-director Tom Jessell. "Not that they weren't great when they were first designed in 1925, but it's a different world now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project underscores the importance of New York's academic institutions to the growth of the city's economy. Projects like Columbia's expansion and the new Cornell University school for technology planned for Roosevelt Island will pump business into the city's construction industry while keeping New York on the cutting edge of medicine, science and technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it has been a tough slog for New York's educational institutions to carve out expansion space in a crowded city. Columbia was able to accumulate the land for its expansion only after decades of battles with community groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The university eased neighborhood concerns partly by agreeing to spend $76 million on programs supporting the community, as well as a Columbia-assisted public secondary school for math, science and engineering. "It was a very big deal and almost a miracle that it happened," says Columbia President Lee Bollinger, who hopes to create "a new campus for a new century."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the last 10 years, Columbia has been hoping to expand its expertise in neuroscience. The idea has been to create an institute that combines a wide range of fields that study the brain -- including mathematics, psychology, political science and the arts -- under one roof.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The effort got a big boost in December when Mortimer Zuckerman, a publisher and real-estate developer, pledged $200 million to endow the new institute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've been interested in the mind and the brain for a long time," says Mr. Zuckerman. He said his interest grew after he met Eric Kandel, a Columbia professor who won the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 2000 for his work on memory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I know him, I like him, and we had been at dinner parties together. Then I spent three hours in his lab and I was just blown away," Mr. Zuckerman says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Institute officials say that Mr. Zuckerman's gift will enable the school to undertake more ambitious projects. Mr. Jessell says that research programs that depend on federal funding tend to be more cautions these days because there is so little of it around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But science suffers when researchers are reluctant to take risks. "One successful experiment, if it's sufficiently ambitious and risky, is going to drive the field forward in a way that hundreds of routine, humdrum, little incremental observations are just not going to do," Mr. Jessell says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Columbia's new campus also is getting assistance from the widow of Jerome L. Greene, a New York lawyer and real-estate investor who died in 1999. She donated $250 million for the construction of the Renzo Piano-designed glass tower that will house the Zuckerman Institute. The building will be named after her late husband.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Architects who designed the building have visited Columbia's science labs to perform experiments and understand the design needs of researchers first hand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The architects have come in with this conceptual vision of transparency and open space and interaction, and then the scientists have come in with the pragmatic view that there are many great, great architectural iconic buildings that don't work as buildings for science," says Mr. Jessell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new building will have space that increases the chances of researchers talking and running into each other while still having enough space for them to spend time alone or in smaller groups, Mr. Jessell says. "That's the spirit of adventure that we want to try and represent within the building."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The institute will also host a free education and outreach service for the local community that is manned by students and scientists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jessell says that Mr. Zuckerman will be an active presence in the institute. "He wants to be a neuroscientist," Mr. Jessell says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He'll be talking to the scientists, he'll be pestering them to explain what they're doing and he'll be ruthless in his dissection of things that don't make sense which is part and parcel of this academic life," Mr. Jessell says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar regained some lost ground versus most major rivals Monday, extending gains modestly after data showed durable-goods orders jumped more than expected in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ICE dollar index, which tracks the U.S. unit against six major rivals, edged up to 79.79 recently from late Friday's 79.762.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the greenback against a slightly larger basket of currencies, rose to 71.06 from 71 late Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for big-ticket U.S. goods jumped 4.6% in December, boosted by a large bunch of orders for <span class="companylink">Boeing Co</span>. aircraft. Economists had forecast a 2.3% rise. Stripping out the volatile transportation sector, orders rose by a still solid 1.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, pending home sales in December fell 4.3% as the inventory of lower-priced homes dried up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar lost ground versus most major rivals other than the Japanese yen last week, with safe-haven flows eroded as global equities rallied and Wall Street's S&amp;P 500 Index ended at its highest level since 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Last week it seemed that Japan and Europe were the focus. This week, the U.S. should be the focus given the Fed meeting and key GDP and payroll data," said Steven Barrow, currency and fixed-income strategist at Standard Bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This comes against the backdrop of an upward drift in U.S. bond yields, possibly brought about more by positive sentiment towards 'normalization' in euro zone financial markets than U.S. events. We suspect that the Fed meeting and U.S. data will bring a bit of balance back and U.S. yields won't shoot higher," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An estimate of fourth-quarter U.S. growth is due on Wednesday, the same day the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee concludes its first policy meeting of 2013. Friday brings the key January nonfarm payrolls figures and other U.S. employment data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In afternoon New York trade, the euro was at $1.3447 compared with $1.3459 late Friday. The dollar traded at ¥90.78 compared with ¥90.87, while the euro was at ¥122.07 from ¥122.36. The pound bought $1.5685 compared with $1.5763. The Australian dollar fell to $1.04 from $1.0416.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Against the yen, the dollar retreated after climbing to a new 31-month high during Asian trading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pound fell to its weakest level against the dollar since Aug. 21 in Europe trading, having shed more than 3% of its value so far this year. It also tumbled to a near-14 month low against the euro, as currency traders continued selling sterling after data Friday showed the U.K. economy contracted in the final three months of 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro had struck an 11-month high of $1.3480 at the end of last week as banks prepared to repay a larger-than-expected amount of special loans provided by the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span>.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales rose by 20% last year, signaling a market finally climbing back from the housing bust and contributing to the modest recovery of the U.S. economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing sector has been one of the main positives for U.S. growth for six consecutive quarters, and that trend is expected to continue. "We believe we have turned the corner," said Rob Bowman, president of Charter Homes &amp; Neighborhoods in Lancaster, Pa., which completed 189 sales last year, compared with 147 a year earlier. "Buyers we talk to are excited to buy a home again."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said Friday that an estimated 367,000 new homes were sold in 2012, up from 306,000 in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Bethune, president of Alpha Macroeconomic Foresights in Wenham, Mass., expects home sales to post a 10% to 15% increase again this year to around the 400,000 level as consumers become more encouraged about the economy. "The underlying fundamentals of the U.S. economy are pretty good," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures come amid other indications the housing market is getting back on track. Sales of previously occupied homes last year rose to their highest annual level in five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even with the healthy increase, new home sales still are depressed historically. Last year was the third-worst on record for new-home sales, highlighting the long road to recovery for the industry. Sales peaked at nearly 1.3 million in 2005 and plummeted to the lowest level on records dating to 1963 in 2011. So even as housing improves, the lower levels mean it can't boost economic growth as much as it did during the boom years at the start of the century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">December's results were down 7.3% on a monthly basis to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 369,000, but figures for September through November were revised upward.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Brett Arends </div><div>1007 words</div><div>26 January 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B7</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stock investors seem convinced that housing is headed for another boom. The shares of companies that build homes have rocketed in the past 18 months in anticipation of much better times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while signs for the housing market are indeed optimistic, housing stocks have risen too far, too fast. If you want to bet on rising home prices, you probably are better off investing directly in real estate, whether by buying your first home, trading up to a more expensive one or -- if the math works -- buying a rental property as an investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your correspondent is kicking himself. Eighteen months ago, in the summer of 2011, I saw the housing market turn before my eyes while I was shopping for a condo in the Miami area. The smart move would have been to take leave of my real-estate agent, head for the nearest brokerage house and buy stocks in home-building companies instead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since August 2011, the Philadelphia Housing Sector index of U.S. home-building stocks has jumped about 140%, while the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index is up about 30%. U.S. house prices overall have risen by less than 10%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The case for a housing turnaround -- at long last -- is strong. Experts say the U.S. needs to build more than 1.5 million new homes every year just to keep up with the creation of new households and to replace old buildings. For the past five years, the average has been 760,000. Last year, it was 650,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're still building housing at about half the rate that would be considered normal," says Michael Widner, a home-building analyst at investment firm <span class="companylink">Stifel Nicolaus</span>, which has $136 billion in assets under management. He believes the boom will continue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The industry has built too few homes recently because it spent years building too many. Most of the excess inventory now is gone, and what remains might not prove a drag on prices anyway. Much of it is in the wrong places: While vacancy rates remain high in Detroit and parts of Nevada and Florida, there are housing shortages elsewhere, such as in Silicon Valley. And some of the "inventory" built up during the bubble is unlivable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Think of the speculative housing developments in Florida swampland that were never occupied, next to golf courses that never got built. In total, U.S. home construction over the past decade, encompassing both the boom and the aftermath, has averaged just 1.3 million units a year, below the rate needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are other signs that the housing glut is at an end. According to U.S. Census data, the percentage of homes unoccupied is back down to where it was before the financial crisis. Rents nationwide have been edging up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After five years of falling prices, housing is now inexpensive by several key measures. The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller national home-price index is back to 2003 levels. When compared with average wages, prices are at levels seen in the mid-1990s, long before the boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most people buy homes with a mortgage, and rates for those have plummeted to record lows. A 30-year fixed-rate conventional mortgage is now 3.5% or less. All this makes housing cheap for people with jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, plenty of risks remain. Economists note that U.S. unemployment remains stubbornly high. No matter how cheap houses might be, families won't be able to afford them without income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the housing market continues to recover, home-building companies should see strong profits, says Crispin Odey, chairman of $12 billion hedge fund firm Odey &amp; Co. in London. Their operating profits will widen, their land holdings will rise in value, and they will sell their new homes much more quickly, saving on capital costs, he argues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Odey is an investor in home builders <span class="companylink">PulteGroup</span>, <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span> and <span class="companylink">KB Home</span>, and says the sector could continue to see substantial gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet investors should be cautious. At current levels, say analysts, home-building stocks have priced in much of the recovery ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Philadelphia Stock Exchange Housing Sector Index has rebounded far more significantly than housing itself. Shares of <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span> now trade at 1.9 times the per-share value of the company's net assets, approaching the 2.3 level seen in 2004-05. During the crash it sank as low as 0.6 times assets. <span class="companylink">PulteGroup</span> has swelled to 3.7 times its per-share net assets, a record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those asset values have been depressed by the slump and will be revalued upward if house prices continue to recover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet Stifel's Mr. Widner says the recovery "is already baked into prices." Even though expects the housing market to recover steadily over the next few years, he rates the stocks no better than a "hold" across the board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the average investor, housing surely offers a better bet than housing stocks. Prices are lower, and investors can benefit from leverage through a mortgage, putting down just 20% in cash for the chance to enjoy 100% of any later profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure, leverage was a disaster at the peak of the bubble, as investors were buying overpriced housing, often with risky flexible-rate loans. But buying inexpensive housing, with a low-cost, fixed-rate mortgage, offers a different balance of risks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate, famously, is about location, location, location. Each market is different. In some it is still cheaper to rent than to own. But in most of the country, real estate is now inexpensive. This is a good time to buy a first home, to trade up, or to buy a property as an investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At this point in the real-estate recovery, homes look like a much better investment than home-building stocks.</p>

</div><div class="author">By AnnaMaria Andriotis </div><div>916 words</div><div>25 January 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's that $1 million house really worth? Depends who you ask.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To determine the value of a property, appraisers are supposed to review purchase prices of similar, nearby homes that sold in the past six months. But when a property is much pricier than others in the neighborhood, it can be hard to find similar examples close by. As a result, their asking prices are often out of whack with values that are later determined by appraisals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The higher you go up the ladder in value generally the less data you have," says Danny Wiley, chief appraiser for LSI, an appraisal-management company based in Irvine, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To find relevant numbers, appraisers in many cases have been digging up older sales as far back as five years ago, consulting current listing prices that might not reflect what buyers are actually paying for a property and even looking at sales prices in other markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further complicating matters, some luxury real-estate values are partly determined by the services and amenities in that neighborhood. City cutbacks in police patrols, fire services, park maintenance and school-district funding can also contribute to lower property values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For sellers and buyers, the process often results in an appraisal amount that's below the agreed-upon purchase price of a home. Lenders, in turn, will typically lower the mortgage amount that they'll give a buyer, leaving the buyer to make up the difference, often with a larger down payment. Another scenario: The buyer refuses to pay more than the appraised amount and renegotiates the purchase price with the seller. And if that fails, buyers can decide to walk away from the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On average, one-third of real-estate agents said the appraisal process resulted in buyers and sellers delaying or canceling contracts or renegotiating to a lower sales price last year, according to a National Association of Realtors' monthly survey of roughly 3,000 agents. That's up from less than 10% in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts say this figure could grow going forward as the luxury real-estate market continues to surge. Appraisals can undervalue properties when markets are rising because they look backward at lower valuations, says Mark Fleming, chief economist at <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>, a real-estate analytics company. Some appraisers may not adjust for the discrepancy, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not just home purchases that are at risk. Homeowners trying to refinance can also be burned. With private jumbo mortgages, if the appraisal indicates that the borrower's loan amount is more than 80% of the value of the home, the borrower will likely have to put more money down if he wants to proceed. In other cases, a lower appraisal could keep borrowers from getting the lowest rate possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After buying a $2.3 million home in Oak Brook, Ill., last year, Robert Lattas decided to refinance his mortgage to lock in a lower rate. Mr. Lattas, a real-estate attorney, expected the home's value to increase since he had pumped $200,000 into improving the property. To his shock, two appraisers told him the upgrades -- which include hardwood floors and a new electronics system -- had left the home's value unchanged. Because the appraisal didn't lower his loan-to-value ratio, and despite his high credit score, Mr. Lattas says he's going to end up with a mortgage rate that's a quarter of a point more expensive than the lowest rates available. "It's a lot of money when you're talking about a [big] mortgage," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To protect themselves from a surprise appraisal, buyers and sellers can take some steps early on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Buyers, add a contingency clause in the contract: Include a statement in the contract that guarantees the buyer will receive the initial down payment back if the appraisal value is below the offer. That also leaves open the option of renegotiating or walking away from the deal without losing those funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Sellers, research county records: Counties assess home values to help determine the property taxes a homeowner will pay. Appraisers take that assessment into account while determining a valuation for the home. It's possible that the county's figures could be wrong -- and could be keeping buyers from purchasing the home. Daniel Fries, an Atlanta appraiser who specializes in luxury properties, says a client asked him to determine the value of his 50,000-square-foot property that was on the market for years. Mr. Fries says he found that the county had overvalued the property and assigned property taxes that were $50,000 more per year than the property's current value would warrant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Sellers, consider cost vs. value: The money owners pump into their homes in upgrades won't always be reflected in the appraised value. Upgrades that are highly customized -- like a mermaid fountain or a recording studio -- could lower a property's value. Northern Utah appraiser Rick Lifferth says buyers typically offer 20% below the asking price of highly customized homes. Lower purchase prices work their way into comparable sales data, resulting in lower appraisal values.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- Plywood maker <span class="companylink">Boise Cascade LLC</span> on Wednesday unveiled terms of its planned initial public offering, saying it intends to sell 11.8 million shares at between $16 and $18 apiece.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company indicated in a <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span> filing that it will float about 28% of its total shares outstanding. The deal would be the second IPO this year by a company tied to the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the top end of its price range, the IPO could fetch as much as $212 million, valuing the entire company at $746 million. <span class="companylink">Boise Cascade</span>'s shares are scheduled to start trading on the <span class="companylink">New York Stock Exchange</span> on Feb. 6, under the symbol BCC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with plywood, <span class="companylink">Boise Cascade</span> manufactures other products used mostly in residential construction, repair and remodeling projects. Its customers include wholesalers, home-improvement centers and retail lumberyards</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Idaho-based company is controlled by private-equity firm <span class="companylink">Madison Dearborn Partners LLC</span>. Its market debut is expected to follow that of <span class="companylink">TRI Pointe Homes Inc</span>., which is poised to go public Jan. 31, becoming the first IPO by a home builder since 2004, according to Dealogic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bankers have said that the strong performance of housing stocks, amid signs of improving home prices, sales and construction, has spurred demand for housing-related IPOs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Madison Dearborn first took control of <span class="companylink">Boise Cascade</span> in 2004, paying $3.7 billion to <span class="companylink">OfficeMax Inc</span>., which continues to hold about 20% of the company. Following the expected IPO, Madison Dearborn and <span class="companylink">OfficeMax</span> are expected to control 71.6% of <span class="companylink">Boise Cascade</span>'s shares outstanding, according to the filing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Madison Dearborn has sold several <span class="companylink">Boise Cascade</span> assets over the years, including $1.7 billion worth of timberland in 2005. It completed a $1.6 billion sale of the company's paper and packaging and newsprint operations to <span class="companylink">Boise Inc</span>. in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>. will be the IPO's lead bankers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- Blue-chip stocks rose, but the tech-heavy <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> Composite pulled back, as investors weighed mixed earnings reports and an unexpected drop in existing home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 28.09 points, or 0.2%, to 13677.79 in midday trading Tuesday. The benchmark hit its highest close since December 2007 on Friday. U.S. markets were closed Monday for the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index added 1.38 points, or 0.1%, to 1487.36. The <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> Composite Index dropped 4.13 points, or 0.1%, to 3130.57, as <span class="companylink">Google</span> fell 0.5% ahead of fourth-quarter earnings, due after the closing bell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Declines in the technology and health-care sectors offset gains in materials and telecommunications shares. <span class="companylink">Johnson &amp; Johnson</span> fell 0.6% after forecasting lower 2013 profits than analysts projected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insurer Travelers was the biggest gainer among <span class="companylink">Dow</span> components, rising 2.7%, while <span class="companylink">Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold</span>'s 5.2% climb put it among the biggest in the S&amp;P 500. The property casualty-insurer and miner both reported results that topped forecasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We had a mixed bag of earnings, and you couple that with the fact that the S&amp;P 500 broke out past its previous multiyear highs late last week, and the market's kind of taking a breather," said Joe Bell, senior equity analyst at Schaeffer's Investment Research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. slipped in December from a month earlier, the National Associations of Realtors reported. Economists in a <span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> poll had forecast an increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturers in the central Atlantic region said activity is contracting this month, the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond</span> reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among other stocks, Caterpillar declined 0.9% after the company announced that it uncovered deliberate accounting misconduct at Zhengzhou Siwei Mechanical &amp; Electrical Manufacturing beginning several years before Caterpillar acquired the company last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Verizon Communications</span> rose 0.8%. The telecommunications giant forecast an increase in wireless margins this year, but suffered from pension charges and the cost of subsidies used to lure smartphone customers to contracts in the latest quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">TD Ameritrade</span> advanced 3.4% after its quarterly results topped Wall Street's views and its base of new assets climbed to a record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">DuPont</span> rose 1.7% after the chemicals company reported fourth-quarter results that topped analysts' estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regional lender <span class="companylink">Regions Financial</span> gained 3.8% after swinging to a fourth-quarter profit, setting aside less cash to cover potential loan losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European Stocks</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares generally pulled back after policy action from the <span class="companylink">Bank of Japan</span> left financial markets underwhelmed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A better-than-expected set of data from Germany, however, helped improve the day's tone. The ZEW indicator for economic sentiment for Europe's largest economy jumped by 24.6 points to stand a level of 31.5 in January, exceeding expectations of a 9.5-level print.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All told, the benchmark Stoxx 600 index fell fractionally to 287.66. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 index also nudged barely lower, to 6179.17, snapping a three-session streak of gains. Germany's DAX retreated 0.7% to 7696.21, its biggest decline in a week, and France's CAC-40 shed 0.6% to 3741.01.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> slumped 1.9% amid speculation the firm would issue a profit warning. A representative from the bank declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In London, <span class="companylink">SABMiller</span> rose 1.3% following its third-quarter trading update. While the global brewing and bottling company flagged weak demand in China and slowing global volume growth, it did report an improvement in its Latin American and Australian businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Barclays</span> announced after the close that it had put its U.K. investment banking staff on notice for potential job cuts as part of a restructuring effort. Shares ended down 0.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among midcap stocks, online retailer <span class="companylink">Ocado</span> rose 6.3% after appointing former <span class="companylink">Marks &amp; Spencer</span> boss Stuart Rose as its nonexecutive chairman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In bond markets, Spanish yields fell after the country sold more three- and six-month Treasury bills than planned at auction, while funding costs also fell sharply. The country also drew record demand of 24 billion euros ($32 billion) when it launched its first new 10-year benchmark bond in over a year.</p>

</div><div class="author">By A.D. Pruitt </div><div>770 words</div><div>23 January 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Citigroup Inc</span>. became the top equity underwriter for real-estate investment trusts in 2012, grabbing the No. 1 spot from <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>. became the top equity underwriter for real-estate investment trusts in 2012, grabbing the No. 1 spot from <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span>, the longtime leader of the business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>, which was in sixth place in 2011, vaulted to the top position partly by using its balance sheet. Bank executives say one strategy they used to get their foot in the door with new customers was increasing <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>'s lending to REITs through credit facilities and other bank loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We decided we were going to increase our capital commitment to the REIT sector because we felt confident we could manage the risk," said Thomas Flexner, global head of real estate for <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Flexner said <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>'s increase in lending wasn't done directly in exchange for the new underwriting business. But because <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> was dealing with the REITs as a lender, the companies "increasingly included us in transactions where maybe, historically, we weren't a top three bank for them," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs are big customers of investment banks because they are required to pay at least 90% of their income as dividends to maintain special tax status. That means they rely heavily on the sale of equity and debt to raise capital, and that could mean large fees for Wall Street firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs raised nearly $40 billion in equity in 2012, a record. The sector accounted for 15% of the $258 billion in total equity issuance last year for all financial firms, up from 8% in 2009 when many REIT shares reached their post-downturn low points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street firms raked in a total of $976 million in underwriting fees from REIT equity issues in 2012, up from $930 million in 2011, according to Dealogic, which tracks deals by all publicly traded equity and mortgage REITs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>, which has been trying to expand its investment-banking business in a number of sectors, was lead manager in 45 deals with a combined value of $6.52 billion, according to Dealogic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span><span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span> unit of <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>. was second with 52 deals valued at $6.26 billion. Jeff Horowitz, head of real-estate investment banking for <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, said the firm tends "to focus on our role and repeat business as they appropriately reflect our ability to be on the front line in executing transactions."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other big moves last year, <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>. jumped to number five as lead manager in REIT equity deals last year, underwriting 12 deals worth $2.9 billion. The firm, which declined to comment, was 10th in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the biggest drop, <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> went from second place in 2011 to 10th place last year. Jeff Harte, a banking analyst at <span class="companylink">Sandler O'Neill &amp; Partners</span>, suggested that some REITs may have gone to other investment banks after Moody's Investors Service downgraded <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>'s credit rating last June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm not as surprised to see them slip down the list," Mr. Harte said. "Those kinds of concerns tend to drive customers away" because there is the perception the bank will be less committed to use its capital to support deals if profit is weaker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Morgan Stanley spokeswoman declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Flexner of <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> said the bank became more aggressive in pursuing REIT underwriting business after the sector weathered the brutal downturn with very few defaults on debt obligations. He said <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> recruited a dozen new REIT clients in 2012 for equity deals. He declined to identify any of them. The bank's largest deal last year was a roughly $1 billion private issuance of stock of <span class="companylink">Ventas Inc</span>., a health-care landlord.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> also topped the rankings for most equity raised overall in 2012 for the entire financial sector, according to Dealogic. The bank was less successful with REIT debt deals last year, ranking number fifth with $3.9 billion in transactions. That marks a drop from fourth place in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs have been using capital raised through equity sales to pay down debt and make acquisitions. Also there is keen investor demand for REIT equity "because rates are low, the [financial] crisis is behind us and they pay high dividends," Mr. Harte said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. existing-home sales last year rose to their highest annual level in five years and registered their largest annual jump since 2004, the latest sign that more housing markets hit bottom last year amid ultralow interest rates and strong investor demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> reported Tuesday that an estimated 4.65 million previously owned homes were sold in 2012, up 9.2% from 2011. Total home sales were higher than in any year since 2007, when 5.04 million homes were sold; at the time, that was the lowest annual tally since 1998.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales in December edged down by around 1% from November but still stood nearly 13% above the year-earlier level. Sales have now increased from their year-ago level for 18 consecutive months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing markets have rallied over the past year as the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> has moved aggressively to lower interest rates. Mortgage rates stood at an average of 3.35% for the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in December, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, compared with 3.96% a year ago. Investors have also played key roles buying properties that can be fixed up and rented out, which has helped whittle down the overhang of inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing sector still faces headwinds, including conservative mortgage-lending standards and many households that have too little in savings to make a down payment. Millions of mortgages are delinquent or in the foreclosure process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say it is difficult to predict sales gains of the same magnitude in 2013 if the number of homes being offered for sale continues to decline. The number of homes for sale fell to 1.82 million units at the end of December -- down by 8.5% from the previous month and 21.6% from a year earlier -- to the lowest level since January 2001.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While inventory typically declines during the winter, the dearth of supply is frustrating home buyers and real-estate agents who frequently say that there is little to buy. "If we had twice as much inventory, we'd have twice as many sales," said Syd Leibovitch, president of Rodeo Realty, a Los Angeles-based brokerage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say listings are down because sellers are reluctant to sell at deep discounts to what their homes were once worth, particularly in light of the prospect that their home could be worth more if they wait.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At December's sales pace, it would take 4.4 months to sell the supply of homes listed for sale. That figure is down from a peak of 12.1 months in July 2010 and back to levels that prevailed in early 2005, when home sales and prices were surging as the housing market neared its peak.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Maura Webber Sadovi   </div><div>698 words</div><div>23 January 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A real-estate development company headed by a former Miss Reno Rodeo sold a controlling stake in six Las Vegas-area shopping centers in a deal that reflects growing investor appetite for commercial property in weak markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Territory Inc</span>., run by Terri Sturm, sold a 78% stake in the properties to Inland Diversified Real Estate, a nontraded real-estate investment trust. The deal values the properties at $288 million, which includes $149 million of new debt being put on the properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shopping centers include Centennial Center, an 857,000-square-foot property about 12 miles northwest of Las Vegas's gambling strip, and five other smaller centers with a total of about 840,000 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently, investors were shunning commercial property in smaller cities, especially those hit hard by the housing crisis. But as the U.S. economy has added jobs and the housing market has begun to recover, property in these markets has grown more attractive to investors looking for better returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales volume of retail properties in midsize cities such as Las Vegas and Atlanta more than doubled last year from 2010, to $11.1 billion, based on preliminary numbers, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, a real-estate research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ian Galanis, a broker with Mountain High Real Estate Advisors in Salt Lake City, represented Territory and said increased liquidity is finally seeping back into the Las Vegas market. A few years ago, "you just wouldn't have tried to sell unless you had to," Mr. Galanis says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inland Diversified expects an initial annual return on its Las Vegas investment in the 7% range, well above the 5% yield it expects on properties the company recently bought in stronger markets such as New York and New Jersey. The return is even more attractive compared with low yields on debt investments these days, which can be below 2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, retail in Las Vegas remains a bold bet given the city's weak economy. Over the past four years, through last year's third quarter, effective retail rents in the Las Vegas area fell 15.4%, the biggest drop of the 80 markets monitored by <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>., a real-estate research firm. Effective rents include landlord concessions, such as rent-free periods, used to entice tenants to take space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Grocery-anchored retail is definitely doing a lot better than nongrocery anchored, but Las Vegas is still very weak," says Brad Doremus, a senior analyst with Reis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vacancies in Las Vegas shopping centers ticked up to 13.1% in the fourth quarter, from 12.8% in the year-earlier period and well above the 10.7% nationally, Reis says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the properties Inland Diversified is buying are outperforming the Las Vegas market with a 5% vacancy rate partly because they were built in populated areas that didn't depend on new homeowners to move in. Also, Inland Diversified executives point out that the properties are anchored by <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span>, Sam's Club and <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>, value-oriented retailers that are a hedge against a slow-growing economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, they say they are encouraged by some recent signs of job growth in Las Vegas. "We think Las Vegas has suffered the worst it is going to see," says Barry Lazarus, president of Inland Diversified. Based in Oakbrook, Ill., Inland Diversified is one of six nontraded REITs sponsored by Inland Real Estate Investment Corp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The properties were developed by Ms. Sturm, who learned how to ride horses at her father's ranch and won the Miss Reno Rodeo contest -- a combination riding and beauty competition -- in 1980. Later, she worked for mall giant <span class="companylink">Simon Property Group</span> in Indianapolis before starting her own retail-development company in the early 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Sturm decided to sell in part because more than $100 million in debt on the properties was coming due in the next few years. She said buyers saw more value in the properties than lenders, so she opted to sell rather than refinance.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Carmel Melouney </div><div>809 words</div><div>22 January 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A24</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Half-eaten salads tossed out by Midtown office workers these days can end up being carted to an upstate compost farm and then returned to Midtown buildings for use as fertilizer on green rooftops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With more green roofs sprouting up across New York's skyline, the <span class="companylink">Durst Organization</span> says it will spend between $750,000 and $1 million to install more than an acre of green space atop its Midtown Manhattan buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real-estate company, whose commercial portfolio includes One Bryant Park, One World Trade Center and Four Times Square, among others, launched its composting program at the beginning of 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Food waste from the pantries and kitchens from the Durst buildings in the city -- 11 buildings totaling 13 million square feet -- is now hauled up to Dutchess County to be turned into compost at the McEnroe Organic Farm in the Harlem Valley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The compost and soil is then brought back to the city to be used on the company's green roofs in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I haven't heard of any other real-estate property company recycling their food into compost for a green roof," said Amy Norquist, president and chief executive of Greensulate, a Manhattan-based company that designs, builds and maintains green roofs. "It's forward thinking."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Norquist, whose company helped the Fashion Institute of Technology install nearly 20,000 square feet of green roof two years ago, said the benefits of such projects include improved air quality, energy efficiency, decreased temperatures, storm-water management, mitigation of climate change and improved productivity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For companies, adding green space is a huge thing that provides an . . . increase in employee productivity," she said. "People like looking out on a green space; it literally makes them happier."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Durst Organization</span>'s green-roof system is able to retain about 55,000 gallons of water that would otherwise wind up in the sewer system. The company's first green roofs, which are covered in a mixture of hardy, low-lying plants that don't require deep soil, were installed last March above the Durst offices at One Bryant Park and at 675 Third Ave.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By spring, the company will have installed green roofs on eight of its buildings, including 205 E. 42nd St., 655 and 733 Third Ave., 1133 and 1155 Sixth Ave. and 114 W. 47th St.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Green roofs are an increasingly important part of our urban ecosystem," said Helena Durst, the organization's vice president who initiated the program. "Beyond diverting storm water runoff, they provide cooling by absorbing sunlight that would otherwise be converted to heat energy, and they can capture pollutants and filter noxious gases."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company has enlisted three students from the <span class="companylink">High School for Environmental Studies</span> in Hell's Kitchen to study the high-rise foliage and determine the benefits of green roofs in settings like Manhattan. Seniors Samuel Fok, 18 years old, Daniela Escobar, 17, and Samantha Hoffman, 17, have spent several hours every two weeks testing samples from the green rooftops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're just trying to identify the plants that we find that are on the roof, and we're trying to see what weeds come up and whether they're invasive or noninvasive species," Ms. Hoffman, who intends to study geology after graduation, said of the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matthew Washington, manager of special projects at <span class="companylink">Durst Organization</span>, has been working with the students from his alma mater. "The intention is to create a long-term fellowship program with the school so that a new group of students each year can work on the green roofs," said Mr. Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other property companies are also getting into the green roof trend, encouraged by government incentives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, the New York state Assembly introduced a tax abatement of $4.50 a square foot for the installation of green roofs in New York City, and the Department of Environmental Protection introduced funding for green roofs with a focus being storm-water management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2007, Tishman Speyer installed an 18,000-square-foot green roof atop Radio City Music Hall, saving approximately 566,000 gallons of water from the city's storm-water system annually. The Albanese Organization also plans to install a 6,050-square-foot green roof on a commercial building the company will construct at 510 W. 22nd St.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russell Albanese, the company's chairman, said the current five-story building, which is adjacent to the High Line, will be redeveloped into a 10-story commercial building for restaurant, gallery and office tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A green roof on a building provides space for people to gather on the roof and be outdoors," said Mr. Albanese. "Tenants want to get away from being locked in a glass tower."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Ilona Billington                And Paul Hannon   </div><div>1095 words</div><div>20 January 2013</div><div>19:04</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House prices rose across the U.K. in January, while the number of new sellers also increased as market sentiment improved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a return to the highs seen before the financial crisis is unlikely without a sustained economic recovery, and with figures for the fourth quarter to be released Friday likely to record another contraction, that is far from assured.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A monthly survey by online estate agency Rightmove showed that asking prices on its website rose 0.2% in the first weeks of January, compared with December, and were 2.4% higher than a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, house prices slumped 3.3% on the month and were just 1.4% higher in annual terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey also showed a 22% increase in the number of new sellers advertising on the website, and crucially, rather than reflecting a sharp increase in forced sellers, Rightmove said seven out of 10 of the new sellers were attempting to move because they wanted to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Those coming to market this month have taken a pragmatic pricing approach and kept their asking prices pretty much the same as sellers in December," said Miles Shipside, director and housing market analyst at Rightmove. "While the number of sellers financially fit enough to come to market is still well down on pre-credit crunch levels, there appears to be an increased willingness among those that can to give it a go."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.K.'s housing market has been pretty flat over the past 12 months, with prices rising only about 1% by the end of the year, while the number of transactions has also been little changed over the period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the early weeks of the new year, however, there are increasing signs that confidence in prices and the ability to secure a mortgage are improving, which is helping to get the property market moving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, a separate survey by lenders Halifax, owned by Lloyds Group, showed that mortgage repayments as a proportion of income are at their most affordable level in 10 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After peaking at 48% of an average income in the third quarter of 2007, homeowners are now paying an average of 28% of their income to make their monthly mortgage repayments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Mortgage affordability has improved significantly over the past few years as a result of falls in house prices and cuts in mortgage rates," said Martin Ellis, housing economist at Halifax. "This development has been a key factor supporting housing demand and is expected to remain so in 2013 as interest rates remain low."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That improvement in affordability and a likely sustainable economic recovery this year could help lift house prices past their previous peak by 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the Centre for Business and Economic Research said U.K. house prices could rise to an average of £223,000 ($357,888) in 2014, a 0.7% increase from the previous, pre-debt crisis peak in 2007, if a sustainable economic recovery takes hold this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Next year, U.K. property prices will hit a significant milestone, passing their precrisis peak for the first time," said Daniel Solomon, CEBR economist and the main author of the report. "This will be driven by fundamentals, such as a return to modest economic growth and restricted housing supply increases. Policy tools, such as further quantitative easing and the Funding for Lending Scheme, could also support house prices through their positive effects on the mortgage market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking further ahead, the CEBR said house prices could reach £261,000 by 2018, a 19.1% increase from 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, it is far from certain that the economy will experience even a modest recovery this year. The <span class="companylink">Office for National Statistics</span> will Friday release its first estimate of gross domestic product in the final three months of 2012, and economists surveyed by <span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> last week expected it to record a decline of 0.1%. Having contracted in the first and second quarters, the economy grew in the third, but that appears to have been a short-lived boost delivered by ticket sales for the Olympic Games.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy has been in the doldrums since the middle of 2010, and has struggled to find a driver for growth to replace debt-fueled spending by the government and consumers, on which it relied in the years running up to the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists do expect the economy to expand this year, but only moderately. Respected economic forecaster the <span class="companylink">Ernst &amp; Young</span> ITEM Club said on Monday that it expects the economy to grow by just 0.9% this year before staging a slow revival to 1.9% in 2014 and 2.5% in 2015. It said the pickup this year will be driven by consumer spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The consumer revival is well under way," said Peter Spencer, chief economic adviser to the ITEM Club. "By the end of the year earnings are expected to be outpacing inflation for the first time since 2007, while nearly a quarter of a million people are likely to be added to the U.K. payroll."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A monthly survey from data firm Markit on Monday found households were less downbeat about their finances in January as their views on their own personal financial situation, access to credit, inflation and job security all improved from December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The headline-household-finances balance rose to 37.7 in January from 36.8 in December. However, as the figure remains below the key 50 level it signals that household finances are still deteriorating, but at a slower pace than a month ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"January's survey provides a rare spot of good news on the consumer front, with households' financial sentiment rebounding appreciably after a dismal end to 2012," said Markit economist Tim Moore. "The unfavorable economic backdrop and squeezed incomes are clearly making it difficult to keep household finances on an even keel. Overall, however…January's upturn from the lows of 2012 suggests that some gradual financial improvements are being made despite fragile conditions across the U.K. economy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Details of the survey chime with easing inflation—the rate is expected to slow closer toward the Bank of England's 2% target by the end of this year—and a stable unemployment rate. However, as government spending cuts continue, public-sector workers remain more pessimistic than those working in the private sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rise in house prices would help support a recovery in consumer spending, since their homes account for the bulk of Britons' wealth.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bully for Stocks</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Talk about a rally. Stocks reached a five-year high this week, buoyed by better-than-expected housing and employment data and progress on the debt-ceiling talks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.2% to 13649, while the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index rose 0.95% to 1485.98.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home Improvement</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts rose 12.1% in December from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted rate of 954,000, the Commerce Department said. The jump, driven by a surge in apartment construction, sent starts to the highest level since 2008. An estimated 651,400 housing units were completed in 2012, up 11.4% from 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Hiring</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of workers filing new applications for jobless benefits declined by 37,000 to a seasonally adjusted 335,000 for the week ended Jan. 12, the lowest level in five years, according to the Labor Department. Economists had expected 370,000 new benefit applications. The data are the latest signal of an improving job market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Global Warning</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New research from MIT's Sloan School of Management finds that global mutual funds -- which can invest anywhere in the world -- are trailing other funds, causing investors to miss out on more than 2% a year in additional returns. The study attributed the poor performance to the fact that the funds tend to be too concentrated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Protecting Borrowers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage holders will soon get more protection under new <span class="companylink">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</span> rules slated to take effect in 2014. Mortgage-loan servicers, which collect loan payments, will have to evaluate all options for loan assistance for troubled borrowers, instead of steering them toward those in the servicer's interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Art Shines</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales at international auction house Christie's increased 10% from 2011 to 2012, and the average number of registered bidders per auction was 53% greater than a decade ago. The auction house said it sold 686 works at auction in 2012 for more than $1 million each and 49 works for more than $10 million.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It could be three years before the South Ferry subway station at the tip of lower Manhattan, heavily damaged in superstorm Sandy, is fully restored to service, <span class="companylink">Metropolitan Transportation Authority</span> officials now say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even before it launches a rebuilding effort estimated to cost $600 million, the MTA must decide whether to move some of the electronic equipment of one of its most vulnerable stations to a higher elevation, to guard against future floods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas Prendergast, the president of the MTA's transit division, told reporters in December that it would likely be at least a year before the bidding and construction on South Ferry could be completed, but the agency now believes it will be substantially longer. Some intermittent subway service could return, however, before the station is fully finished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">South Ferry, which reopened in 2009 after a $545 million renovation and expansion, was inundated by the storm surge from the harbor on the night of the Oct. 29 storm. It filled with 14.5 million gallons of water, a depth of 80 feet from the track bed to the station's mezzanine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MTA officials say they are hoping to put out contracts for the station's rebuilding sometime later this year. They are expecting the heavy construction work -- such as replacing salt-corroded signal systems -- to take another one to two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The MTA's rebuilding estimate includes $350 million for physical repairs to the station, where workers already have rebuilt a tile wall that was swept loose by flooding; $200 million for replacing signals; and $30 million for third-rail equipment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The water has been pumped out of South Ferry, but on Thursday afternoon evidence of the flooding was everywhere, as Wynton Habersham, the MTA's chief electrical officer, walked the station's muck-drenched platform. He ducked into a signal-relay room at the end of the platform, which had held about 600 electromechanical relays, switch boards and circuit breakers. Almost all of them were ruined by the corrosive, brackish water that poured in from the harbor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A simple cleanup wouldn't suffice" to restore the station, which served 14,000 No. 1 train riders per day, including many coming from the Staten Island Ferry, Mr. Habersham said. The MTA will have to replace hundreds of relays and thousands of feet of wiring in the South Ferry complex alone, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the agency does so, engineers will have to decide if they will try to rebuild the relay rooms on higher ground, where they will be less vulnerable to flooding. That would force the MTA to change the specifications and layout of the equipment it is replacing. "If we decide to just harden that room and make it like a submarine, which is not likely to be the case," said Mr. Habersham, his department could simply replace what has been ruined -- but moving the equipment would require more planning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If it's relocated to the park upstairs, then we'll do it up there," added Mr. Habersham, in a reference to Battery Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">South Ferry was destined to be a complicated site for rebuilding. The structural concrete box of the station already sits mostly below the water table; Mr. Habersham compared it to the "bathtub" that forms the foundation of the World Trade Center. Three subway lines cross above the station's roof -- the No. 4 and 5 lines and R trains toward Brooklyn, and the loop track of the old No. 1 station, which is now being used to turn No. 1 trains for the trip back uptown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the difficulties of restoring the hardware of the station also reflect a problem facing the entire subway system: the vastly diminished reliability of the parts of the system that survived. While some equipment subjected to corrosion was quickly refurbished and brought back into service, that equipment is now much more likely to fail -- and to fail sooner than it might have without exposure to floodwaters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the MTA restored service on the R train from adjoining Whitehall Street through its tunnel into Brooklyn on Dec. 21, equipment in that section of the line has failed at least once a day, including again on Thursday morning, Mr. Habersham said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrosion has had effects both visible and hidden. In the relay room at South Ferry, a subcontractor scrubbed clean the steel pins that held the relay boxes in place. Days later, the lichen-colored corrosion spots had returned in force.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That's why the manufacturers felt you have to just get rid of it," Mr. Habersham said. "There's not much you can do with it once it's been exposed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To cope with breakdowns, the signals division has been forced to staff the Montague Tube, which carries the R train under the East River, 24 hours a day since it reopened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere, scores of workers have been reassigned to manually move track switches and realign trains in the yards that were damaged by flooding. In the process, they have been racking up overtime hours and working in dangerous conditions, MTA spokesman Adam Lisberg said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The MTA estimates it will cost $700 million to repair signals systemwide, the largest single line item in its preliminary $5 billion damage estimate.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home construction jumped in December to the highest level in more than four years, a trend that bodes well for the economy and jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders started construction at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 954,000 units in December, the highest pace of construction since June 2008. The December gain was up 12% from November and 37% from the same month a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase was led by a surge in apartment construction, with starts up 116% for buildings with five or more units. Developers of such buildings, which make up 35% of all new residential construction, anticipate that demand for rental housing will keep growing in coming years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, construction of single-family homes, which makes up the bulk of new-home building and has hovered near all-time lows for the past three years, rose 18.5% from December 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest gains for single-family building were in the West, where starts rose 43.3%, and the South, where starts rose by 32.3% annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Vitner, senior economist at <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>, said that absorption of apartments, or the rate at which new units become occupied by renters once completed, is still well ahead of the rate at which apartment builders are finishing projects. That means vacancy rates should continue to fall -- and rents to rise -- for the next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate research firm <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>. reported that residential rents climbed 3.8% in 2012, up from 2.4% in 2011. The firm projects annual increases of 4% to 4.5% through 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gain in construction activity is good news for the economy because it could lead to more jobs. Construction typically is a big job creator during expansions, but the industry has been slow to staff up during the current recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between 2006 and 2011, more than 2.2 million workers in the construction industry lost their jobs, and since then only 110,000 workers have been rehired, according to the <span class="companylink">Bureau of Labor Statistics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some economists say hiring is starting to pick up. "The rebound in construction is lifting a part of the economy that had been languishing. We're creating jobs for people who had been unemployed or underemployed," Mr. Vitner said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ed Welburn, chief designer for <span class="companylink">General Motors</span>, was in the company archives years ago when he spotted something familiar in a framed 1930s Cadillac ad hanging on the wall: a row of white stones along the roadside grass, similar to the ones outside his house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As he dug deeper, looking through more vintage luxury-car ads -- many set against backdrops of Tudor-style mansions with grand front lawns -- he soon realized he was looking at pictures of his own neighborhood, Palmer Woods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Some of the homes haven't changed at all," says Mr. Welburn, who has lived in the historic Detroit enclave for about 30 years. Among the images in the archive, Mr. Welburn recently discovered one of his own house, a 1927 Georgian colonial, with a gleaming 1930 LaSalle parked out front.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Situated near the northern edge of the city, about 8 miles from downtown, Palmer Woods is where Detroit's tight street grid relaxes into winding avenues lined by stately 5,000-square-foot Tudors, mixed in with unique houses designed by the likes of Frank Lloyd Wright, Minoru Yamasaki and Albert Kahn. First developed during the 1910s, it has long been home to Detroit's political, industrial and cultural elite, from the Romneys to the Fishers to the former heads of GM and Chrysler.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the neighborhood remains a haven for leaders in business and the arts, as well as doctors, lawyers and university professors. More recently, it has managed to attract some newcomers from the suburbs, a significant achievement in a city that has lost more than half its population in the last 50 years. One of the newest immigrants to Palmer Woods is Mike Duggan, a former county prosecutor who recently stepped down as head of the <span class="companylink">Detroit Medical Center</span> to prepare a bid for mayor of Detroit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Palmer Woods homes are a window into the wealth and artistic expression that flowed from Detroit's breakneck expansion in the early 20th century and earned the city the nickname "Paris of the Midwest." They feature elevators and grand ballrooms, large mahogany-paneled music rooms and marble crafted by artisans brought in from Italy. There are libraries with moving walls (Prohibition-era wet bars concealed behind them) and colorful tile work by celebrated potters, including Detroit's own Pewabic Pottery. One home has a pub fitted into its basement, its pieces dismantled and shipped over from England.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet today, because of the deterioration in the city's economic fortunes -- not to mention the houses themselves -- even some of the most distinctive Palmer Woods homes are priced as garden-variety colonials would be in other cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One property now on the market is a 10,000-square-foot mansion built in 1922 by Charles Van Dusen, then president of S.S. Kresge Co., precursor to <span class="companylink">Kmart Corp</span>. The house has seven bedrooms, nine bathrooms, a walnut-paneled entrance hall, carved marble fireplace, walk-in vaults and a ballroom on the third floor. It's listed at just under $700,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These are wonderful houses for the cost," says Graham Beal, director of the renowned <span class="companylink">Detroit Institute of Arts</span>, who moved to Palmer Woods 13 years ago and lives in 6,000-square-foot replica of an English Cotswold manor house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, Mr. Beal was working with an insurance agent to update his homeowner's policy. "The insurance agent was scratching his head" trying to come up with a replacement value, Mr. Beal explained, because much of the house's craftsmanship couldn't be reproduced today. Ultimately, the agent pegged the replacement value at about twice the market value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Palmer Woods itself has changed little over the years, residents say, even as the city around it has suffered. A strong neighborhood association, whose activities include home tours and staging jazz and classical concerts in residents' homes, has helped stave off the blight that has crept into other prime areas. The neighborhood is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area has seen its share of foreclosures and vacancies in recent years, though. The Romney family's old 5,500-square-foot house on Balmoral Drive, where Mitt Romney lived as a boy, fell into foreclosure several times, bouncing between lenders and becoming a neighborhood eyesore. Under orders from Wayne County, it was demolished in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen Williams, a real-estate agent who also lives in Palmer Woods, says the neighborhood is rebounding, thanks in part to interest from young professionals and empty-nesters and a drop in property tax rates several years ago when the area became an urban enterprise zone. Right now, he has five clients searching for homes in the area but inventory is tight. "If I could find them a house, they'd buy right now," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Geographically, the neighborhood is largely buffered from the rest of the city, with a cemetery on the north side, a large park to the south and few entry points from the major streets surrounding it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inside the community, the mansions sit on flat, open lots, without gates or fencing in between. Palmer Woods' planner, landscape architect Ossian Cole Simonds, designed it with curving streets, irregular lots, expansive lawns and no raised curbs -- just the white stones dotting the roadside -- making it feel more like a park than a rigid subdivision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not on a grid. It's fluid," says John Sayah, an IT management consultant who moved from Washington, D.C., to a Mediterranean-style Palmer Woods villa with a glass-enclosed conservatory, after his wife got a job in the Detroit area last year. "The streets go back and forth, and people just keep running into each other."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home styles vary widely, from castle-like Tudors with brick or stone exteriors to stucco-clad French-style chateaus to angular modern houses with horizontal lines and floor-to-ceiling windows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first houses came up in the 1910s, as Detroit was on its way to becoming one of the world's wealthiest cities. William and Alfred Fisher, of Fisher Body Co., an auto-body builder founded in 1908, built some of Palmer Woods' grandest homes, including one totaling over 22,000 square feet, with an indoor pool, eight-car garage, extensive gardens in the back and a wrought-iron conservatory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 1920s, the brothers, seeking more room for the gardens, bought two adjacent lots and had the houses on them moved about a block away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A second wave of building, after World War II, helped bring more modern homes, including one designed by Mr. Yamasaki, architect of New York's original World Trade Center towers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the south, along West Seven Mile Road, is Frank Lloyd Wright's Turkel-Benbow house, commissioned in 1955 by parking-lot heiress Dorothy S. Turkel, and later owned by Domino's Pizza founder Tom Monaghan, The boxy building, part of Mr. Wright's Usonian Automatic series of precast-concrete homes, was purchased in 2006 out of foreclosure by Norman Silk and Dale Morgan, co-owners of a local floral business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The neighborhood's architectural anchor is the 40,000-square-foot Bishop Gallagher house, the largest residence within city limits. Built by the Fishers, it was donated to the Catholic Church and housed leaders of the diocese until the church sold it in 1995 to former Detroit PistonJohn "Spider" Salley. It's now owned by Great Faith Ministries, a religious group with churches in Detroit and Atlanta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other notable residents of the area have included William Knudsen, president of GM in the late 1930s, and K.T. Keller, Chrysler's president in the 1930s and '40s, as well as former Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in Palmer Woods reflect a Metro Detroit housing market that's just now recovering from a free fall during the housing and auto industry crises. In the third quarter of 2012, the median sale price of a home in Metro Detroit was $75,700, up 13.8% from a year earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors; the nationwide mean, by comparison, was $186,100, up 7.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many, Palmer Woods still is a tough sell. Its aging homes and their exotic features typically require a lot of upkeep and costly repairs. Detroit's fiscal woes have diminished municipal services. Palmer Woods residents pay about $495 a year to their homeowners association to fund private security, landscaping of some public areas and snow removal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others see in Palmer Woods' bargain prices an opportunity for ordinary people to live like titans of industry. "You can't buy a house like this for less than $1 million in the 'burbs," says Scott Moorhead, a specialty-chemical salesman, who moved from the suburb of Royal Oak into a nearly 4,000-square-foot Tudor revival in August. "They don't build houses like this anymore."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bully for Stocks</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Talk about a rally. Stocks reached a five-year high this week, buoyed by better-than-expected housing and employment data and progress on the debt-ceiling talks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.2% to 13649, while the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index rose 0.95% to 1485.98.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home Improvement</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts rose 12.1% in December from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted rate of 954,000, the Commerce Department said. The jump, driven by a surge in apartment construction, sent starts to the highest level since 2008. An estimated 651,400 housing units were completed in 2012, up 11.4% from 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Hiring</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of workers filing new applications for jobless benefits declined by 37,000 to a seasonally adjusted 335,000 for the week ended Jan. 12, the lowest level in five years, according to the Labor Department. Economists had expected 370,000 new benefit applications. The data are the latest signal of an improving job market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Global Warning</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New research from MIT's Sloan School of Management finds that global mutual funds—which can invest anywhere in the world—are trailing other funds, causing investors to miss out on more than 2% a year in additional returns. The study attributed the poor performance to the fact that the funds tend to be too concentrated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Protecting Borrowers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage holders will soon get more protection under new <span class="companylink">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</span> rules slated to take effect in 2014. Mortgage-loan servicers, which collect loan payments, will have to evaluate all options for loan assistance for troubled borrowers, instead of steering them toward those in the servicer's interest.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the continuing recovery in commercial real estate, some properties are changing hands at fire-sale prices, a reminder that lenders still have lots of properties on their books that they are selling at deep discounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest example came Friday, when the New York La Guardia Airport Marriott hotel was sold for about $22 million, roughly one-third the price it fetched when it was sold in 2007, according to people familiar with the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 438-room hotel is one of the first large acquisitions made by Rubicon Cos., a private Greenwich, Conn., real-estate investment company founded by veteran hotel industry executive Marc Gordon. Rubicon bought the property from a lender group that included a unit of <span class="companylink">Capmark Financial Group Inc</span>. The sale comes a little over a year after lenders took the property back from <span class="companylink">RLJ Lodging Trust</span>. A predecessor company to <span class="companylink">RLJ Lodging Trust</span> had acquired the La Guardia Marriott in 2007 and later defaulted on the debt. Former media magnate Robert L. Johnson is the founder and chairman of RLJ Lodging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The price point we bought it at is clearly a major part of the property's attraction," said Mr. Gordon, adding that it is in an attractive location near Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, the low selling price is somewhat puzzling to some lodging analysts. The hotel's occupancy rate over the past 12 months has been relatively high, in the 80% range. Daily room rates listed on the hotel's website start at $159. Yet, the $22 million selling price equals about $50,000 per room, far below the $163,130 average price paid in the New York City outer boroughs over the 12-month period ending in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average price paid in Manhattan for the same period was $461,458, and some Manhattan hotels have fetched prices in the $700,000 range per room and higher, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, a real-estate research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airport hotels typically are valued at prices lower than their central business district counterparts but higher than traditional suburban properties, said Tom McConnell, executive managing director of the hotel transactions group at Cushman &amp; Wakefield, the real-estate services firm that represented <span class="companylink">Capmark</span> in the sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lower price may partly reflect the condition of the property, which is in need of capital improvements both to its interior and exterior. In addition, hotels near La Guardia have been challenged in recent years by new competition. In the past, budget-conscious customers would stay at hotels near La Guardia Airport, which is located in the borough of Queens, because they were considerably less expensive than hotels in Manhattan. But in recent years, a number of moderately priced hotels have been built in Manhattan. And since Manhattan, not Queens, is often the destination of travelers, "many folks coming to New York would just as soon stay in Manhattan," said John Fox, a senior vice president with hotel consulting firm PKF Consulting USA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Capmark</span>, one of the biggest commercial real-estate lenders to go bust in the financial downturn, put the property on the market last spring after emerging from bankruptcy protection in 2011. While the tidal wave of steeply discounted hotel properties didn't occur to the degree expected, a number of distressed properties still are winding through the system and selling on a one-off basis, said Jan Freitag, senior vice president of STR Global, a lodging research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Johnson is the founder of Black Entertainment Television, a cable network he sold to <span class="companylink">Viacom Inc</span>. in 2001 for $3 billion. In recent years, Mr. Johnson began investing in hotels. He controlled the predecessor company that acquired the La Guardia Marriott. The property was part of the portfolio owned by RLJ Lodging when it went public in the spring 2011.Thomas J. Baltimore Jr., chief executive of RLJ Lodging, said the La Guardia property had been hurt by the recession, but that its fate was no longer relevant to RLJ Lodging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of the company, which has a portfolio of over 140 hotels in 21 states and the District of Columbia, closed at $20.37 Monday, 13% above the $18 its shares priced at when it went public in May 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time of the hotel acquisition, Mr. Johnson's company said it planned to spend about $11.5 million renovating the property and focusing on upgrading its guest rooms. But the outlook for the property and the travel market quickly dimmed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the La Guardia Marriott's business is dependent on business travelers, though it also sees a surge in business every summer from the U.S. Open tennis championship held annually at the nearby Flushing Meadows-Corona Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gordon said he hopes to use his experience managing hotels to improve operations at the La Guardia property. Mr. Gordon formed Rubicon in 2011 after stepping down from his post as president of <span class="companylink">Morgans Hotel Group Co</span>. of New York, a publicly traded New York hotel group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It may not be the center of the universe like Manhattan, but this is one of the premier hotels in Queens," said Mr. Gordon.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll's City Living division, which has 10 condo developments under way in New York City, is scheduled to announce on Wednesday its first condo development in the Washington area. Toll also is considering developing in Miami, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle and Vancouver, British Columbia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are a number of markets where they can enter and have impact that are a logical extension for their condo product," said Robert Curran, a home-building analyst with Fitch Ratings. "This is a gem of a business for Toll."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condo construction is highly fragmented, with a number of small companies with a minor presence. But if Toll's expansion plans play out, it could be one of a handful of national companies that have become brand names in the condominium world, alongside <span class="companylink">Trump Organization</span>, which has built 10,000 condos in New York and has 5,000 in other cities; New York's Related Cos., which has developed more than 2,700 units in New York; and Related Group in Miami, which has built about 22,000 units, mostly in Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having a name brand is "a huge help when we're selling because people have heard of us," said David Von Spreckelsen, president of Toll's New York City Living division. This "is something that distinguishes us" from other developers, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strategy is to cater to younger professional buyers eschewing the large suburban home and to aging baby boomers, including many who purchased Toll homes in the past and now are ready for a smaller residence or a second home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Baby boomers are downsizing and getting tired of mowing the lawn, and many are looking for a place where they don't have to drive for everything," said Christopher Leinberger, a Washington urban land-use strategist and partner in developer Arcadia Land Co. "The home builders in this country have been slow in getting into this market, but once they do, they find that it is a large market with pent-up demand."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll, based in Horsham, Pa., started its City Living brand just as the housing bubble was inflating in 2003, when it purchased Manhattan Building Co., a Hoboken, N.J.-based condo builder. It entered Philadelphia in 2005 and opened its first Manhattan tower in 2006. City Living now makes up about 10% of company revenue by units delivered and could eventually rise as high as 15%, said the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For builders, going vertical is vastly different from building individual houses. Land in cities is pricey, competition can be fierce for the best-located spots and the approvals process can be time-consuming. Building condos also takes longer than a single-family home, leaving the developer at risk should the market sour before completion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the payoff can be worth the risk. The Touraine, a high-end development being built by Toll on Manhattan's Upper East Side, sold 21 of its 22 units in less than six months with an average selling price of more than $4 million, the company said. That price, more than $2,500 a square foot, is well above Toll's fourth-quarter average unit selling price of $582,000. The first residents are expected to move in this spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all developments were so easy. In 2009, a weak market forced Toll to cut prices by 25% on three-bedroom units at its massive 450-unit Northside Piers in Brooklyn, N.Y.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll now focuses on smaller developments that contain about 100 units. In December, Toll paid $121 million for two Manhattan parcels, one in Midtown and one in SoHo. These could total about 200 new condos, though plans aren't finalized. Last year, Toll paid $30 million for two town homes on Park Avenue that it is razing and building 11 condos expected to command higher prices than the Touraine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first development in the Washington area will be located in downtown Bethesda, Md., and will include a seven-story building with 60 luxury condos. Construction should start this fall and sales will begin in spring 2014, said Stephen Alfandre, the area's director of acquisitions for the City Living division.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condo sales in the Washington-area market increased nearly 30% from the prior year, while prices of new units climbed 3.7%, according to Delta Associates, a real-estate research and consulting firm. Across the market, the number of new, available condos for sale has fallen to the lowest number since Delta started keeping track in 2003.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>., the third-largest U.S. home builder by sales, said Tuesday that it is branching out into rental housing, in a bid to capitalize on rising rents and growing demand for apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lennar, which also reported sharply higher fiscal fourth-quarter earnings, said its <span class="companylink">Lennar Multifamily Investors</span> subsidiary is "maturing into the construction phase," with projects valued at more than $1 billion in its pipeline over the next three years. They include 6,500 rental apartments, 3,000 of which will be started this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lennar Chief Executive Stuart Miller said on an earnings conference call Tuesday that despite improvements in the housing market, he expects the recovery to be "moderated" by tightness in the mortgage market, which will continue to drive families into the rental market, rather than the home-buying market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There will consistently be a large group of people who simply can't buy a home, and won't buy a home, and are looking for rentals," Mr. Miller said. The new rental business "inserts Lennar's name into the homes of thousands of prospective home buyers prior to their first home purchase," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If its plans succeed, Lennar would be the first of the major builders known for suburban tract homes to focus on rental housing as a profit driver. Other large home builders, including <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Beazer Homes USA Inc</span>., have invested in rental housing, but to a much smaller extent. The construction of apartment buildings is dominated by a mix of large real-estate trusts and mom-and-pop landlords.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past year, Lennar has been outlining its approach to rental housing in private meetings with investors, which involves forming partnerships with other investors so that Lennar can build apartments with as little of its own capital as possible, according to one person who attended an investor meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday's conference call, Lennar said it had already begun construction of its first two multifamily rental projects: a $32 million partnership with Prudential Real Estate Partners to build 264 garden apartments in Johns Creek, Ga., an upscale Atlanta suburb, and another with private-equity firm <span class="companylink">Carlyle Group</span> to build a $36 million, 316-unit cluster of four-story apartments in Jacksonville, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lennar says most of its rental apartments will be low- or midrise projects, although the company is considering some high-rise development. Its multifamily operation has opened offices in Atlanta; Charlotte, N.C.; Chicago; Dallas; Santa Barbara and Orange County, Calif.; San Francisco, Seattle and Miami. Over the past year, Lennar has bought land for apartment projects in Seattle, Charlotte and Naperville, Ill., outside of Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Despite a market rebound in the for-sale housing market, demand for rentals has accelerated, while supply has remained constrained," said Rick Beckwitt, Lennar's president. "It's easier to build a multifamily complex than it is to actually build homes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the pool of renters continued to grow, there were 242,000 new apartment units under construction in the U.S. in November, up from the lull in 2008 and 2010 but still well below the 340,000-a-month average during the 2000s, according to the Census Bureau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That supply-and-demand imbalance means that rents will likely continue to grow, albeit at a slower pace than in the past year. Apartment rents rose 3.8% in 2012, up from 2.4% in 2011 and 2.3% in 2010, according to real-estate research firm <span class="companylink">Reis, Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the quarter ended Nov. 30, Lennar reported a profit of $124.3 million, or 56 cents a share, up from $30.3 million, or 16 cents a share, a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue jumped 42% to $1.35 billion amid a strong performance from the company's home-building and financial-services segments. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had forecast earnings of 44 cents on revenue of $1.31 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lennar's gross margin on home sales widened to 23.5% from 19.4%. New home deliveries increased 32% to 4,443 homes. The average selling price of homes delivered rose 7.4% to $261,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders jumped 32% to 3,983 homes, and the company's backlog, an indication of future business, grew 87% to 4,053 homes.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Carmel Melouney </div><div>799 words</div><div>14 January 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A20</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Schools and universities have chalked up a sharp expansion in their New York space needs in recent years, driven in part by more families populating Lower Manhattan, a new report says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2005, the footprint of the education sector in the Manhattan office-leasing market has increased 47%, to 8.1 million square feet from 5.5 million square feet as of November, according to research by brokerage firm CBRE.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the educational-leasing activity has been concentrated in the Midtown South and downtown areas, reflecting changing demographics as more families move to neighborhoods that previously saw mostly commercial activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cheaper rents following the economic downtown have also helped education-sector tenants to pick up space in the tight office market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As far as our records go back, which is to the 1970s, there has never been an increase like this [in educational leasing], and it's directly related to the increase in population growth and the increase in value of properties," said CBRE Executive Vice President Bruce Surry, who worked with a team on the firm's "Taking the Office Market to School" report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Surry said increases in postrecession availability rates and decreases in asking rents in parts of Midtown South and downtown greatly helped education-sector tenants. Another factor that has aided education tenants is the changed attitude of landlords in the wake of the downturn, with owners being more amenable to the unique requirements of schools and universities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Prices will restrict and inhibit options for education tenants," according to Mr. Surry. "And most schools sign 15- to 20-year leases."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The limited supply of buildings in Manhattan that can accommodate the many requirements of a school is also a hurdle. "There aren't that many suitable buildings available -- that's the challenge," he said,</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York has the largest public-school system in the nation, with nearly 1.1 million students in more than 1,700 schools, as well as 76 universities and colleges, more than any other U.S. city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The downtown and Midtown South areas have been particularly fertile ground for education tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New leases signed in recent years include Avenues: The World School taking up 240,000 square feet at 259 10th Ave. in 2010; <span class="companylink">City University of New York</span> signing up for 137,000 square feet at 395 Hudson St. in 2010; and <span class="companylink">Leman Manhattan Preparatory School</span> leasing 204,000 square feet at 25 Broadway in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lease renewals have included <span class="companylink">CUNY</span> further committing to 198,000 square feet at 555 W. 57th St. in 2009 and Technical Career Institute doing so in 2012 for 138,000 square feet at 320 W. 31st St.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of residential units in lower Manhattan almost doubled between 2000 and 2010 to more than 27,800 units, and the number of children aged 14 and under doubled in 2012 from 2000, to more than 5,200.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are good public schools in lower Manhattan, but not enough to accommodate all the students, and not enough independent schools," said Mac Gamse, chief executive of Meritas International Family of Schools, which owns the <span class="companylink">Leman Manhattan Preparatory School</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is such a vibrant, fast-growing area, and the highest birthrates in New York are in lower Manhattan," he said. "The shifting demographics are a critical piece of us wanting to be in lower Manhattan."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The independent school accommodates fifth- to 12th-grade students in the Broadway building, where it has a gym and a swimming pool. "We have space and phenomenal views -- our art spaces overlook the Statue of Liberty," Mr. Gamse said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Surry, who worked on the Leman Manhattan deal, said the downtown location "has tremendous access to transport for students." Students at the school, where day-student tuition is around $36,400, commute from Brooklyn, Jersey City, the Upper East and West sides, Queens and lower Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CUNY spokesman Michael Arena said the space the university took up on Hudson Street was formerly a data center for Thomson Reuters. "[It] was ideal for relocating our university data center," formerly situated in smaller quarters at 57th Street and 11th Avenue, Mr. Arena said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The education sector's footprint in New York is set to increase further, with <span class="companylink">New York University</span>'s planned expansion and <span class="companylink">Columbia University</span>'s construction of a $6.3 billion satellite campus in Manhattanville. The Hudson Yards development project includes 120,000 square feet of space set aside for school use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a dramatic positive for the city on every level," Mr. Surry said of the education sector's recent growth in New York.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The late architect Charles Gwathmey was not a winner of the Pritzker Architecture Prize. A Commercial Property article on Monday incorrectly identified him as a Pritzker winner.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cooper Square, the chaotic, plaza-like arrangement of streets including Astor Place, Third and Fourth avenues and Lafayette Street that effectively divides the East from the West Village, has long been a playground for architects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The famed New York industrialist Peter Cooper, for whom the square is named, built Cooper Union there in the 1850s to encourage innovation in art, engineering and, yes, architecture. Its original home, the Foundation Building, designed by architect Frederick Peterson, was the first in New York to use steel beams in its frame. In the last 10 years, firms controlled by two Pritzker Prize winners -- Charles Gwathmey and Thom Mayne -- have built glassy contemporary buildings nearby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, developer Edward J. Minskoff is erecting the square's most dramatic building yet, a 13-story mixed-use office and educational building at 51 Astor Place designed by another Pritzker winner, Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki. It will dominate the square visually and serve as a centerpiece of an area that has become a petri dish of architectural experimentation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Maki design succeeds on several major counts, but fails on others. As a neighborhood signpost -- a building perched on the divide between the energetic grime of the East Village and the gentrified civility of the West Village -- Mr. Minskoff's building is perfectly suited. The building's west flank, which looks out over the square toward Broadway, will hold 90,000 square feet of office space and is nearing completion. It is a gloomy obelisk of black reflective glass, a nod to the type of office space favored these days by tech companies, hedge funds and defense contractors. The low- and mid-rise sections on the east portion of the building, which will hold classrooms, are done in lighter-colored glass and aluminum, and include a triangular plaza facing the college dive bars across Third Avenue. The difference between the two portions of the building is pronounced: The west is all business, the east more conducive to learning and socializing, and more in accord with the residential character of the neighborhood it faces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another count in the building's favor is that it will likely attract high-quality (and high-paying) office tenants. The building is situated at the junction of three subway lines, and is a few blocks from four more, and by virtue of its location at the nexus of the city's college-age universe, it should be a magnet for tenants in New York's fast-growing tech sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Companies today in the field of tech, they're very young. They do not want to live or work above 14th Street," Mr. Minskoff said during an interview recently at his Midtown offices. "This was a classic case of an opportunity to take a wonderful site and really put a special building there. It's dramatic, it's great-looking, it fits in to the neighborhood, it's not overbearing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as an architectural statement, the Maki-designed building is not nearly strong enough to live up to Cooper Square's legacy of edgy design. It's certainly not strong enough to hold the square's center together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building is the sum of three main sculptural forms: the trapezoidal, dark-glass-clad office space abuts two shapes composed in the lighter glass: a highly regular, light-colored box with a triangular mid-rise piece on top of it. From certain angles, the building will look geological, resembling a pile of jutting, crystalline fragments. From others, it is frustratingly regular-looking and dry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compare that to some of the other buildings in the area. Thom Mayne's Cooper Union academic building on the Bowery, finished a few hundred yards away in 2009, is a bold, formally outre version of a modified box dressed in unfamiliar-looking metal screening -- a decadent, experimental object that surely speaks to the aspirations of the architecture students up the street. Charles Gwathmey's curvaceous condo tower, while a tasteless remnant of 1980s-era design excess, still manages to speak loudly from its perch on he southwest side of Cooper Square.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Maki's building, unfortunately, doesn't say much of anything at all, beyond advertising its cool, no-nonsense sense of propriety as an office space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not entirely the designer's fault. When Mr. Minskoff negotiated a $97 million, 99-year lease for the building's site, it was already subject to a highly prescriptive land-use plan from New York's Department of City Planning, which gave an outline of everything from size to the general shape to which Mr. Maki's design had to conform. Upon seeing the area's Uniform Land Use Review Procedure, Mr. Maki's team immediately made a 3-D mock-up of everything the city was asking for. Two-dimensional images of the model provided by Mr. Maki's office to The Wall Street Journal do not look all that much different from the final design of 51 Astor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary Kamemoto, the Maki and Associates director who oversaw the Cooper Square project, admits that the city's guidelines were limiting, but says he doesn't think that was a bad thing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The common perception when you get a document like that is to kind of receive it in a very negative way, that it's limiting, or overly prescriptive, or it might tie your hands," Mr. Kamemoto said during an interview. "But when we put this massing into the site model we made, we essentially embraced it, and decided that it provides a very good scale to its context. We developed a strong appreciation for the guidelines, and that translated into us believing that the project had some very real potential. We felt that our duty, or our assignment, should be how to make the building form to be even better."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Minskoff's firm has focused on the building's strong geometric shapes -- even developing a marketing logo that reduces the building to its three main forms -- and its distinctiveness in the context of the East Village's gritty walk-ups and bare-bones commercial spaces as proof of the building's exciting design.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When I moved here, there were buildings that were not known by their addresses. Lever House, the GM building, the Pan-Am building. I think 51 Astor Place has the opportunity to go down in history as to be referred to by the name of its tenants," Mr. Minskoff says, though he has declined to name any potential tenants with whom he is in discussions. "I don't like to build mediocre boxes. I want to build buildings that will be great on year 1 and great on year 30."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The structure going up at 51 Astor should not be viewed as mediocre, but it's a far cry from the type of ground-breaking design that earns a place in the pantheon of the city's name-brand buildings.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Eliot Brown </div><div>793 words</div><div>14 January 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surge in apartment rents since the downturn has sparked development across the country. But tenants pinched by rising rents shouldn't expect relief soon from the new apartments for a simple reason: Demand is likely to outpace supply for some time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While apartment construction has picked up from its lethargic pace in 2009 and 2010, today's level is still below historical norms. There were 242,000 apartment units -- the vast majority of which were rentals, not condominiums -- under construction in November, below the roughly 340,000-a-month average during the 2000s, according to the Census Bureau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits have recently risen to normal levels, with 24,200 units authorized in November. But while the pool of renters continues to grow, most apartments in the pipeline today won't be available for occupancy until 2014 or 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This supply-and-demand imbalance means apartment buildings are hot properties for commercial landlords. Although many analysts expect the rate of rent growth to slow, apartments are still likely to fare better than other classes of commercial property, like office buildings and stores, which are struggling with lackluster demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the strength of the rental market underscores some limitations of the recovery among the for-sale housing market. Rising values are encouraging some potential buyers but stringent lending terms and slow income growth are keeping many others out of the mortgage market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists expect the homeownership rate to stay around its current 65.5% level for at least the next few years, if not the long term. That is well below the 69.2% peak of the housing bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing recovery is not affecting apartments at the ground level," said Alexander Goldfarb, a real-estate analyst at <span class="companylink">Sandler O'Neill &amp; Partners</span>. "Rents are going to keep going up."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment market started to rebound from the recession in 2010. Occupancies and rents have increased thanks to demand from people who lost their homes in foreclosures or people unable to buy homes because of weak credit or lost jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rents grew 3.8% in 2012, up from 2.4% in 2011 and 2.3% in 2010, according to real-estate research service <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>. The firm projects annual increases of 4% to 4.5% through 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, rents can't sustain their current growth rate forever, especially in a weak economy. Already, there are signs of resistance in cities like New York, where some tenants can't afford to renew leases at ever-climbing rents. That is one reason why publicly traded apartment companies trailed the market last year after a strong performance earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the housing market's gradual recovery could spur more renters to become buyers, particularly in exurbs and some cities in the Southwest with affordable homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But demographics favor the rental market. After sliding for years, the number of new households established is up. The prime renter age group, 20 to 34 years old, is projected to grow by 552,000 to 65.7 million over the next two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, many new apartments have yet to hit the market. That is because banks and other lenders through much of 2011 and 2012 were wary of diving into the risky business of funding apartment construction just a few years after the real-estate bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Eighteen months ago, lots and lots of people knew multifamily was the asset class to be in, but there were still plenty of banks that were skittish," said Willy Walker, chief executive of the apartment-focused lender <span class="companylink">Walker &amp; Dunlop Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Development hasn't been uniform across the country. Many in the sector are watching areas such as Washington, D.C., and Seattle, which both saw an early wave of new development that could flood those markets. This year, Reis said, Washington will see 2,977 units completed, the most in decades. Seattle is slated to have 5,166 new units, up from the roughly 2,000 a year for much of the past decade. Many expect the new supply will ease rent pressure there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I do think you'll start to see year-over-year rent growth start to subside," said Scott Matthews, an executive who oversees development at <span class="companylink">Vulcan Inc</span>., a Seattle company owned by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. Vulcan started two apartment buildings with a total of 460 units in the city last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere in the country, it is a different story. Although builders are rushing to break ground, demand continues to outstrip supply, positioning 2013 to resemble 2012.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Joann S. Lublin </div><div>1217 words</div><div>11 January 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rob and Julia Israch won a fierce bidding war for a three-bedroom townhouse in Mountain View, Calif., late last year even though their $750,000 offer -- while $92,000 above the asking price -- was topped by 11 rivals and was several thousand dollars below the highest bid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A key reason: The seller, software engineer Lev Stesin, was moved by a letter in which the Israchs said they worked in the technology industry and explained how the home's spacious layout would be perfect given the imminent arrival of their first child. Among other things, the townhouse has three bathrooms, a wood-burning fireplace and a roomy backyard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I felt very comfortable with these people," said Mr. Stesin, himself the father of a toddler. "I really wanted this place to go to somebody in a similar situation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an echo of the last housing boom, ardent pitch letters from eager home buyers are popping up again in hot U.S. real-estate markets like Silicon Valley, Seattle, San Diego, suburban Chicago and Washington, D.C., housing economists and real-estate brokers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The heartfelt missives, often accompanied by personal photos, aim to create an emotional bond that can give their writers an edge -- especially in situations where multiple bidders are vying for the same house. And the reappearance of buyer pitches, also known as love letters, offers further evidence that the housing market is rebounding after a five-year slump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year is likely to have been the first since 2006 in which home prices rose. Meanwhile, inventory is tight. There were just 2.14 million existing homes for sale at the end of October, down about 22% from a year ago to the lowest level in a decade, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> estimates. Sales of existing homes in November rose 14.5% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market has gotten so crazy that money alone doesn't talk," explained Glenn Kelman, chief executive of Redfin, a real-estate brokerage that operates in 19 markets. In 2012, 70% of the offers handled by Redfin agents faced competing bids. In Silicon Valley, the figure was 95%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's really a seller's market," said Mrs. Israch, a Facebook account manager. "This market is ridiculous." She and her husband, a senior manager at NetSuite, submitted their first pitch letter while bidding for a different Mountain View townhouse last fall. They lost that one, outbid by seven of the 11 other would-be buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A pitch letter worked during Sandy S. Kuo and Syed Ahmad's third attempt to buy a home in nearby Saratoga, Calif. The <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> and <span class="companylink">International Business Machines</span> managers began house hunting in earnest after their July wedding. They had written letters unsuccessfully before. This time, they went into more detail about why they felt at home in a three-bedroom ranch listed for about $1.05 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We imagined how we could set up the patio for BBQs, we discussed where our future baby's nursery could be," their two-page letter explained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary Barnett, who was selling the house on behalf of his late mother, said the letter "was very nicely done." But with a $1.13 million bid, he said, "they also had the best offer." The sale closed Nov. 15.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Extra effort involving a pitch letter paid off for Jonathan Duryee, a civilian management trainee for the <span class="companylink">U.S. Navy</span>. He initially failed to snag a four-bedroom home in San Diego last October despite sending the seller a letter with four pictures of himself, his wife Nancy and their 10-month-old son. After the original buyer withdrew, he emailed the seller a new photo of his baby and two dogs around a handwritten sign that read: "We would love a big yard!"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It really made me try to put these kids into the house," said Scott Pursell, a veteran builder who was selling the home, which he acquired as a rental property 20 years ago. He even rejected an all-cash offer $25,000 below the Duryees' $550,000 bid for the $549,900 dwelling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pitch letters prove particularly effective when they create a personal connection with longtime occupants. Last fall, Judy Blankenburg and her sister decided to sell their three-bedroom childhood residence in Los Altos, another Silicon Valley community. Their mother, who died in July, had called it home for 68 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My sister and I had a huge emotional attachment to that house," said Ms. Blankenburg, a retired chemical analyst. "We didn't want it torn down."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sisters accepted a bid that came in about $200,000 above their $1.8 million asking price from a Los Altos couple keen to raise their three daughters on a quieter street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"From the majestic trees and the lush foliage in the front and backyards to the living room with high ceiling made of knotty pine, your home is filled with charm," the Sastry family said in their letter. They moved in Dec. 15.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Blankenburg said her parents, avid gardeners, would have been pleased by the buyers' fondness for trees. But she realizes the letter isn't a commitment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Three months from now, I may drive by and find they tore [the house] down," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kantha Sastry said she and her husband don't know whether they might one day tear down the 1938 home. But some Silicon Valley brokers have seen that scenario play out before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few years ago, the owners of an older Los Altos home got more than 21 offers and picked the one from a woman who also submitted a love letter from her dog, said Kathy Bridgman, an Alain Pinel Realtors agent who represented the sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"She won't touch a thing," promised the letter, signed with a paw print. "I will be able to play in the yard."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After closing, the buyer immediately tore down the home and built a bigger one.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sanette Tanaka  </div><div>973 words</div><div>11 January 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Turns out, a picture is worth thousands of dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding at least one photo to a residential-real-estate listing increases the final sale price by up to 3.9%, says Ken H. Johnson, an associate professor of finance at Florida International University's Hollo School of Real Estate. That can mean an extra $39,000 for a $1 million house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If I was selling, I would put every picture I could on the listing, at a ratio of four to five interior vs. one exterior," says Prof. Johnson. "We're talking about a few extra weeks in marketing time to get that 3% to 5% increase on a home. That's a good trade."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roughly 85% of the 4,077 houses studied by Prof. Johnson and co-authors Christopher Cain and Justin Benefield included a photo. Interior pictures were more effective than exterior shots, adding a 3.9% price bump vs. 1.9%. Although adding just one photo can result in these gains, Prof. Johnson estimates that each additional photo adds about $150 to $200 to the final sale price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But be prepared to wait for the payoff: Adding a photo increases the time to sell by 20.6%, meaning the house will stay on the market for an additional 16.5 days, on average, according to the study, "On the Relationship Between Property Price, Time-on-Market, and Photo Depictions in a Multiple Listing Service," published in the Journal of Real Estate Finance and Economics in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's because photos give consumers more information to consider, slowing the decision-making process, Prof. Johnson says. "You're getting an information overload. It's like offering kids a bunch of candy, and they can't decide which one to take," he says. But photos also ease uncertainty. Consumers who have a clear idea of what they are buying are willing to pay more and are ultimately more satisfied with the sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prof. Johnson's research does not differentiate between professional photos and amateur shots, but says he thinks professionally shot photos are much more effective.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Debra Stotts, senior vice president and associate broker at Town Residential in New York City, recently had one of her listings at Trump World Tower at 845 United Nations Plaza reshot to better show off the design, size and views.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To do that, Manhattan-based photographer Michael Weinstein looked for what he calls the single "wow photo" to open the listing. Usually, it's the living room, but in this case, Mr. Weinstein says he shot the dining room opening into the living room to emphasize spaciousness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weinstein, owner of MW Studio, shares some tips that homeowners and brokers can consider when working on listings. First, he takes into account which direction the windows face and when the natural light will best accentuate the space. Generally, earlier in the day gives a clear, bright light, while later in the day casts a warm glow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He usually shoots from the corner of a room with a wide-angle zoom lens to depict the room at its largest. He also positions the camera to highlight the unique elements of a home, whether that's floor-to-ceiling windows, generous hallways or an elegant foyer. Mr. Weinstein charges on a per shot basis at roughly $250 to $1,500 per real-estate shoot, depending on the number of photos used.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evan Joseph, another Manhattan-based photographer, will sometimes use up to eight lenses in a single shoot. "I look for the camera angle that makes a room open up, maybe being closer to the windows or shooting upward. Sometimes you need to find the spot where the view is the most fantastic, and that spot might be in the middle of a room or on a couch," he says. Mr. Joseph, owner of Evan Joseph Images, says he charges between $600 and $1,500 for high-end shoots of resale homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both photographers agree natural light is best. But in the case of a cloudy day, Mr. Joseph comes to shoots armed with plenty of studio lighting. Mr. Weinstein skips the lighting but will occasionally turn on interior lamps to add warmth -- though that can give the impression that a room is naturally dark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the most part, Mr. Weinstein says, touch-ups happen after the shoot with digital photo editing. A cloudy, overcast view can be brightened to show clear blue, sunny skies. Fireplaces are dressed up with fires. He also removes anything unsightly, like wires, scuff marks on walls, vents, even air-conditioners. He adjusts the color as well to accentuate certain features in the homes. "We'll warm up the floors or warm up the colors of the walls. It's very subtle, but it can be very effective," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Especially time-consuming is removing multiple or large elements, like scaffolding seen through a window or a delivery truck obscuring the front, Mr. Joseph says. "People think Photoshop has a magic 'Remove This' button, but you have to reimagine, re-create and reassemble the thing that I'm removing," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One broker notes that retouching shouldn't misrepresent the space. "Even if a space needs a lot of work, I would show the flaws in the images so people know what they're getting into," says Patty LaRocco, senior vice president and associate broker at Town Residential.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Photos have to walk the fine line of showing off a space's character without making the home seem too personalized, Ms. LaRocco says. "Materials, light and volume are really what I'm after," she says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TOKYO -- <span class="companylink">Sony Corp</span>. is looking to sell one of its main buildings in Tokyo, barely two years after it was completed, as the company accelerates shedding nonessential assets to raise cash, a person with knowledge of the proposed sale said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Japanese consumer-electronics company is considering selling the <span class="companylink">Sony</span> City Osaki building for about 100 billion yen to 130 billion yen, or roughly $1 billion to $1.5 billion, the person said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Completed in 2011 and located in one of Tokyo's main office areas, the 124,000-square-meter, 25-story building houses around 5,000 employees in television, audio and other divisions. Employees would be expected to stay at the location after the sale since the potential buyer would be likely to lease the building to <span class="companylink">Sony</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weakened by years of losses and a sharp decline for its core consumer-electronics segment, <span class="companylink">Sony</span> needs to bolster its finances to compete with leaner rivals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company has reshaped its business portfolio under Chief Executive Kazuo Hirai, selling its chemical products business and unwinding a liquid-crystal-display joint venture with <span class="companylink">Sharp Corp</span>. <span class="companylink">Sony</span> also formed a capital tie-up with medical-equipment maker <span class="companylink">Olympus Corp</span>. <span class="companylink">Sony</span> is considering selling its rechargeable-battery business, people familiar with the company's thinking said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company declined to comment on whether it would sell the <span class="companylink">Sony</span> City Osaki building. At least one investment fund said it had been notified about a potential sale of the building about a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Sony</span> has said it was considering selling its U.S. headquarters in New York. The company in 2006 sold its former head office in Tokyo and later, its main building in Berlin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite slim prospects for sharp rises in property prices, interest among foreign investors in Japanese real estate has been increasing recently, in part because of attractive annual returns. Office vacancy rates in Tokyo have started to decline in recent months, according to brokers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Apple</span>'s Turnover Is Tasty</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Long-Term Business</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Apple</span> has never shied away from cannibalizing its own business, typically with good results. With a new, lower-priced iPhone, it can build on that track record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company is said to be working on such a device. The reason: While its flagship iPhone remains a top seller among high-value mobile subscribers world-wide, the company has mostly left the lower end of the market to cheaper devices from <span class="companylink">Samsung</span> and a handful of others running <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s Android mobile operating system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the year through September, <span class="companylink">Apple</span>'s share of world-wide smartphone unit sales was 20%. That was versus a 63% share for Android, estimates Strategy Analytics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">True, <span class="companylink">Apple</span> now keeps older iPhone versions on the market and sells them cheaper -- an iPhone 4 is available free in the U.S. today. But that is only because carriers are still willing to subsidize the cost of the device in exchange for subscribers signing lucrative two-year contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the world's consumers aren't so valuable, though. Consequently, carriers aren't willing to subsidize the cost of high-end devices for them. Average revenue for a U.S. subscriber was roughly $46 a month in 2012, according to Strategy Analytics, compared with about $10 a month in China. To attract lower-value subscribers, <span class="companylink">Apple</span> needs to offer truly inexpensive devices. Even as such a move risks cutting into <span class="companylink">Apple</span>'s stellar gross margins from iPhone sales, the opportunity to attract more users to its platform may be more important in the long run. As incomes rise in China, for instance, many of those buying a cheaper iPhone today might graduate to more expensive iPhones later. Meanwhile, once on the <span class="companylink">Apple</span> platform, they also may be more inclined to other products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A clue to the potential impact on margins will come when <span class="companylink">Apple</span> later this month reports results for the quarter ending in December. This will be the first to include sales of the iPad Mini. <span class="companylink">Apple</span> offered the cheaper, smaller version of its flagship tablet for reasons similar to why it might release a cheap iPhone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question is whether the iPad Mini will have sold in high-enough numbers so that its total gross profit contribution offsets the fact that some buyers likely chose it over a more-profitable, full-size iPad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is more important for <span class="companylink">Apple</span> in the long run is bucking the historical handset trend where once-hot companies suddenly lose their mojo. Even if gross profit margins decline, the company should still have a good recurring business selling all manner of solidly profitable computing devices to those it has hooked onto the <span class="companylink">Apple</span> platform.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite justifiable worries over margins, investors should keep in mind that <span class="companylink">Apple</span> has traveled this road before. The successful iPod spawned smaller devices like the iPod Shuffle and iPod Nano. And while difficult to imagine today, many were concerned when the iPhone was launched in 2007 that it would harm sales of iPods, then <span class="companylink">Apple</span>'s leading product.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Better once again for <span class="companylink">Apple</span> to eat its own, and keep users on its platform, than let Android-based rivals steal the business out from under it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Rolfe Winkler</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's Not-So-Firm Ground</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's real-estate developers are starting 2013 on a more solid foundation. But cracks still could appear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property sales are on the rise -- up 31% year on year in November according to the official numbers, and with data pointing to further acceleration in December. That is driving an uptick in investment and commodity demand, which is positive for Chinese and global growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iron-ore imports hit a record in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For China's listed developers, the markets already have priced in the turnaround. Shares in Hong Kong-listed China Overseas Land &amp; Investment have risen 91% since the start of 2012. <span class="companylink">Greentown China Holdings</span>'s stock has run up more than 300%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That might be far enough. China's biggest developers have weathered almost three years of government controls on the property market better than expected. Debt levels rose, but have stabilized now. Margins came down from stratospheric levels, but have steadied between about 15% and 30% for most builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A shakeout of smaller rivals has enabled major developers to gain market share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there still is reason for caution. Capital Economics estimates that residential-real-estate completions hit 10.8 million units in 2012. They estimate that demand, driven by the movement of people into urban areas, first-time buyers, and the replacement of old property, will be about 10 million units a year for the next decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That supply-demand mismatch means that unsold apartment blocks ringing China's cities continue to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the market as a whole, there is enough property under construction to meet about five years of demand, up from 2.9 years in 2009, according to the official data. That is an overhang of supply that will weigh on prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suppliers to the sector also should be concerned. Capital Economics data suggest construction has to slow to match demand. Also, government efforts to control speculation have inspired a change in the mix of housing under construction away from luxury apartments and toward more modest dwellings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means even if the number of new apartments stays constant, the amount of steel and cement required to build them might fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's real-estate sector is enjoying a cyclical recovery that should buoy growth and commodity demand going into the first half of 2013. But the structural foundations remain far from solid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Tom Orlik</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gold Miners Face Unlucky '13</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gold has had a pedestrian start to the year. But, as has become the pattern, gold miners have had it worse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With gold prices treading water, investors could use some good news from miners. But two of the largest provided the opposite. <span class="companylink">Barrick Gold</span> said talks to sell its 74% stake in listed subsidiary <span class="companylink">African Barrick Gold</span> to state-owned China National Gold ended without a deal. Meanwhile, Goldcorp cut guidance for output but raised it for spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Barrick deal's collapse is a setback for the company's plans to reduce its leverage. Debt to equity at 53.4% is more than double the peer-group average, according to Morningstar estimates. In addition, the fact that a state-owned firm, which should enjoy relatively cheap financing, wouldn't pay what Barrick wanted casts doubt on the sector's ability to create value by slimming asset portfolios.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">African Barrick carries another burden: high costs. In the first nine months of 2012, Barrick's average cash cost per ounce was $584. But African Barrick's was $946 -- hence the desirability of cutting exposure to it. Overall, Barrick's cash cost jumped 31% year on year in that period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Goldcorp, meanwhile, says its "all-in sustaining cash cost," which includes maintenance capital expenditure, would likely rise 21.4% this year to more than $1,000 an ounce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compare those increases to gold itself. Analysts expect it to average $1,753 this year -- up just 5.2% from 2012 -- and fall the following two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gold miners spent 2012 trying to dig themselves out of this strategic dilemma, while investors notched up losses on their stocks. It doesn't look like 2013 will pan out much better.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason for optimism in the New Year is the housing market, which continues to heal despite the weak economic recovery. Case-Shiller, Lender Processing Services and other data trackers are reporting recoveries in many regions. Even more noteworthy is that the rebound is strongest in states that let lenders enforce contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We're referring to the difference between "nonjudicial" states that have streamlined foreclosure procedures and the 23 "judicial" states that force lenders to go to court to enforce mortgage contracts. Prices are stabilizing in the former but still faltering in much of the latter, which isn't surprising, except to politicians. Housing markets can't clear until lenders can foreclose on delinquent borrowers and prices fall far enough to attract buyers who can afford the mortgage payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Politicians and housing lobbyists decry nonjudicial foreclosure as unfair to borrowers, but every homeowner in any state has the right to challenge a foreclosure in court. The main difference is that in a judicial state the lender has to file a lawsuit to initiate a foreclosure, which can take months or years to settle depending on the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A state's economy, unemployment and regulations also play a role in foreclosure timelines, but the difference between judicial and nonjudicial states is stark. Lender Processing Services estimates the foreclosure inventory in judicial states is more than triple that of nonjudicial states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">The Mortgage Bankers Association</span> 's latest National Delinquency Survey, which ended September 30, showed that of the top five states with the highest share of loans in foreclosure, four were judicial: Florida (13.04%), New Jersey (8.87%), Illinois (6.83%) and New York (6.46%). The other was Nevada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Florida for instance had to rehire retired judges last year to help clear its foreclosure backlogs—and the courts are still struggling to keep up. According to RealtyTrac, it took on average 858 days to foreclose in the Sunshine State as of September 30, up from 224 days at the start of 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now consider what happens to home prices in these states. According to S&amp;P/Case-Shiller, over the previous 12 months that ended October 31, Miami home prices were up 8.5% but nonjudicial Phoenix home prices rose 21.7%. Nonjudicial Detroit saw home prices rise 10% versus judicial Chicago, where prices dropped 1.3%, and judicial New York, where prices are down 1.2% over the same period. There are exceptions, but this general trend is clear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a hard truth for politicians to admit, much less sell to their constituents. It's politically easier to enact new regulations or legislation to "protect" borrowers from foreclosure, as if they are doing everyone a favor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California has been a nonjudicial state, and the foreclosure pipeline has cleared faster than in many states. But the Golden State just enacted a new law that, as California's Attorney General Kamala Harris declared, will "give homeowners new rights as they work through the foreclosure process." She didn't say it will also slow the housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is that state foreclosure protections—combined with similar efforts by the Obama Administration—have taught borrowers it's okay to stay delinquent for months or years while fending off foreclosure. Lender Processing Services recorded 1.58 million mortgages that are 90 or more days delinquent, but not in foreclosure, as of the end of November 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of October 31, Lender Processing Services estimated seven out of 10 states with the biggest backlogs of noncurrent mortgages, which includes those that are 30 days or more delinquent, as well as loans in foreclosure, were judicial: Florida (19.8%), New Jersey (16.1%), New York (13.4%), Illinois (13.0%), Louisiana (12.8%), Maryland (12.6%) and Maine (12.4%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So politicians have ended up protecting some of the least responsible borrowers without any wider economic benefit, and at the expense of mortgage investors and lenders, who are paying for the free roof. Anyone remember former New York Governor David Paterson's 2009 boast that the state's antiforeclosure legislation was "a national model"?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today it takes on average 1,072 days, or almost three years, for a lender to foreclose on a delinquent borrower in the Empire State, according to RealtyTrac. A local lawyer lamented to us recently that foreclosures in Kings County (Brooklyn) can take as long as four years—even if they're unopposed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The larger lesson is that political interventions on behalf of delinquent borrowers have done more economic harm than good. Judicial states in particular should revert to nonjudicial status before the next housing bust. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie got the point when he signed a law in December that lets lenders expedite foreclosures on vacant and abandoned homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The time to act is when the market is recovering, and home prices are rising, because eventually there will be another housing bust.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan renters may have to give up some of their gripes and bragging rights over the ever-increasing rents they pay for the privilege of living there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new report shows that the average rent in Manhattan drifted down 5% since it hit a new peak in August, with the largest decreases recorded for smaller studio and one-bedroom apartments. The super-luxury market remained hot, however.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rental analysts said that despite the softening of many rents, the market remained very tight. They said it was likely to continue so in the coming year, with landlords expected to offer few concessions, as long as the local economy continued to recover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While rents declined slightly for most apartment categories," said Gary Malin, the president of brokerage Citi Habitats, "overall the city's rental market remained in the landlord's favor."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, the average Manhattan rent set a record of $3,461, after rising sharply through much of 2011 and 2012, and after soaring above the previous peak of $3,392 reached in 2007. But by December, that average fell to $3,284 a month, the lowest since March 2011, according to Citi Habitats. The vacancy rate in Manhattan apartment buildings was little changed in December, at 1.37%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rental market was driven higher in recent years by the unwillingness and inability of many renters to qualify for mortgages needed to buy co-ops and condominium after the financial downturn. But the high rents and falling mortgage rates led to a pickup in sales of smaller studio and one-bedrooms apartments. That has eased the demand for rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With many renters still unable to qualify for mortgages because of tight credit conditions, the effect of this shift will likely be limited, keeping the apartment market tight, said Jonathan Miller, an appraiser and president of Miller Samuel Inc., who released a monthly rental report for <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't see credit easing," Mr. Miller said. "There is still gong to be a pressure on rents. We are transitioning from rapidly rising rents, to modestly rising rents."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller's report, based on a different group of rentals than used in the Citi Habitats report, showed that the median Manhattan rent in December was 0.8% above the level of a year earlier. Studio, one-bedroom and two-bedroom rents were off slightly, while three-bedroom apartments were up 20%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Superstorm Sandy had the effect of strengthening some segments of the Manhattan market, brokers said. It cut the supply of rentals by hundreds of apartments and forced some storm victims to rent temporary or permanent apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As those buildings start to come back online, they will increase the supply of rentals available in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 2 Gold St., a 51-story complex with 837 apartments, has been shut down since Sandy. Since then, more than 200 tenants have either given up their apartments or asked for their deposits back, according to TF Cornerstone, which owns the building. With repairs now due to be completed before March 1, many of these apartments will soon come back on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There will be a lot of people moving downtown," said Mark Menendez, director of rentals in Manhattan at <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lior Blik, who runs a health-care technology company, NITHealth, was forced out of a two-bedroom apartment at 2 Gold St. by the storm and planned to move out permanently. But he is still staying at a hotel and now plans to return when the building reopens. He said that other apartments he found that were similar to the one he rented for about $5,000 a month were now too expensive, at $7,000 or $8,000 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the top end of the market, rents soared in December. The Elliman report said that "super-luxury" rents -- the most expensive 5% of all rentals -- were up an average of 39.6% in December from a year earlier. The median rent was up 22%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Itzy Garay, a leasing director at Town Residential, said that both Sandy and the rush by home sellers to close deals in December before tax laws changed were factors. At 165 Charles St., a glass tower facing the Hudson River in the West Village, a two-bedroom apartment listed last month by Bill Kowalczuk, a Town broker, rented at the end of December for the full asking price of $27,500, far more than similar apartments rented for a few years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were three competing offers. One was by a renter unable to move into a rental building in TriBeCa that was storm-damaged; another had just sold an apartment to meet the tax deadline; and the third was an renter from out of town. The renter displaced by Sandy got the lease.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadians are coming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pension funds north of the border have poured about $9 billion into U.S. commercial real estate in the past three years, after largely steering clear of owning hotels, office buildings and apartments in the U.S. before then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While there are only a handful of big funds that are active abroad, they are having a disproportionate impact on the U.S. market by funding ambitious plans that domestic investors have been afraid to touch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadians funds see value in the U.S. as they expand beyond their own overheated property market. And, since the Canadian market wasn't hit as badly as the U.S. during the financial downturn, these pension funds are less gun shy about putting money to work in riskier projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Ivanhoe Cambridge</span>, the real-estate investor for <span class="companylink">Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec</span>, in May said it was investing $300 million to build a 45-story office tower in the West Loop of downtown Chicago. When completed, the 900,000-square-foot project will be the largest-size new property development in five years in that city at a time when no other major office projects are underway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Oxford Properties</span>, the real-estate investor for the <span class="companylink">Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System</span>, is joining up with New York developer Related Cos. on Hudson Yards, a massive $15 billion residential and commercial project on Manhattan's West Side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oxford has about $20 billion in property investments, primarily in Canada, but is ramping up quickly in the U.S. It has invested $1.5 billion in U.S. real estate and says it expects that to rise to $5 billion by 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, Oxford announced that it is part of a joint venture to build a $450 million project in Washington, with 620,000 square feet of office space, plus ground-floor retail and an atrium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The majority of institutional investors would say the U.S. is No. 1 on their list today," says William Tresham, president of global investments for <span class="companylink">Ivanhoe Cambridge</span>. "People are concerned where Europe is heading. Asian markets aren't well understood. Canadian assets are around an all-time high."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian commercial-property prices fell during the financial crisis but not as sharply as in the U.S., says Ross Moore, head of Canadian research at <span class="companylink">CBRE Group Inc</span>. Canadian values are now close to record levels seen in 2007. Investment volume, unlike in the U.S., also is hovering near peak levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That hyperventilating market has some worried about another correction. It is one reason why Canadian fund managers say they are more comfortable with the risks associated with new development abroad. "If we have to develop new projects to get returns, we're comfortable with that risk," says Neil Jacob, head of the U.S. region for Oxford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian investment spree offers a contrast to many large U.S. public pension funds, which have retreated after starting a decade ago to move further out on the risk spectrum. Many of those speculative bets blew up when the property bubble burst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">California Public Employees' Retirement System</span>, the largest U.S. public pension with about $250 billion in assets, saw the value of its real-estate portfolio halved for the year ending in June 2009. Since then, Calpers has favored safer property investments, such as fully leased office buildings that eliminate the risk of finding new tenants. Its returns bounced back a bit, rising to around 14.3% for the year ending in June, to bring its property assets to around $21 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other large funds, from the Ohio Public Employees' Retirement System to <span class="companylink">New York State Common Retirement Fund</span>, also have been turning their emphasis toward the same conservative property investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But during the crisis, many of the larger Canadian pension plans had most of their real-estate exposure in their own backyard, where property prices proved more stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The danger is that some of these new developments never get completed, or end up costing more than anticipated, cutting into income. If the U.S. economy goes into another tailspin, the Canadian funds could find themselves licking their wounds like the large U.S. pension funds did in 2008 and 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That certainly is a risk they are taking," says Christian Busken, a real-estate analyst for Cincinnati-based consulting firm, Fund Evaluation Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While most Canadian pension funds have scant history with direct U.S. real-estate development before the financial crisis, other Canadian property investors have had a mixed track record over the years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd</span>., a Toronto-based real-estate company controlled by the Reichmann family, became one of the largest property owners and developers in U.S. during the 1980s, only to lose billions of dollars when the commercial real-estate industry collapsed in the early 1990s. Forced to seek bankruptcy protection, the Canadian company eventually had to give up many of its properties, including Manhattan's World Financial Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the current risk-averse U.S. market, Canadian funds are playing a big role in getting projects going that might otherwise have stalled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We definitely canvassed the globe in 2010, and it was apparent that the Canadians were ready to step up and understood the risk and I think the rest of the world hadn't got there yet," says Jay Cross, an executive at Related Cos. who oversees the Hudson Yards project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The largest Canadian funds rival their U.S. counterparts in size. The Canada Pension Plan, one of the country's largest retirement systems, has $170 billion under management, while Caisse de depot has $159 billion.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Tishman Cuts the 'Financial Engineering' --- After Mishaps During the Boom Years, Firm Is Back Boosting Its Portfolio, Especially Overseas, but Is Using Less Debt</span>
</div><div class="author">By Eliot Brown </div><div>879 words</div><div>9 January 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three years ago, <span class="companylink">Tishman Speyer Properties LP</span> became the reluctant face of the real-estate bust when it agreed to surrender to creditors an 11,200-unit apartment complex in Manhattan, wiping out $3.3 billion of investors' money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, the company has been a case study in how to rebound in the forgiving commercial-property sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tishman Speyer has increased the portfolio of property that it controls to more than $34 billion, from $29 billion in 2010, and has more than 12 million square feet under development, the vast majority overseas. The company, which makes most of its investments from funds or with partners, has raised nearly $4.5 billion in that time frame for deals and funds, according to Rob Speyer, who runs the New York-based company with his father, Jerry Speyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the company has clearly learned some lessons from ill-fated deals during the boom years. Most notably, it no longer relies as heavily on lenders' money to pay top prices for premium office towers and apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, in its infamous 2006 Manhattan apartment investment -- the Stuyvesant Town/Peter Cooper Village complex -- Tishman Speyer led a group that put about $1.9 billion of equity into the deal, which had a $6.3 billion value. There was $4.4 billion in debt, about 70% of the deal's total value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compare that with Tishman Speyer's latest deal -- a one million-square-foot Los Angeles office complex, valued at about $435 million, including debt. The purchase of Wilshire Courtyard last month was being made with about $203 million from a Tishman Speyer fund and other equity partners, with a mortgage from <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> making up 54% of the cost, an executive briefed on the deal said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The biggest lesson has been moderating our use of leverage," says the younger Mr. Speyer, co-chief executive. "We did too much financial engineering, and we lost sight of what we were best at."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, lower debt doesn't mean no risk. Tishman Speyer still mostly buys buildings with significant amounts of vacant space or departing tenants, meaning it could take losses if the economy turns. The firm, for instance, is bidding on <span class="companylink">Sony Corp</span>.'s New York office tower, which is slated to be empty in a few years, according to a notice sent out by <span class="companylink">Sony</span>'s real-estate advisers at Eastdil Secured LLC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, some of Tishman Speyer's top-of-the-market investments, other than Stuyvesant Town, remain money-losers. The Illinois State Board of Investment, which invested $30 million with one of the firm's U.S. funds in 2007, listed the value of its investment in June as down by about a third, to about $19 million. Tishman recently advised the fund and other investors it hoped ultimately to break even.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're hoping and praying to get our money back," says William Atwood, executive director of the board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By rebounding, Tishman Speyer has joined a long list of developers that were able to rebuild their empires and prestige after running into problems during down markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think [lenders] say, 'Boy, they sure learned a lesson, and that'll never happen again,'" says Lawrence Longua, a professor at New York University's Schack Institute of Real Estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Government of Singapore Investment Corp</span>., which saw its $575 million junior debt investment in Stuyvesant Town wiped out, has since invested in new Tishman Speyer office developments in China. A spokeswoman for the Singapore fund said it looks for partners that share the fund's commitment to a "long term perspective."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tishman Speyer was formed in 1978 by Jerry Speyer and his father-in-law Robert Tishman, of the prominent Tishman real-estate family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rob Speyer, 43 years old, worked as a reporter before ultimately joining the family business in 1995. In recent years, he has been taking on a more-public presence in New York. He became chairman of the powerful Real Estate Board of New York, an industry group, on Jan. 1. He also is chairman of the Committee to Save New York, a business-backed group with strong ties to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, for whom Mr. Speyer once interned.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Manhattan's lucrative office market, a select number of iconic buildings have long been able to charge rents of over $100 a square foot, like the Seagram Building on Park Avenue and the concave skyscraper overlooking Central Park at 9 W. 57th St.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now the distinction also is beginning to pass to a new generation of upstart developments planned for once off-the-beaten-track neighborhoods. As technology and media companies grow, buildings in places like the Meatpacking District and West Chelsea are considering rents above $100 a square foot, long reserved for traditional trophy towers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a new 50,000-square-foot office development, at 837 Washington St., a venture of <span class="companylink">Taconic Investment Partners</span> and <span class="companylink">Sitt Asset Management</span>, is seeking rents of about $100 a square foot for the office space. Not too far away, the Albanese Organization Inc. is building a 170,000-square-foot office tower at West 22nd Street and looking for rents above $100 a square foot for the penthouse floor, says Christopher Albanese, the company's president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, a partnership plans to break ground this summer on a 10-story office tower that will hover over the High Line on Washington Street. The venture of Property Group Partners and Romanoff Equities are hoping also tenants be willing to pay elevated rents -- above $100 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I would not be surprised if businesses that we would never think of wanting to be in that neighborhood might want to be there -- from stodgy old good American companies to law firms," says Jeffrey Sussman, president of Property Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These developers, of course, might wind up suffering big disappointments. At this point, landlords in these neighborhoods have done few actual deals above the magic $100 number and the history of New York development is full of stories of those who got too far out in front of market trends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But developers say these asking rents aren't just wishful thinking on the part of landlords. Some believe the $100 mark is reachable given rent trends and the major shifts taking place in the Manhattan office market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One change has been the growing importance of the tech sector. Thanks to companies like <span class="companylink">Google Inc</span>., the tech sector has helped offset the contraction of the financial-services industry, New York's traditional engine of growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's led to a shift toward more unconventional areas of Manhattan. It used to be that a tony Midtown address at places like Rockefeller Center or the General Motors Building was essential to top companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But technology and media companies have rewritten those rules. For many of them, it's more important to be in older buildings in hip areas near fashionable bars, restaurants and night life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Midtown South, the average asking rent for top buildings shot up to nearly $71 a square foot in the third quarter of 2012, from less than $63 a square foot the year before, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield. Meanwhile, in Midtown average rents in top buildings merely crept up to just under $74 a square foot, from about $72 a square foot the year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the boom, a number of Midtown office buildings hiked rents well above $100 a square foot, but since the downturn all but a handful have backed off and asking rents for top space have fallen closer to $85 a square foot. Meanwhile, the appeal of the hipper areas has extended from technology, media and fashion companies to hedge funds and small law firms looking to bolster their image.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first building to reach for premium Midtown prices was 450 W. 14th St., a glassy office tower development designed by a star architect, Morris Adjmi, and jammed against the High Line. Tenants started moving into that building early last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Waterman, of Newmark Grubb Knight Frank, the agent for the building, says the asking rents ranged from between $75 and $90 a square foot, and actual rents migrated into the $80s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tenants include fashion companies like Theory and Alice + Olivia, small financial firms and ultra-wealthy individuals renting office space for private-equity firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We were surprised that the building did as well as it did," Mr. Waterman says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just 10 years ago, these kinds of rents would have been inconceivable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In 1997 we went into contract [to buy] 111 Eighth Avenue and they had only gotten at best $16 a foot. I thought for sure $18 a square foot was there," says Paul Pariser, co-chief executive of <span class="companylink">Taconic Investment Partners</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LAUNCHING THE TROPHY CONDO CRAZE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Game Change</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, former Citigroup Chairman Sandy Weill sold his 6,744-square-foot penthouse at Manhattan's 15 Central Park West for $88 million, setting a new milestone for the most expensive apartment ever sold in New York City -- 66% above the previous record sale, set in 2006. The buyer was a trust linked to Ekaterina Rybolovlev, the 23-year-old daughter of Russian fertilizer billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev. The cost breaks down to more than $13,000 per square foot, about 10 times the Manhattan condominium average of $1,300 per square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next Wave</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the wake of Mr. Weill's sale, prices for top-tier Manhattan condos have continued to climb, fueled in part by overseas buyers looking for places to park their cash and Americans looking for trophy properties. In June, casino mogul Steve Wynn paid $70 million for a 10,882-square-foot, 14-room condo at 50 Central Park South, above the <span class="companylink">Ritz-Carlton</span> hotel -- the second-most expensive price paid for a Manhattan apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outlook</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently in contract for more than $90 million each are two duplex condos in One57, a high-rise still under construction across the street from Carnegie Hall. One of the apartments, spanning the 89th and 90th floors, measures 10,923 square feet. The other, known as the Winter Garden, spans the 75th and 76th floors with 13,554 square feet. These sales are expected to close when the building is completed this year; it is expected to be the tallest residential building in the city, at 90 stories. Brokers say momentum at the high end seems to be continuing, especially among foreign buyers, but some say that pricing at the very top end has gotten overeager, particularly as more new ultraluxury buildings come on the scene. Though average asking prices per square foot at 15 Central Park West have continued to rise, sales volume has slowed in recent months.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">$59 MILLION SALE FUELS BUBBLE FEARS IN HONG KONG</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Game Change</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hong Kong's property market vaulted to new heights in 2012, spurred in part by cash pumped into the city from buyers from mainland China, which has recently instituted measures to cool the housing market there. When a 6,683-square-foot apartment on the ninth floor of a Frank Gehry-designed Opus building sold for $58.7 million in October -- a record for the city -- it fanned fears of a property bubble and left observers wondering whether the market would be able to sustain its heady growth. The government took action to curb the frenzy 10 days later when it slapped a 15% tax on any nonlocal buyers; previously there was no tax on nonlocals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next Wave</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the new government tax, agents say demand for superluxury apartments is still strong, and developers haven't yielded on asking prices. Property prices jumped more than 20% over the course of last year, to more than double what they were in late 2008. One 5,500-square-foot, three-bedroom house in the city's tony Mid-Levels neighborhood is asking $77.4 million. Another with a private elevator and garden located on the coast of Deep Water Bay on the island's south side is listed for $80 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outlook</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a space-starved city with limited top-tier luxury options, prices are expected to hold steady for superluxury residences (those over 6,000 square feet), though brokers expect a slight dip in the broader luxury market: Real-estate firm Colliers projects prices to drop about 10%. Meanwhile, the cost of top-tier luxury rentals -- which have gone up some 15% last year compared with 2011 -- are expected to rise still further this year for superluxury properties, though rentals in the broader luxury property market may dip slightly, according to Colliers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JOHN PAULSON BETS BIG ON ASPEN</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Game Change</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, hedge-fund manager John Paulson bought a 90-acre (36-hectare) Aspen, Colo., ranch and an adjoining property from Prince Bandar bin Sultan for a total of $49 million -- one of the priciest home sales in the area, ever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next Wave</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After several down years during the recession, the Aspen home market rebounded in 2011. Prices went up for the first time last year, by about 5%, but are still about 20% down from their peak in 2008, says broker Andrew Ernemann, who publishes reports on the market and is the president of the Aspen Board of Realtors. In 2011, 15 homes sold for more than $10 million; last year, as of late December, 11 homes had sold in that range -- but there were several sales on pricey homes set to close before the end of the year, bringing the tally in line with 2011's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Mr. Paulson's purchase, Aspen has had only one sale over $20 million, but local brokers say the deal has persuaded wealthy buyers across the country to take a closer look at the ski town. "When someone like John Paulson spends that kind of money on a home here, it definitely encourages other people to buy," says Aspen broker Maureen Stapleton of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>. Ms. Stapleton says she currently has an 11,454-square-foot, six-bedroom home in downtown Aspen in contract that she expects to close for around its asking price of $23.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outlook</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Going forward, Mr. Ernemann expects the market to continue to climb back toward its peak, albeit slowly. "It seems that Aspen's stock has been on the rise over the past few years, with the local economy continuing to improve," he says. "I think we'll see seller confidence start to return to the market, although I think all of this will be at a very measured pace. The market will continue the upward trajectory set in 2012, but it's a slow, stable trajectory."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Game Change</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, a 30,000-square-foot, 10-bedroom spec home in Indian Creek Village, Fla., a wealthy private-island community across a bridge from Miami Beach, sold for $47 million, the highest price ever paid for a single-family home in Miami-Dade County. The buyer was a Russian who bought the home in the name of a U.S.-based limited-liability company, according to people familiar with the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next Wave</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2012, the high-end of South Florida's real-estate market soared, with a number of record-breaking sales after years in the doldrums following the housing bust and recession. Spurred largely by wealthy foreign buyers from Eastern Europe and South America, prices for prime real estate at the top end of the market surpassed previous boom-era highs. The previous single-family record was set in March, when another Indian Creek property, a 17,000-square-foot Italian-style home on one hectare, sold for $40 million to hedge-fund manager Edward S. Lampert, who is chairman of <span class="companylink">Sears Holdings</span>. In the wake of the eye-popping Indian Creek sales, other homeowners began raising their prices as well. Leroy Schecter, chairman of Marino/Ware Industries, put his 21,746-square-foot Indian Creek home (located next door to Mr. Lampert's) back on the market for $45 million -- up from $35 million when he first listed it in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outlook</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some brokers have increased asking prices in the area to keep up with blockbuster sales nearby. But others say they are nervous that the pace of ultra high-end sales might be unsustainable in the long term.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LARRY ELLISON BUYS LANAI</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Game Change</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison purchased 98% of the Hawaiian island of Lanai, valued at more than $500 million, for an undisclosed price. The sale included the two Four Seasons resorts on the island, two golf courses and more than 88,000 acres (35,500 hectares) of land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next Wave</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Locals will be closely watching Mr. Ellison's plans -- particularly because his moves will significantly affect the approximately 3,200 residents who live on the land he now owns. Some residents told local media outlets that they were relieved when Mr. Ellison bought the property; its former owner, businessman David Murdock, had taken major losses on Lanai's operations and proposed creating a giant wind farm, an idea that deeply divided the island's residents. Documents related to the sale filed with Hawaii's Public Utilities Commission noted that Mr. Ellison can make "significant investments" in the island that will "directly benefit the people of Lanai." Mr. Ellison has yet to speak with Lanai officials or residents directly, leading some locals to worry about what Mr. Ellison plans to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outlook</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's talk of Mr. Ellison's making some "big natural-energy plays," says Matt Beall, a real-estate broker in Hawaii. Mr. Ellison did not respond to requests for comment. He told CNBC in October that he wants to turn the island into a "little laboratory" for sustainable living.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CHICAGO ON THE RISE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Game Change</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chicago traditionally hasn't been a major luxury market, with few condos priced above $7 million. But the city hit a record sales price for a condo in November when a Park Tower penthouse owned by hedge-fund manager Richard Cooper sold for $15 million to another hedge-fund executive, Citadel founder Kenneth Griffin, according to public records. Mr. Cooper had bought the 7,900-square-foot home on the 66th floor as raw space in 2000 for $3.3 million. Mr. Griffin, who owns the floor beneath the penthouse, plans to combine the units into a two-floor penthouse, according to a source familiar with the sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next Wave</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The condo sale has spurred luxury real-estate agents to rethink pricing in a market with very little high-end inventory. Chezi Rafaeli, who brokered the record sale, has a $32 million listing for a five-bedroom, nine-bathroom penthouse in Chicago's Trump Tower, currently the most expensive condo listed in the city. Mr. Rafaeli says offers have been made, but none that the seller has seriously considered. The 12,000-square-foot triplex of actor Vince Vaughn in the Palmolive building, which previously reigned as the condo-sales record holder when Mr. Vaughn bought the property for $12 million in 2006, is back on the market for $16.8 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outlook</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a shortage of inventory and the demand for high-end property increasing -- particularly from foreign buyers who want to rent out condos at top dollar -- brokers expect prices to rise 20% in the coming year. "The market is going to become extremely tight," Mr. Rafaeli says. "It's going to be very much like the mid-2000s."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Game Change</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November, the 10,000-square-foot home of late Hollywood producer Richard Zanuck sold for $20.1 million -- one of the biggest sales ever in Beverly Park, a gated community in Beverly Hills. The property has a tennis court, a movie theater, a gym, two guest houses and one very unusual feature -- only one bedroom in the main house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next Wave</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though a 10,000-square-foot home with one bedroom is an anomaly, brokers say the Los Angeles market has been robust for luxury one- and two-bedroom homes. There are now six one-bedroom homes listed for more than $1 million in the Los Angeles metro area on Zillow, an online real-estate tracker, including a 1,237-square-foot one-bedroom penthouse in a high-rise on the edge of Beverly Hills that is on the market for $2.175 million. There are five two-bedroom homes currently listed on Zillow for more than $5 million in the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outlook</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey Hyland, president of brokerage firm Hilton &amp; Hyland in Beverly Hills, says business rose to $1.7 billion in 2012 from $1 billion in 2011. "There's a real scarcity of inventory in L.A. right now, with a tremendous number of buyers," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He adds that smaller homes have sold well in part because many of his firm's clients would rather buy a turnkey house than build from scratch. "Who's got three years to spend on building? There are a lot of people who would rather give that time to their own business than to a house."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there are exceptions: Josh Altman of Hilton &amp; Hyland, the broker who represented the buyer in the Zanuck estate deal, says the new owner will tear down the property, building a new home with eight bedrooms.</p>

San Francisco real-estate agent Rick Teed isn't surprised by the low rate; the average rate on a one-year adjustable-rate mortgage was 2.53% for the week ending Dec. 13, according to mortgage-finance company <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next Wave</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wealthy tech executives -- some choosing the city over traditional Silicon Valley enclaves like Palo Alto and Atherton -- helped spur a wave of luxury buying in San Francisco last year, with the IPOs of <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and <span class="companylink">Zynga</span> fueling the spending spree.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently on the market are three parcels in Presidio Heights for $25 million; there's also an eight-bedroom, six-bathroom home listed for $19.5 million near the Presidio. Brokers say rising prices are leading to more private transactions, where the property isn't publicly listed for sale, because keeping it off the multiple-listing service could help the seller get a higher offer.

Another pair of property siblings, the Reuben brothers, have unveiled plans to redevelop the In and Out Club on Piccadilly, a former gentleman's club.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outlook</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These homes will be a litmus test of the passion the global super rich have for supersize homes in prime central London. The price of properties costing more than GBP 10 million (about $16 million) has escalated 50% since 2007, far outstripping the mainstream market. Another boost: After months of speculation, the British government ruled out plans for a so-called "mansion tax", though there will be an annual levy on properties worth GBP 2 million or more purchased by offshore companies. But while the prime market is strong, appetite at the very top end may be slowing: According to Savills, there were 22 sales of homes priced GBP 20 million and above in the first 11 months of last year, compared with 35 such sales during the same period in 2011. The 27,000 square-foot Heath Hall, on the market for more than $160 million, has lingered on the shelf since early 2011.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CHICAGO -- Despite sluggish demand for U.S. office space, a handful of developers are moving forward with plans to build new office towers even before they have lined up tenants -- reviving the risky game of speculative development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of such developments is relatively small, but in the past 12 to 18 months, several big developers have said that they are ready to break ground. One of the latest such moves comes from Hines, the global real-estate investor and developer based in Houston, which has teamed up with Canada's <span class="companylink">Ivanhoe Cambridge</span> to build a 45-story office tower called River Point in Chicago's West Loop. The companies announced their plans in May and say construction will start during the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers in other cities are also moving forward with speculative towers, betting they can lure tenants from older buildings with the appeal of new space, even if overall demand isn't growing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In San Francisco, one of the nation's strongest office markets, <span class="companylink">Kilroy Realty Corp</span>. announced plans to start a speculative 400,000-square-foot building in October. Before it could break ground, it won a commitment from <span class="companylink">Salesforce.com</span> to take the entire tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But finding tenants to fill the space sometimes takes longer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York, at least two speculative office projects are under construction. Edward Minskoff is building 51 Astor Place, a more than 400,000-square-foot building near Manhattan's Union Square with no tenants, while the Related Cos. is moving ahead with a 1.8 million-square-foot tower on the far west side of Manhattan with only a third of the space committed. Related has said it has tentative deals with two other tenants interested in taking space in the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the case of River Point, Hines said the building is a top candidate for several anchor tenants including law firm <span class="companylink">McDermott Will &amp; Emery</span>. McDermott is expected to need at least 250,000 square feet if it moves from its current downtown Chicago location after its lease expires in 2017. The firm said it hasn't yet made a decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a race to see who can get the anchors out there," said Bill Rogers, a broker with <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> in Chicago who represents another large law firm in the market for new space. "There aren't enough tenants for everybody to be able to build their buildings."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">River Point has a head start because the tower has an equity partner and because the initial design by architectural firm Pickard Chilton was completed several years ago. The proposed curved building at 444 West Lake St. offers water views and would be located across the Chicago River from the Wacker Drive corridor popular with many corporate users.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some Chicago real-estate observers noted that the project was expected to start construction before the end of 2012. But Hines said construction is on track and set to begin in the next 30 to 60 days on the base platform that will hold the office tower and that interest from potential tenants has exceeded the company's expectations. "From Hines's plans, we are right on schedule," said C. Kevin Shannahan, senior managing director/chief executive for Hines in the Midwest and Southeast regions of the U.S., in a written statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">River Point is one of several proposed developments in downtown Chicago. Among the others: a nearby mixed-use project called Wolf Point, where a separate venture of Hines plans to start construction of a 510-unit apartment tower before July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">River Point comes as developers have been encouraged by the lack of large blocks of space in the tony West Loop submarket. Downtown prime rents -- those in the best office buildings -- are touching the $37-a-square-foot range, exceeding the low to mid-$30 range hit in the previous peak, according to Studley Inc., a real-estate-services firm that specializes in representing tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The percentage of prime downtown Chicago office space available for lease ticked down to 17.2% in the third quarter from a postcrisis high of 19.4% hit in the first quarter of 2011, though they are still well above the 13.9% 10-year-low touched in 2007, according to Studley. Studley's rates include space occupied but available for sublease.</p>

</div><div class="author">By A.D. Pruitt </div><div>902 words</div><div>2 January 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C7</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bolstered by a strengthening economy and improving housing market, real-estate stocks capped off 2012 with robust returns that outpaced the broader stock market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Equity All REIT Index, which tracks 136 real-estate investment trusts, delivered a total return of nearly 20% for 2012, more than double the 7.5% gains in 2011 and the fourth consecutive year that REITs outperformed the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock index, which gained 16% in 2012. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also lagged behind REITs, posting a total return just over 10%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stocks of home builders posted even stronger gains as revenue climbed on rising home sales. The Dow Jones U.S. Construction Index ended 83% higher in 2012. <span class="companylink">Hovnanian Enterprises Inc</span>., which experienced one of the strongest turnarounds among the big builders, saw its stock climb 383% last year, while <span class="companylink">PulteGroup Inc</span>., the second-biggest builder, rose 188%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although few REIT stocks matched the performance of home builders, the stocks still outperformed many other industries. Investors were drawn to REITs in part because strong economic fundamentals allowed landlords to raise rents, increasing revenue and profit. REITs also have relatively high dividend yields, which currently average about 3%, compared with 1.7% on 10-year Treasurys and an average 2.2% for the S&amp;P 500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs also benefited from perceptions that they are a safer bet than other financial stocks at a time of global and domestic financial unease. "The three major sources of uncertainty were Europe, the presidential elections and the fiscal cliff," said Hessam Nadji, a Marcus &amp; Millichap managing director. "Given the degree of uncertainty elsewhere and real-estate fundamentals improving faster than the broader economy," investors were attracted to real estate, he said. Mr. Nadji anticipates another strong year for REITs, with gains between 10% and 12%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year also was a good year for REITs to raise capital. According to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts</span>, REITs raised a record $67.4 billion in debt and equity as of November, up 30% from 2011. Companies raised $34 billion in equity, $1.5 billion from initial public offerings; $10.3 billion in preferred shares; and $21.6 billion in unsecured debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the funds raised were used to pad war chests for acquisitions and to pay down debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeff Horowitz, global head of real estate, gaming and lodging investment banking at <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, global head of real estate, gaming and lodging investment banking at <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span>, noted that REITs made a significant number of acquisitions in 2012, many ranging in size from $500 million to $1 billion. "We're seeing less transactions of larger scale, but more companies participating and conversations increasing" about new deals, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, mergers and acquisitions activity actually declined in 2012 to $55 billion as of Dec. 5, a 23% decrease from 2011, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>. The number of deals also dropped off, with 1,476 acquisitions recorded in 2012, a 60% drop from the year before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts contend that REITs didn't deploy as much capital as expected because good deals have been hard to find. Valuations for commercial properties have risen sharply in the past year, and U.S. REITs are competing with big foreign investors eager to buy prime properties, especially trophy assets in New York, Washington, Boston and San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The top-performing REIT sectors in 2012 were regional malls, with total returns up 28%, industrial operators, up 23%, and health-care companies, up 20%. A rise in consumer spending emboldened higher-end mall operators to raise rents as retailers posted higher sales and opened new stores. Industrial landlords benefited from rising demand of warehouse space from national retailers, analysts said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The malls that had the best performance were the high-end malls," said Jim Sullivan, managing director of REIT research at Green Street Advisors. He noted this benefited the largest mall REITs, such as <span class="companylink">Simon Property Group Inc</span>., which was up 22%, and <span class="companylink">Taubman Centers Inc</span>., up 27%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Health-care REITs were strong because their average 4.8% dividend yields are among the highest in the sector, and health-care landlords have been most aggressive in acquiring new properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hotel REITs posted smaller gains in 2012, averaging just over 12% in the Dow Jones REIT index. The sector lost didn't have as much luster with investors primarily because revenue rose more slowly than expected. U.S. hotels posted a 6.7% gain in revenue per room in the first 11 months of 2012, a slowdown from their 8.2% gain in the same period of 2011, according to <span class="companylink">Smith Travel Research</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartment companies, among the top performers over the past two years, posted among the smallest returns in 2012, at 7%. Although rising demand has allowed apartment landlords to raise rents, leading to strong profits, some analysts believe conditions will change in 2013 as a wave of new apartment units are set to hit the market. In addition, falling mortgage rates are starting to pull more renters into the home-buying market.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a surge in record-setting trophy sales to billionaires, the Manhattan apartment market had its strongest year since the peak of the real-estate boom in 2008. It left some luxury brokers and firms celebrating what they said was their best year ever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of sales rose sharply, even for lower-priced apartments, and median prices continued a slow rebound, a Wall Street Journal analysis of city property records show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five of the 10 most-expensive residential sales on record in Manhattan closed in 2012, including the three most expensive. There were 11 sales at more than $30 million each, the second-highest year for such sales and more than double the five $30 million deals in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meredyth Smith, a broker at <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span> involved in several blockbuster deals in 2012, said she expects the strong market to continue, despite uncertainty over the future direction of the economy. She said there is still a "great amount of wealth chasing" too few "truly spectacular properties."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These big deals used to be like Halley's comet," she said. "You would only see them now and then. In 2012, it was like a meteor shower."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers say the upper end of the market was driven by American and international buyers who see Manhattan real estate as a haven in uncertain economies, and sellers who were looking to close deals in 2012 because of possible U.S. tax increases in 2013 as "fiscal-cliff" negotiations continue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, apartment sales were the highest since 2008, rising 10.5% in 2012 compared with the year-earlier period, when sales had weakened. A surge in co-op sales outpaced a smaller increase in condo sales in 2012. Sales of apartments that closed for under $1 million also rose, by 9.4% compared with 2011 sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices were up, though more modestly than the percentage increase in sales. The median price of a Manhattan apartment was $840,000 in 2012, up 1.9 % from the year before. The average price was up 4.5%, to $1.44 million, because of the pickup in very expensive trophy sales. Median sales prices of co-ops moved down slightly, while condo prices rose. All the figures are based on sales documents filed by Dec. 27 of each year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, sales activity lagged behind the legendary years of the real-estate boom. The number of sales was off 28.3% from the peak in 2007. The median price was off 7% from 2008, when prices surged, and 14% from the levels hit during the second quarter of 2008, when sales in many newly completed condominiums closed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The year's top-sales list reads like a billionaire's Who's Who. At 15 Central Park West, the new limestone condominium on West 62nd Street, Sanford I. Weill, the former chairman of <span class="companylink">Citigroup Inc</span>., set a record when he sold a 20th-floor penthouse for $88 million to a trust linked to the daughter of Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev. It also set a record price of more than $13,000 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was followed by the $70 million purchase by Steve Wynn, the casino magnate, of an apartment near the top of the <span class="companylink">Ritz-Carlton</span> New York hotel on Central Park South, and the $54 million paid by David Geffen, the music and movie mogul, to Denise Rich, a socialite, for a penthouse on Fifth Avenue, a record price for a co-op.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Howard S. Marks, the investor and founder of <span class="companylink">Oaktree Capital Management</span>, paid $52.5 million for a duplex co-op at 740 Park Ave., while Frank McCourt, the former owner of the <span class="companylink">Los Angeles Dodgers</span>, paid $50 million for a full-floor apartment at 944 Fifth Ave.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many brokers are predicting that the good times in real estate will continue to roll into next year absent an unexpected economic upheaval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frederick Peters, the president of Warburg Realty, said the fiscal-cliff negotiations could cause gyrations in the stock market, which could in turn affect real-estate sales over the short term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with an improved real-estate outlook across the country and a strengthening economy, he said, the New York market would remain attractive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are still a destination for not only flight capital from all over the world and all over the country, but also people who want to be here and not anyplace else," Mr. Peters said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kirk Henckels, director of private brokerage at <span class="companylink">Stribling &amp; Associates</span>, said inventory of apartments on the market has been very tight during 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said a new wave of condominiums will be hitting the market this spring, usually the peak selling season in New York, but it is too soon to tell whether there will be a significant increase in the listings of individual apartments and townhouses as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worries by sellers about the fiscal cliff and rising taxes has also spurred sales this year. Sales in the fourth quarter are up 42% from the year-earlier period, and 26% from the 2010 period, but below the final three months in 2009, when the market was beginning to recover from the downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That could cause a slump in closings early next year. On the other hand, there is a string of very expensive apartments at One57, a new condominium and hotel tower on West 57th Street near Carnegie Hall, due to begin closings in 2013. These contracts include two high-floor apartments in contract for more than $90 million each.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michele Kleier of Kleier Residential said some sellers who planned to close in 2012 but couldn't complete the paperwork in time will be closing in 2013 instead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others who paid high prices at the top of the market in 2007 and 2008 will be closing next quarter because they don't expect to make enough in capital gains to worry about any change in tax rates.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Lumber Futures Log an 8-Year High; Bullish Signs for U.S. Housing, Rising Exports to China Help Drive Increases</span>
</div><div class="author">By Curt Thacker   </div><div>595 words</div><div>30 December 2012</div><div>19:27</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lumber futures jumped to an eight-year high, as signs of a pickup in Chinese buying added to optimism about the U.S. housing recovery that has fueled a three-month boom in the building material.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices of lumber for January delivery on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange reached $392.80 per 1,000 board feet Thursday, their highest trading level since April 2005. Prices have climbed nearly 40% since late September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surge has been driven by several factors including bullish signs for U.S. housing and timely exports to China. The additional export sales—mainly by Canadian mills—occurred at times when the lumber market appeared to be stalling. The extra sales allowed the mills to seek higher prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest price jump, which began in mid-November, sent the January contract up 22% over just five weeks. Home-sales data released in that period showed improving demand. The Commerce Department reported new-home sales for November rose 4.4% from October to the highest level in more than two years. Sales of previously owned homes have grown sharply, too, reaching a three-year high in the latest month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lumber prices also have been supported by a decline in supply in recent years. Some mills were taken out of production after demand and prices dropped in 2008, and by 2011 output had recovered only modestly. Softwood lumber production in North America for 2012 is projected to be about 25% below the level in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, several million acres of pine timber in the U.S. and Canada have been destroyed by infestations of the mountain pine beetle during the past decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China, whose purchases of North American lumber were relatively slow during the first half of 2012, stepped up buying in November and early December as its property market showed signs of revival. The Chinese buying came at a time when lumber dealers were adding to their inventories, said Paul Jannke, an analyst with Forest Economic Advisors LLC, an industry consulting firm in Westford, Mass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As prices took off, lumber users bought additional supplies to ensure they would have enough material in case prices rose even further. Brokers and analysts said an improved outlook for the U.S. housing market also drew increased buying by commodity funds speculating that the need for construction materials would continue to grow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The total number of positions held in lumber futures in late September was about 7,400 contracts, according to the CME, but grew to 11,160 in late November and has hovered between 10,700 and nearly 11,000 in recent weeks. The rise in open interest reflects a surge in positions owned by funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts and traders say the recent gains may be too difficult to sustain. Mr. Jannke had expected prices to peak at $370 per 1,000 board feet for the late fall-early winter period, but futures surpassed that level last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jannke expects a significant amount of selling by mills at or near $400 to lock in those prices if the market gets that high, which would put downward pressure on prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. and Canadian mills produced more lumber in 2012 compared with 2011. They can add to that in 2013, analysts said, which could limit further upward moves in prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The contract for January delivery settled Friday at $378.50, down 2%.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of contracts signed to buy previously owned homes in November rose to the highest level in more than two years on a seasonally adjusted basis, the latest sign of how housing demand has firmed up as mortgage rates tumble to new lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Friday the index of pending home sales, reflecting sales that have gone into contract but haven't yet closed, rose 9.8% last month from one year ago and by 1.7% from October, marking the 19th consecutive month where contract activity has risen from the previous year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand has revived this year despite sharp declines in the number of homes being offered for sale, boosting prices. Low prices initially lured investors who converted homes into rentals, seeking double-digit returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently, traditional buyers -- who plan to live in the home they buy -- have returned in growing numbers. Household formation is expanding as the economy posts modest job growth. Rising rents and prices are sparking a sense of urgency among buyers, who are increasingly frustrated by the lack of attractive inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, mortgage rates have tumbled to their lowest levels in more than 60 years, spurring more activity from traditional owners. <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> said Thursday that mortgage rates this week stood at 3.35% for a 30-year fixed-rate loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Even with market frictions related to the mortgage process, home contract activity continues to improve," said Lawrence Yun, the Realtors' chief economist. "Home sales are recovering now based solely on fundamental demand and favorable affordability conditions."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past five years, the Realtors' index has been higher only in two other months, both during periods in which a home-buyer tax credit stoked a flurry of sales. The index has returned to levels that prevailed in 2002, before the housing bubble began in earnest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Superstorm Sandy upended home-sales activity throughout coastal New Jersey and New York after it struck in late October, Friday's report showed that the storm didn't damp contract activity for the Northeast amid stronger sales elsewhere in the nine-state region. The index hit its highest level of the year in the Northeast, rising 5.2% from October and 15.2% from one year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index also reached or matched previous yearly highs in the Midwest and the South. It gained in the West by 4.2% from October but stood 3.2% below last year's level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many Western housing markets have experienced the most severe inventory shortages and some of the strongest annual price increases.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes in the U.S. rose in November to their highest level in more than two years, the latest in a string of positive reports showing a steady housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New single-family home sales increased by 4.4% last month from October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 377,000, which is the highest level since April 2010, the Commerce Department said Thursday. Sales were up 15.3% from November 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The November results beat expectations. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast an annual sales rate of 375,000, up 1.9% from the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report is consistent with other data in the past week showing continued improvement in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the "lean" inventories figure of new homes for sale "should keep upward pressure on prices and spur new-home construction," said economist Daniel Silver with <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of new homes listed for sale, adjusted for seasonal factors, at the end of November was 149,000, a supply that would take 4.7 months to deplete at the current sales pace. The median price for a new home in November was $246,200, up 3.7% from a month before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, a separate report Thursday showed U.S. consumers, becoming more aware of the impact of the fiscal cliff, turned more downbeat about the future, which weighed on confidence this month. The fiscal cliff is a mix of tax increases and spending cuts set to hit at the start of the year unless Congress acts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conference Board, a private research group, said its index of consumer confidence dropped to 65.1 in December from a revised 71.5 in November, first reported as 73.7. The latest level is the lowest since August and is well below the 70.0 expected by economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires. A similar decline in expectations came in August 2011 during congressional discussions about raising the debt ceiling, the Board said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Undoubtedly, all the negative news surrounding the dysfunction in Washington surrounding the fiscal-cliff negotiations contributed to the December showing," said Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist with MFR Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline was all in expectations. Consumer expectations for economic activity over the next six months plunged to 66.5 from a revised 80.9, which was much lower than the original reading of 85.1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is the lowest since November 2011, when expectations were climbing back from their debt-ceiling funk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The board's present-situation index, a gauge of consumers' assessment of current economic conditions, rose to 62.8 from a revised 57.4, first put at 56.6.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last Friday, Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan reported its consumer-sentiment index for all of December fell sharply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The joint report also pointed to worries about the fiscal cliff and higher taxes as the main reasons for a large reduction in consumers' views about the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a third set of data released Thursday, the number of new unemployment claims fell last week, suggesting a slight improvement to the labor market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial jobless claims fell by 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 350,000 in the week ended Dec. 22, the Labor Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four-week moving average of claims, which smooths out volatile weekly data, decreased by 11,250 to 356,750.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists have warned recently against reading too much into one week of data given the volatility of claims around this time of year. Certain industries have planned layoffs, which can affect the unadjusted numbers.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are on track to notch their first yearly gain since 2006, the strongest performance since the housing bust and a development that could accelerate the real-estate rebound even as the broader economy stutters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market's revival has had several false dawns in recent years, but a recovery that began in the spring has strengthened throughout the summer and fall. The latest confirmation came on Wednesday, when the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller 20-city index showed that prices rose by 4.3% from a year ago in October. Since January, prices are up 6.9% so far this year, the largest year-to-date gain since 2005. A separate index released Wednesday by <span class="companylink">Lender Processing Services Inc</span>. showed that national home prices were up by 5.2% this year through October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The tide has changed," said Ivy Zelman, chief executive of research firm Zelman &amp; Associates. "People feel it's OK to go back into residential real estate -- it's no longer taboo -- and that change in sentiment could have a very powerful effect."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices have risen this year amid stronger demand and sharp declines in the number of homes for sale. Banks slowed down foreclosures after abuses in processing paperwork surfaced two years ago. Since then, banks have become more aggressive at modifying loans or approving short sales, where the home is sold for less than the amount owed. The decline in new foreclosures has reduced the number of homes on the market that sell for large discounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners who normally would sell their properties have been holding them off the market rather than sell at what they perceive to be a lowball prices, leaving inventories of previously owned homes at an 11-year low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weak home construction in past years also is a factor and has left inventories of new homes for sale near the lowest levels in at least 50 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand, meanwhile, has picked up, first as investors scooped up perceived discounts on properties that can be rented out or resold quickly for a profit. Traditional buyers -- those planning to live in the property and not flip it -- also returned to the market, drawn by record-low mortgage rates, rising rents and steady job gains that are increasing household formation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People got tired of living in mom and dad's basement, and rents have gotten much higher than your mortgage payment," said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of Redfin, a real-estate brokerage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, housing markets are still fragile and face stiff headwinds. Mortgage lending standards are still strict, as lenders scrutinize appraisals and borrowers' income history to make bulletproof mortgages. Millions of borrowers owe more than their homes are worth or don't have enough equity to sell their home and make a down payment on a comparable property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median sales prices of previously owned homes stood at $180,600 in November, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>, and have posted year-over-year gains for nine months, the longest such streak since May 2006, when home prices peaked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, sales of existing homes in November were up 14.5% from a year earlier, putting them on pace to reach their highest level since 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upshot is that more buyers have been chasing fewer homes for sale, putting upward pressure on prices. "We've been seeing just crazy competition. Supply and demand has tipped in the seller's favor," said Nani Luculescu, a real-estate agent in Anaheim, Calif. Last month, she represented a buyer who made the winning bid -- among 52 offers -- for a $320,000 four-bedroom home in Garden Grove, Calif., that sold for 10% more than the asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frustrated by a lack of inventory, others are instead purchasing new homes. Sonal Basu, a real-estate agent in San Francisco's East Bay, said in August she noticed that prospective buyers began camping out in tents at the new-home development where she lives in San Ramon, Calif. Some of the "campers," she says, are being paid $250 a day by buyers to wait in line for them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices are rising in part because the share of "distressed" homes -- those selling out of foreclosure or in short sales -- has dropped. While 18 of 20 cities posted year-over-year price gains in October, the largest increases have taken hold in some cities hit hard by the housing bust. In Phoenix, for example, prices have jumped by 21.7% over the past year. Prices gained by 10% in Detroit and 8.5% in Miami.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say many such gains aren't sustainable and instead reflect prices rebounding from very low levels. "They're not going to continue at that pace," said Thomas Lawler, an independent housing economist in Leesburg, Va. He said he expected prices to go up next year, but at a slower pace than this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, some states where banks have struggled to follow court-administered foreclosure processes have large overhangs of mortgages where borrowers haven't made any payments in at least a year. Those homes could eventually hit the market, putting pressure on prices if demand isn't strong. Prices in New York and Chicago, which both have large overhangs, saw prices decline by 1.2% and 1.3% in October from one year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A more immediate concern is how consumer confidence might fare if lawmakers don't reach a solution to avoid the "fiscal cliff," a raft of automatic tax increases and spending cuts set to take place in early 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, low inventories of distressed properties are finally boosting the fortunes of the nation's home builders that have long been sidelined by competition from cheap bank-owned properties.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A developer of trendy boutique hotels has purchased a site on the Lower East Side where he plans to build one of the tallest towers in the neighborhood, according to real-estate executives involved with the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hotelier Ian Schrager and investors including developer Steve Witkoff last week paid about $50 million for a piece of land at 215 Chrystie St. that served for years as a garden for a neighboring building with low-income residents, the executives said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schrager, known for co-founding the 1970s nightclub Studio 54 and developing such hotels as the <span class="companylink">Morgans Hotel</span> and the redone <span class="companylink">Gramercy Park Hotel</span>, bought the site from a group led by landlord Rubin Schron, which also owns the neighboring building, 10 Stanton St.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal shows the value that government actions can sometimes add to a property. It closed only 10 days after Mr. Schron won approval from the city for a plan to put the tower in the place of the garden, a move brokers say vastly increased the market value of the site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planned building would rise to 25 stories -- the first 17 of which would be for a hotel, with the remainder reserved for apartments, according to plans filed with the city's Board of Standards and Appeals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new structure would tower over the low-slung surrounding area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The timeline for the new building just south of Houston Street is unclear, and Mr. Schrager and his partners will likely need to line up additional financing before they can break ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a real-estate executive familiar with the plans said the developer intends to make the hotel part of his new brand called Public, which is designed to be avant-garde but less expensive than many boutique hotels. A prior deal to build an inaugural New York hotel for the brand near Herald Square fell apart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To get approval for the new building, Mr. Schron won the support of the tenants at 10 Stanton St. by agreeing to extend affordability benefits for years -- with rent subsidies provided by the federal government. He also agreed to build a rooftop recreation area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the tenants appeased, the local community board ended up supporting plans for the tower and some preservationists typically skeptical of such towers remained mum, helping clear the way for approval by the city's Board of Standards and Appeals. Property records show a 99% interest in 10 Stanton and 215 Chrystie properties had sold in 2005 for $9.2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the rent at 10 Stanton St. is covered by the federal government, which now pays up to $3,810 a month for a three-bedroom apartment for tenants who cannot afford it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One potential hurdle for the project: the owners of the Sperone Westwater Gallery, which abuts the site of the new hotel. The owners have been critical of the project, which is set to block light in the rear of the Norman Foster-designed gallery that sits on the Bowery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is a clear indication that those individuals or government agencies that could have called the matter into check did nothing," Angela Westwater, a co-owner of the gallery, said when told of the sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gallery is planning to file suit next month, seeking to overturn the decision by the city's Board of Standards and Appeals approving a change for the site without a full environmental review, according to Albert Butzel, an environmental lawyer who helped lead the legal fight to stop the huge Westway highway project in the 1980s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey Mulligan, executive director of the city agency, said the board "stands by its approval and believes it is consistent with case law, prior board decisions and the Board's rules of practice and procedure."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should Mr. Schrager's project go ahead, it would be the largest tower in the neighborhood to rise since 2006 and 2007, the period before the economy turned sour when numerous tall buildings sprouted in the low-rise area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, it would be in another league than many of those buildings. For instance, the New Museum, a stacked, block-like structure a block to the south on the Bowery that rises well above neighboring properties, is 177 feet tall, nearly 100 feet shy of the building proposed for Mr. Schrager's new site.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Josh Mitchell   </div><div>747 words</div><div>28 December 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American consumers are worrying more about the economic outlook, according to a new report suggesting they have begun focusing on possible tax increases and government spending cuts in the new year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> said Thursday its consumer confidence index fell six percentage points in December from a month earlier to 65.1, its lowest level since August. That came just days after another gauge, the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment index, also declined significantly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers surveyed by the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> generally were more upbeat about the current state of the economy than they were in November, but their expectations for the coming six months fell sharply, dragging down the overall index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators and surveys at the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span>, said, "the sudden turnaround in expectations was most likely caused by uncertainty surrounding the oncoming fiscal cliff," the $500 billion in combined tax increases and sweeping spending cuts scheduled to go into effect next week unless lawmakers find a way to avoid them. Ms. Franco noted that consumer confidence fell similarly in August 2011 after a protracted Washington battle over raising the government's borrowing limit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the White House and Congress fail to reach an agreement to avert the fiscal cliff entirely, another recession likely would ensue, economists warn. Even if the two sides forge a deal to avoid most of the cliff, the agreement still could keep in place several measures that will leave many households and businesses with less money to spend and more uncertainty about future budget policies. Both could curb economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prospect of higher taxes already has begun to weigh on some consumers. Rick Garner, of Bossier City, La., said he cut holiday spending this year because he expects his taxes will go up. Mr. Garner, a 50-year-old executive director of a nonprofit organization, said that in the past, he would buy big-ticket items, such as laptops, for relatives, often using credit cards. This year, he said, he bought less-expensive items, such as prepaid credit cards, using only cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Garner said he didn't want to run up any debt with so much uncertainty stemming from the policy fights in Washington. "It seems like it's been going on for a long, long, long time," he said of the political wrangling over government spending and taxes. "And there's a sense of uneasiness that creates instability."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Garner appears to have plenty of company in his concerns. Holiday retail sales notched modest gains, according to preliminary data. This suggests consumers may now be following the lead of businesses, which reined in their spending during recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other reports show the recovery strengthening a bit. The number of Americans filing first-time claims for jobless benefits fell by 12,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 350,000, the Labor Department said Thursday. That is the third-lowest level of the year, though it wasn't clear whether seasonal hiring distorted the numbers. But the overall trend in recent weeks suggests layoffs are easing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, sales of new homes in November rose by 4.4% from October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 377,000, the Commerce Department said. That was the highest level since April 2010, when home-buyer tax credits fueled a burst of activity. Many buyers who closed on new homes in November may have begun shopping earlier in the fall, when worries about the fiscal cliff weren't as pronounced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales are up by around 15% from a year ago. After rising sharply during the spring, sales volumes flattened out during the second half of the year. There were 149,000 new homes for sale in November, leaving a 4.7 month supply at the current sales pace, a seven-year low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say that recent gains in the housing and labor markets are two big reasons why consumer confidence rose during the fall -- in October hitting its highest level in more than four years -- and why their assessment of current conditions improved in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A whole host of economic indicators says the current situation of the economy has been getting better," said economist John Ryding of New York-based RDQ Economics. "That improving data trend and that platform for growth can be completely undermined in the next five days."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos </div><div>1134 words</div><div>28 December 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With their children through college, Myra McWethy and her husband Kevin decided to sell their three-bedroom Santa Monica, Calif., home in May and move to San Diego. Given the soft housing market, they weren't sure how buyers would react to their $1.8 million asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They found out quickly. Within hours of listing, they had an offer for $25,000 above their listing price. They soon had six others. "We got extremely lucky," says the 55-year-old actress, who bought the home 10 years ago for $1.1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a soft 2011, the luxury home market made a comeback in 2012, driven by growing buyer confidence, strong foreign demand, low mortgage rates, more realistic sellers and sharp drops in the number of home listings. Sales of homes priced at $1 million and above rose by 9% in the first nine months of 2012 compared with the same period one year ago to the highest level in four years, according to <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> MDA, a real-estate data firm that tracks public records in the 98 largest U.S. metro areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales are strongest at the $1 million to $2 million level, and sellers can expect more sluggish demand at higher price points. Moreover, many sellers are still finding their homes worth less than the peak values of six years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has likely prompted some to hold their properties off the market. The supply of million-dollar-and-above homes being offered for sale dropped by nearly 8% this year, according to Realtor.com. Also, banks are taking back fewer foreclosed properties. Nearly 2,000 million-dollar homes went through foreclosure this year through October, down by 33% from the same period last year and by more than half from 2010, according to Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has left more buyers chasing fewer homes, giving some sellers the upper hand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a real shortage of inventory throughout our markets in the United States," says Kathy Korte, chief executive of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span> Inc. "We have many more buyers than the high-end homes that we have to sell."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the current sales pace, it would take nearly 12 months to sell the supply of million-dollar properties available for sale in October, down sharply from 21 months one year ago, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. The supply shortage is becoming particularly acute in the West, where the supply of million-dollar homes stood at just six months in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In California, some 18,760 previously owned homes sold for more than $1 million in the first nine months of the year, a 14.8% increase from last year and the highest level since 2007, according to <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>. "Buyers had better come to the table prepared," says Jan Spak, the real-estate agent with Rodeo Realty in Los Angeles who represented the McWethys. She says 2011 was "lethargic," adding, "We didn't have a lot of inventory, but then, we didn't have a lot of buyers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, bidding wars have become commonplace in affluent California markets from Brentwood to Palo Alto, where new land is scarce and where investors have pushed up prices by making all-cash offers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I had so many calls this year from disappointed buyers who thought they had a deal, and the next thing they knew, it was a bidding war and they lost," says Pamela Liebman, chief executive of the luxury brokerage <span class="companylink">Corcoran Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those disappointments are helping to create urgency among buyers. "When you have 25 offers on a property, you now have another 24 buyers who didn't get that home," says Jeff Sposito, president of J. Rockcliff Realtors in San Francisco's East Bay. "They realize very quickly that prices aren't going to get any better."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Spak represented a buyer from Dallas who flew to Los Angeles to sign a purchase contract last month on the same morning that a $3.7 million Brentwood home hit the market. The four-bedroom home, which has a swimming pool and a guest house, drew better offers. But her client acted quickly and got the house, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, many sellers are finding that their homes aren't worth anywhere near what they fetched at their peak, and sales are rising from extremely depressed levels of the past few years. Sales of $1 million properties for the first nine months of the year were nearly half of what they were in at the peak of the housing boom in 2006. Lending standards are still conservative. Banks generally require at least 20% down payments and excellent credit and are thoroughly scrutinizing a borrower's income and the property appraisal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian O'Neil and his wife were shocked when their offer to pay $1.3 million for a five-bedroom home in Glenview, Ill., listed at $1.6 million was accepted. "We thought there was a 1% chance they'd say yes," says Mr. O'Neil, 40.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. O'Neil was ready to buy last year, but he had trouble qualifying for a loan. Because he runs his own small business, a sales-consulting firm, he struggled to meet tougher underwriting criteria that require him to prove his income with two years of tax returns. After renting for 18 months in the suburbs, he found a bank that was willing to make the loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the past few years, strong foreign demand has also helped to push prices higher for trophy properties in Manhattan, beachfront properties in Long Island's Hamptons, and newly built condominium towers in South Florida. Canadians, Asians, Brazilians and Europeans have been lured by a range of factors: fears of a real-estate bubble at home, a favorable exchange rate and the desire for a safe place to park their cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The big difference this year was that the Americans finally got off the fence," says Sally Daley of Daley and Company in Vero Beach, Fla. Europeans and Canadians had accounted for the bulk of her sales in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few luxury markets did as well this year as those benefiting from the technology stock boom in the Silicon Valley. Atherton, Calif., topped the list of the most-expensive markets in the U.S., with an average home value of $3.77 million, up 18% from one year ago, according to Zillow. Values rose by 20% in Los Altos, Calif., to $2.16 million, and by 19% in Marin County's San Anselmo, to $2.17 million.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This pagoda-style home in suburban Chicago was voted the favorite by readers in Mansion's end-of-the-year contest. The home beat other homes profiled this year in the WSJ's House of the Day feature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently owned by Joyce Marcus, the Riverwoods, Ill., home has echoes of Frank Lloyd Wright in its design.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The roughly 5,700-square-foot home features stone aggregate flooring inside and out. Large boulders that line an exterior stone walkway are also found in the living room, where a 30-foot rubber tree was planted during construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home also features a wraparound patio overlooking the landscape. Homeowner Ms. Marcus, who owns a creative marketing and design company, tends wildflowers on the property, as well as daisies, hydrangeas, roses and butterfly bushes, which she says attract hummingbirds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Erickson, a stock trader in Asian markets, purchased this half-acre property within the Hualalai Resort in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii, for $1.9 million in 2005. The following year, he built this Bali-inspired home for about $5.5 million, including furnishings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 5,200-square-foot home has five bedrooms and five full bathrooms. The home was listed in April for $5.65 million. In October, it sold to the owner of a U.S. telecommunications company for roughly $4.7 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property includes an infinity-edge pool overlooking the ocean and an outdoor shower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This roughly 16,000-square-foot home, located in Scottsdale, Ariz., includes an observatory with a retractable roof.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property has eight bedrooms and nine full bathrooms. Former homeowner Bill Gibbs, former president of the University of Phoenix, says he spent $12 million on the property, including the land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A custom-built train with an adult-size conductor's seat, shown here, snakes around the property. The home went to absolute auction in February and sold for $4.62 million to a buyer from Chicago looking for a second home, says Stacy Kirk Reich, president of Grand Estates Auction Company, which oversaw the sale of the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This Connecticut island home has been on the market for $12.9 million since October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After superstorm Sandy, all of the buildings on the island were intact, save for part of the dock, which ended up on the front yard, says homeowner Barrie Zesiger. She estimates having to spend about $50,000 in repairs on what could have been far worse damage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 6,100-square-foot home sports understated interiors and comes with a swimming pool.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Frank Gehry-designed Opus building, set above downtown Hong Kong, is seen here. A 6,683-square-foot apartment on the ninth floor of the building sold for $58.7 million in October—a record for the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, former Citigroup chairman Sandy Weill sold his 6,744-square-foot penthouse at Manhattan's 15 Central Park West for $88 million, setting a new milestone for the most expensive apartment ever sold in New York City—66% above the previous record sale, set in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyer was a trust linked to Ekaterina Rybolovlev, the 23-year-old daughter of Russian fertilizer billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev. The cost breaks down to more than $13,000 per square foot, about 10 times the Manhattan condominium average of $1,300 per square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, a 30,000-square-foot, 10-bedroom spec home in Indian Creek Village, Fla., a wealthy private-island community across a bridge from Miami Beach, sold for $47 million, the highest price ever paid for a single-family home in Miami-Dade County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyer was a Russian who bought the home in the name of a U.S.-based limited-liability company, according to people familiar with the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another photo of the Indian Creek Village home. In 2012 the high-end of South Florida's real estate market soared, with a number of record-breaking sales after years in the doldrums following the housing bust and recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, hedge-fund manager John Paulson bought a 90-acre Aspen, Colo., ranch and an adjoining property from Prince Bandar bin Sultan for a total of $49 million—one of the priciest home sales in the area, ever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chicago traditionally hasn't been a major luxury market, with few condos priced above $7 million. But the city hit a record sales price for a condo in November when a Park Tower penthouse owned by hedge-fund manager Richard Cooper sold for $15 million to another hedge-fund executive, Citadel founder Kenneth Griffin, according to public records. Mr. Cooper had bought the 7,900-square-foot home on the 66th floor as raw space in 2000 for $3.3 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The condo sale has spurred luxury real-estate agents to rethink pricing in a market with very little high-end inventory. Chezi Rafaeli, who brokered the record sale, has a $32 million listing for a five-bedroom, nine-bathroom penthouse in Chicago's Trump Tower, currently the most expensive condo listed in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rafaeli says offers have been made, but none that the seller has seriously considered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November, the 10,000-square-foot home of late Hollywood producer Richard Zanuck sold for $20.1 million—one of the biggest sales ever in Beverly Park, a gated community in Beverly Hills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property has a tennis court, a movie theater, a gym, two guest houses and one very unusual feature—only one bedroom in the main house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christian and Nick Candy, the 30-something property developer brothers behind One Hyde Park, London's priciest apartment complex, snapped up a 10,000-square-foot home in Chelsea in September for about $121 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, a seven-bedroom, 7½-bath Italianate mansion on Broadway in San Francisco—often called Billionaire's Row—sold for $28.3 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale was the third-most-expensive single-family listing in the city's history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison purchased 98% of the Hawaiian island of Lanai, valued at more than $500 million, for an undisclosed price. The sale included the two Four Seasons resorts on the island, two golf courses and more than 88,000 acres of land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Locals will be closely watching Mr. Ellison's plans—particularly because his moves will significantly impact the approximately 3,200 residents who live on the land he now owns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg reportedly refinanced the $6 million mortgage on his Palo Alto home last spring, getting a 30-year adjustable-rate mortgage starting at 1.05%.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Conor Dougherty   </div><div>758 words</div><div>23 December 2012</div><div>19:26</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite rising home prices and more home construction, one crucial piece of the real-estate equation—construction jobs—continues to lag behind. But that could change soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the biggest surprises of 2012 has been the second-half improvement in the housing market. Real-estate company <span class="companylink">Zillow Inc</span>. predicts that the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller 20-City Composite Home Price Index, to be released Wednesday, will show a 4.1% year-over-year increase in prices. The nation's latest jobs report, for December, will be released the following week, on Jan. 4.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government's most recent employment report continued the drumbeat of bad news about construction, with the industry shedding 20,000 jobs in November. While that total likely was influenced by disruptions from superstorm Sandy, it was just the latest setback for construction workers who have been struggling for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The construction sector shed about 2.2 million workers during the housing bust and recession. From the housing market's bottom in January 2011 through last month, it added just 58,000 jobs. The U.S. economy added 3.4 million jobs over that period, and unlike the erratic construction market, it has added jobs every single month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The meager progress in construction jobs illustrates how the real-estate and home-building sector—which in past recoveries has been a driver of business activity and consumer spending—has bedeviled the current recovery. In fact, real estate was a drag on growth for most of the recovery, though it is now adding to growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as the housing market starts to help lift the economy, construction looks poised to become a job creator in coming months. Economists and construction companies point to a number of indicators to support their optimism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits for single-family homes, a barometer of future construction activity, jumped to an annual rate of 566,000 in October from 452,000 in January, according to <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics. And construction workers already on the job are putting in longer hours. The average workweek for production and nonsupervisory construction workers was 39.4 hours in November and October, the highest level since December 2006. The data hint that companies will need to hire soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You're only going to work your existing workforce so hard. You need to hire people at some point," said Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction companies' reluctance to add workers can be chalked up to caution. After years of fits and starts, home builders want to be sure the housing recovery persists before expanding their payrolls. That caution has been heightened by economic uncertainties wrought by the billions of dollars in federal tax increases and spending cuts known as the "fiscal cliff."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, while home building has picked up, it remains way below peak levels. That means many home-building companies—and the trade subcontractors, such as roofers and drywall installers, who build most of their properties—have been able to meet rising demand with the workers they already have, said John Burns, chief executive of John Burns Real Estate Consulting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, builders have spent the past few years competing with an overhang of existing homes, notes Bill Davidson, founder of <span class="companylink">Davidson Communities</span>, a Del Mar, Calif., home builder. That has driven them to lower prices by offering stripped down home designs that are simpler and cost less to build. "We're taking construction elements out of the house to make it more flexible and efficient," Mr. Davidson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alta Drywall is among the companies that are hiring slowly. Doug Bellamy, president of the Escondido, Calif., company, says revenue is about half what it was in 2007, while the company's 80-employee payroll roster is down from 200 in better times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, he sees reasons for confidence. "The indications are that the market is starting to turn around and that will drive our hiring up—provided it's sustained," Mr. Bellamy said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company's workload has climbed as builders start more houses. In some cases, Mr. Bellamy said builders who were constructing four homes at a time a few months ago are now building eight at a time. In addition, he said, so many workers have left the construction business that a shortage of skilled workers has prompted his company to increase wages to roughly $17.50 an hour from about $16 an hour eight months ago.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks Sweat It Out</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite an canceled House vote on a tax bill intended to avert the "fiscal cliff" of steep tax raises and spending cuts, stocks were able to eke out a gain for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4% to 13190, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 rose 1.2% to 1430.15.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales Up, but Starts Fall</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes in the U.S. rose 5.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.0 million in November from a month earlier, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said. Housing starts fell 3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 861,000, down from a revised 888,000 rate in October, according to the Commerce Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Tax Cut Expires</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most U.S. workers are facing tax increases next year regardless of the fiscal cliff. The payroll tax cut, which has lowered wage earners' share of Social Security taxes by two percentage points for the past two years, is about to expire. For a household earning $50,000 a year, that translates into an average tax increase of about $1,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Fund Record</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Customers have invested a net $130.4 billion in Vanguard Group's mutual funds and exchange-traded funds this year through November, setting a new industry record. It was previously held by <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span>, which had net inflows of $129.6 billion in 2008. Vanguard has beaten its former record of $104 billion in net inflows in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rigging the Rate</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Swiss bank <span class="companylink">UBS</span> said it would pay $1.5 billion to settle charges that it led a conspiracy to rig the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, which affects trillions of dollars in loans and other financial products. Its actions may have resulted in more than $3 billion worth of losses at mortgage giants <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rallying Again</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are happy times here again? Some 40% of investors believe the global economy will strengthen in 2013, according to the BofA Merrill Lynch Fund Manager Survey for December, an increase of six percentage points from the previous month. The fiscal cliff is still the No. 1 worry for investors.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes rose in November to the highest level in three years. At the same time, a sharp decline in the number of properties on the market is beginning to give some power to home sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.04 million units in November, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Thursday. That marks a 5.9% gain from the previous month and a 14.5% increase from one year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was only the third time since July 2007 that home sales have crossed the 5 million mark. Sales surpassed that threshold briefly in late 2009, when the looming expiration of first-time home-buyer tax credits fueled a buying frenzy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes for sale fell from one year ago to 2.03 million, which is the lowest level since the end of 2001. At the current pace of sales, it would take just 4.8 months to sell that supply, a seven-year low. The Realtors' group considers a balanced market to have a six-month supply of homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condominium sales, which were hit hard during the housing slump amid heavy overbuilding, were up by 33% from one year ago, driven by higher sales in the South, particularly in Washington, Atlanta and Florida. Condos, which have accounted for around 10% of all home sales this year, are "beginning to catch up" with other gains in the single-family market, said Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patrick Newport, an economist at IHS Global Insight, said, "Because of low and falling inventories and low interest rates, the housing market will continue to improve and outperform the rest of the economy over the next few quarters."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories have been falling over the past three years as more homeowners keep their properties off the market rather than accept prices that are lower than what they paid. Nearly 11 million homeowners owe more than what their residences are worth, and millions more don't have enough equity to sell their home and make a down payment on another property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many investors have been making all-cash offers to buy distressed properties that can be renovated and rented out. For-sale inventories are low "because household growth has significantly outpaced new construction activity, and you have so many investors buying properties," said Thomas Lawler, an independent housing economist in Leesburg, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising demand and falling supply have helped to put a floor under prices. Prices in October rose by 0.5% from September and by 5.6% from one year ago, according to a separate report Thursday by the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span>. That was the largest year-over-year gain since 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, prices are rising because the share of distressed sales -- those selling out of foreclosure in a short sale, where a lender allows a home to sell for less than the amount owed -- have dropped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Distressed sales accounted for 22% of sales in November, down from 29% one year ago, according to a survey by the Realtors' group.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Matthew Strozier </div><div>1130 words</div><div>21 December 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans are on the hunt for new homes -- on the Internet, at least.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Google</span>'s real-estate search volume was up 65% year-over-year in November, perhaps another sign of life in housing market. What are house hunters looking for? <span class="companylink">Google</span> analyzed searches for eight house types for The Wall Street Journal, ranking the top states where people were searching property terms such as "Colonial," "Ranch" or "Craftsman."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results, which tracked searches from November 2011 to November 2012, showed that many people keep to traditional regional preferences: the Craftsman is popular in the Northwest; Tudors have appeal in New York. But a few surprises emerged: Connecticut beat out states like Colorado in searches for ski houses, and "penthouse" got more searches in Florida than New York. Here's a breakdown of what feels most like home in different parts of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colonial</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most searched in: Virginia</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the market: Virginia has 25,348 Colonial homes on the market; median price, $344,450</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Colonial" encapsulates a broad array of styles, from clapboard or shingle siding in New England to brick in the South, but it usually means a home with a fairly steeply pitched roof and a symmetrical design, says Richard Guy Wilson, professor of architectural history at the University of Virginia's School of Architecture. The term initially described 18th-century American houses and later evolved into a style known as Colonial Revival, heavily used in new construction from the 1950s to the 1970s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days in Virginia, "Colonial" often means one thing for buyers -- a three-level home, says Nicholas Pasquini Jr., a broker and chief financial officer for Century 21 <span class="companylink">Redwood Realty</span>. Buying a Colonial helps with resale values, he adds, since "the bulk of the market is looking for a Colonial-style home." And brokers feel comfortable adding "Colonial" to for-sale listings since they know it will appeal to a wide swath of the market, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Craftsman</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most searched in: Washington</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the market: There are 330 Craftsman homes on the market in Washington state, according to Realtor.com; the median price is $325,000, according to <span class="companylink">Trulia</span></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A craftsman typically has broad roof overhangs, large gables, an asymmetrical design, a porch and an exterior of wood, brick or stone, says John DeForest, principal of Seattle-based DeForest Architects. "They are kind of beloved but they do have some weaknesses," says Mr. DeForest, who has handled lots of remodels of Craftsman homes. Kitchens can seem closed off, without easy access to the backyard and other living space, and their modest size makes them frequent candidates for expansion. But their efficient layout and quality materials give them enduring appeal, particularly in the Northwest, says Mr. DeForest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cottage</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most searched in: Oregon</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the market: 668 cottages in Oregon; median price, $202,500</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers looking for a modest Craftsman sometimes start with a search for "cottage," architects and brokers say, which helps explain the popularity of the search term in the Northwest. Cottage homes are often raised off the ground a few feet, have a neat look and feature a porch on the side. But for house hunters, the term often describes a lifestyle more than a specific architectural style: It's often used in searches for a second home. Among the house types analyzed, "cottage" listings in Oregon had the lowest median for square feet, at 1,270, according to <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tudor</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most searched in: New York</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the market: 1,307 Tudors in New York; median price, $525,000</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tudor homes are generally recognized by their steeply pitched roofs, brick veneer with stucco, wood detailing, leaded windows and arched entry. Tudor-Revival homes, popularized in the early 20th century and evoking English manors, suggested success to earlier generations, says Mark Demerly, an architect and owner of Indianapolis-based Demerly Architects. (Indiana was second on the list of states for "Tudor home" searches.) "People wanted a home that looked established." But the plaster can be a maintenance headache in certain climates like Indianapolis, Mr. Demerly says, and the style has faded for new construction. Requests for Tudor style "hardly ever come up for new homes," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ski House</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most searched in: Connecticut</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the market: Median price for a ski house in nearby Vermont, $335,000</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though Connecticut is not known as a ski state, there are lots of ski spots nearby, including in Vermont, where brokers say many of their clients come from Connecticut. Walter Findeisen, owner of ERA Mountain Real Estate in Killington, Vt., said contemporary-style ski homes are popular these days: "If they own a Colonial down in Connecticut, they won't come up here and buy a Colonial home."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Penthouse</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most searched in: Florida</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the market: 433 penthouses in Florida; median price, $622,500</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Florida might seem like an unlikely place to search for penthouses, but the rise in high-rise living helps explain all those searches. "Now there are penthouses all over Florida, whereas 40 years ago there wouldn't have been any," says Andrew Dolkart, professor of historic preservation at Columbia University's Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation. Although traditionally the top floor, the "penthouse" level sometimes extends down a floor or two these days, brokers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ranch</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most searched in: Iowa</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the market: 5,563 ranch homes in Iowa, including working ranches; median price, $169,975</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evoking the real or imagined American ranch, these homes typically have a single story, or story and a half. The popular form of the ranch dates to the early 1900s in Southern California and drawn from the earlier Spanish or Mexican haciendas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It took hold after World War II and became emblematic of suburban living. "The ranch has always been the most in demand," says broker Diane Poore, of EllisPoore Real Estate Group in Creston, Iowa. Buyers, sometimes retiring farmers, like the ease of living on a single floor with an open floor plan, even if the long roofs might mean higher maintenance costs, she adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Farmhouse</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most searched in: North Carolina</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the market: 330 in North Carolina; median price, $225,000</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether on a working farm or not, these homes tend to have a wood exterior, two stories and a traditional layout with formal rooms downstairs and bedrooms upstairs. People can be particular about farm houses, says Elizabeth Anderson, a broker with Coldwell Banker Howard Perry &amp; Walston in North Carolina. They want them renovated, but not too renovated, with a good amount of acreage but shopping and services relatively close.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Pui-Wing Tam </div><div>1378 words</div><div>21 December 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott and Pamela Weiss paid a little under $5 million for a home in Palo Alto, Calif., last year. Come tax time, they expect to get back about $66,000 for tearing it down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's because the Weisses, who are spending more than $4 million to build a new home on the site, took down the original home using a method known as "deconstruction." In this process, a crew carefully dismantles an older property by hand instead of using bulldozers. The process costs more than a straightforward demolition -- the Weisses paid more than $20,000 for the disassembly, roughly double what they would have paid for a wrecking crew. But they were able to donate home materials such as lumber, roof tiles and even lamps to nonprofits for reuse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The donated materials were appraised by an appraisal-and-consulting firm at $159,000, which the Weisses can apply to their tax bill to receive a deduction. Based on the Weisses' tax bracket, Ms. Weiss estimates that will ultimately work out to a savings of around $66,000, or more than three times the cost of the deconstruction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're not the kind of people who just come in with a bulldozer and clear a house out," says Ms. Weiss, whose husband is a Silicon Valley venture capitalist. And since deconstruction ended up paying for itself, it was "not a hard decision" to pursue it. The Weisses are now building a five-bedroom, 7 1/2-bathroom, 6,000-square-foot modern Mediterranean home that they expect to be completed late next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deconstruction is a growing trend, as more homeowners try to avoid the wrecking ball when they remodel or tear down and instead find a way to reuse everything from doors to windows to light switches. Spurring the movement is growing awareness of "green" building, as well as more laws restricting the dumping of building materials into landfills. It doesn't hurt that there's typically a big fat tax break attached, either.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the tax break has been around for decades, deconstruction had mostly occurred in fits and starts in pockets across the country, including a wave in the 1990s. This current surge is centered in wealthy enclaves along the West Coast, in areas such as Silicon Valley and cities including San Diego, Los Angeles, Portland, Ore., and Seattle. Many of those locales share a distinctive set of features: populations with eco-friendly mind-sets; an older housing stock ripe for tear downs; strict environmental laws and moneyed residents eager for a substantial tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Simpson, an architect based in Redwood City, Calif., who often works with Silicon Valley technology executives on multimillion-dollar homes, says about 50% of the projects he does now involve a deconstruction, up from only 10% in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Five or six years ago, it was a novel thing," he says. Now it has reached "more of a critical mass," with the value of tax deductions from the process routinely starting at $40,000 to $50,000 and going north of $100,000, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ReUse People of America, a nonprofit building-materials salvage and reuse organization with 13 offices nationwide, says it has done 250 deconstructions this year, up 25% from 2008. The largest slice of the deconstructions -- about a fifth -- took place in California, says ReUse People's president, Ted Reiff. Outside the West Coast, cities such as Chicago and Durham, N.C., also had a sprinkling of deconstructions, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During deconstructions, people donate a wide range of goods. While the chief material that comes out of the process is lumber, Mr. Reiff says clients also toss in appliances, toilets, lighting fixtures -- even cactuses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some people who do deconstructions have never lived in the home they bought, so sometimes brand-new doors, windows and kitchen cabinets also get recycled, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In one house, there was $100,000 of just lighting fixtures," Mr. Reiff recalls of one deconstruction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roderick Cooper, a deconstruction specialist in Palo Alto, says he recycles nails, carpet, copper wire, toilets, tubs, faucets, switch boxes and more. The only materials that defy deconstruction are generally a home's insulation, which can't be reused, and stucco, which ends up in the landfill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a home is disassembled, the building materials typically go to nonprofit building centers, which aggregate the goods and then sell them to nonprofits and directly to the public. At least several West Coast metropolitan areas, including the San Francisco Bay area and Portland, have such centers, like the ReUse People in Oakland, Calif. and the Rebuilding Center in Portland. Owners or their contractors bring the materials to the centers, which confirm receipt. Ms. Weiss says that she followed the trail of what happened to the roof barrel tiles from her home and found that they eventually were procured by the Habitat for Humanity East Bay/Silicon Valley in Oakland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Habitat for Humanity East Bay/Silicon Valley says it aims to use deconstructed materials in the homes it builds, and that it also resells used building materials, which nets the organization $250,000 a year. Bryan Kilgore, a procurement coordinator at the nonprofit, says he later sold the Weisses' roof barrel tiles to a contractor in Concord, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deconstructions may not initially appear to offer much of a financial or time advantage over demolition. In 2010, Adrienne Leigh and her husband bought a nearly $900,000 home to tear down in Burlingame, Calif., as part of their decision to downsize as their sons grew older. When Ms. Leigh priced out a straightforward "smash and haul" demolition, she got bids for around $12,000 for what would be a one-week job. A deconstruction, she discovered, would cost $25,000 and take at least two weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ms. Leigh decided to do a deconstruction after further calculation -- and she was rewarded when the materials from the deconstruction translated to a $34,000 tax benefit. "It was more men and took two weeks instead of one," says the 56 year old. "But I still came out ahead by $10,000." Ms. Leigh and her husband last month moved into their newly rebuilt 2,770-square-foot Normandy-style home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some cities are now aiming to incentivize homeowners to try deconstruction. In Palo Alto, homeowners don't need to wait for a building permit to be approved before they can proceed with a deconstruction, whereas they must obtain a permit before moving ahead with a regular demolition. The city's ordinances now also require that 90% of "inert debris" such as asphalt and concrete from a construction project, plus 80% of the remaining construction and demolition debris such as metal and wood, be diverted away from landfills, says Scott McKay, an associate planner in the Palo Alto Department of Planning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of that has pushed Palo Alto developer James Witt, who has been building homes for more than three decades, to try the process last year. He has now done two home deconstructions, including one of a two-bedroom bungalow this past week. Mr. Witt says he looked into doing deconstructions in the past, but they were generally five to six times the cost of a regular demolition. Now prices for deconstruction are becoming more competitive with demolitions, so "I'm pretty sure we'll do it going forward," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Robert and Monica Fortunato in Hermosa Beach, Calif., deconstruction was one piece of a larger project to renovate their 1959 contemporary home to become a net-zero-energy and zero-carbon house, meaning the home would ideally harvest as much energy as it used on an annualized basis. Through a deconstruction last year that cost $11,000, the couple saved French doors, toilets and lumber and netted a $38,000 tax deduction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We wanted to save as much as we could," says Mr. Fortunato, a 49-year-old strategy consultant.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks Sweat It Out</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite an canceled House vote on a tax bill intended to avert the "fiscal cliff" of steep tax raises and spending cuts, stocks were able to eke out a gain for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4% to 13190, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 rose 1.2% to 1430.15.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales Up, but Starts Fall</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes in the U.S. rose 5.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.0 million in November from a month earlier, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said. Housing starts fell 3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 861,000, down from a revised 888,000 rate in October, according to the Commerce Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Tax Cut Expires</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most U.S. workers are facing tax increases next year regardless of the fiscal cliff. The payroll tax cut, which has lowered wage earners' share of Social Security taxes by two percentage points for the past two years, is about to expire. For a household earning $50,000 a year, that translates into an average tax increase of about $1,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rigging the Rate</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Swiss bank <span class="companylink">UBS</span> said it would pay $1.5 billion to settle charges that it led a conspiracy to rig the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, which affects trillions of dollars in loans and other financial products. Its actions may have resulted in more than $3 billion worth of losses at mortgage giants <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Fund Record</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Customers have invested a net $130.4 billion in Vanguard Group's mutual funds and exchange-traded funds this year through November, setting a new industry record. It was previously held by <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span>, which had net inflows of $129.6 billion in 2008. Vanguard has beaten its former record of $104 billion in net inflows in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rallying Again</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are happy times here again? Some 40% of investors believe the global economy will strengthen in 2013, according to the BofA Merrill Lynch Fund Manager Survey for December, an increase of six percentage points from the previous month. The fiscal cliff is still the No. 1 worry for investors.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home construction slipped in November. Housing starts fell 3% from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 861,000. Construction climbed for three consecutive months, helping the housing market inch back toward health. Housing starts are still up 21.6% from a year earlier. Permits, a sign of future activity, also rose in November.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Peter Evans  </div><div>866 words</div><div>19 December 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Europe Edition)</div><div>WSJE</div><div>24</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.K. home builders are continuing to struggle with weak demand even as their counterparts in the U.S. enjoy a housing recovery that is enabling them to ramp up production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction was started on 98,020 new homes in the U.K. in the year ended Sept. 30, a 9% decline from the previous year and down from a peak of 183,000 in 2006, according to U.K. government figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That contrasts with the U.S. housing market, where consumer confidence is at its highest level in six years, and builders are putting up homes at the fastest pace in more than four years. They are encouraged by rising home-sale prices and increased demand stemming from the lowest mortgage rates in decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the difference is that the U.S. economy is stronger. In November, the U.S. added 146,000 jobs, according to the Labor Department, while the rate of unemployment dropped to 7.7%, its lowest level since December 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, the U.K. employment outlook also is brightening. The country added 40,000 jobs in the quarter that ended in October, according to the latest available figures from the <span class="companylink">Office for National Statistics</span>. The unemployment rate fell to 7.8% from 8% in the previous quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the euro-zone crisis weighs heavier on the U.K. than on the U.S. Also, the U.K. has just emerged from a double-dip recession and faces a fresh round of austerity measures in the new year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, prices are moving in different directions in U.S. and U.K. housing market. In the U.K., house prices are projected to fall between 5% and 10% in the next two years, according to Fitch Ratings, adding another disincentive for home builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, prices have begun to rise in many markets in the U.S., as demand has returned and supply has tightened. So far in 2012, the rise in prices has been the fastest since 2005, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller national price index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price increases play a big role in market psychology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In view of the tightening supply and other improving conditions, many potential buyers who were on the fence are now motivated to move forward with a purchase in order to take advantage of today's favorable prices and interest rates," said Barry Rutenberg, chairman of the U.S. National Association of Home Builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are some positive forces at work in the U.K. home-building market. Many home builders have cash on their balance sheets, and land is cheap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, the rate of home buying has been much slower than normal, indicating there likely is pent-up demand. More people in their twenties and thirties still live with their parents than at any time in the past two decades, according to the <span class="companylink">Office for National Statistics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But fears over job security and falling real wages mean many potential first-time homeowners are unwilling or unable to save for a mortgage deposit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Credit also remains tight in the U.K. Mortgage approvals have hovered around 40,000 to 50,000 a month for several years, compared with more than 100,000 a month before the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"House builders have done what they can, but there's a limit to what private businesses can do to shape the market," said Steve Turner, a spokesman for the Home Builders Federation, an industry association. "Ultimately, we need to see the banks lending more so people who can afford to service a mortgage can buy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders in many areas also continue to face an arduous planning and government approval process. That may further restrict supply even if demand increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of the weak market, some home builders are reluctant to buy land in anticipation of new development, a process known as land-banking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The fact that house prices are slightly down means we're not looking to grow our land bank," said David Thomas, finance director at U.K. home builder <span class="companylink">Barratt Developments PLC</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Land-bank reductions indicate home builders are less prepared for a surge in demand if the U.K. market starts to recover, but any uptick is some way off, Mr. Thomas added. "Improvement is going to take time," he said. "The banks have got to be looking at a stable environment before they start lending again."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The differences between the U.K and U.S. markets are cultural, as well as structural, analysts say. In Britain, household debt remains high and bankruptcy is only a last resort, whereas in the U.S., many households have defaulted on repayments and started again with no debt, often in a different state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In the U.S., the private sector has deleveraged by mortgage default," said Anil Jhangiani, director of corporates at Fitch Ratings Ltd., which carried out a recent study on U.K. home builders. "The U.K. should follow the U.S. housing recovery given time, but both remain fragile and face significant headwinds."</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Demand for Architects Builds Momentum --- Billings for Design Jobs Rise for Fourth Consecutive Month on Improving Housing Market and Institutional Demand</span>
</div><div class="author">By Robbie Whelan </div><div>820 words</div><div>19 December 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are few professionals more hopeful for a bright future this holiday season than architects, who are finally starting to see business conditions improve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Billings at architecture firms have been depressed for the past four years, another victim of the real-estate and housing downturn. But in recent months, that has started to change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Architecture Billings Index, which is scheduled for release Wednesday, rose to 53.2 in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is the fourth consecutive monthly gain, up two points from a year ago and the highest reading since November 2007, according to the <span class="companylink">American Institute for Architects</span>, which compiles the index. A reading above 50 indicates that billings are increasing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rise in architecture billings can have broad economic repercussions. The pickup means firms will need to hire new design teams, helping to reverse the slide in working architects, whose numbers declined to 153,000 in 2011 from 214,000 in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising billings also are viewed as a gauge of future construction activity because real-estate developers tend to break ground on new projects nine to 12 months after they hire design firms. Construction generates large numbers of jobs for engineers, contractors and tradesmen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kermit Baker, the AIA's chief economist, said much of the rise in billings reflects improvements in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Construction Economics 101 would say . . . when you build homes, you need stores, you need schools, you need health-care facilities, so it triggers this broader, supportive activity around it," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October, home builders started new-home construction at an annual rate of 894,000 units, the highest level in four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Architects also are seeing a significant rise in business from the public-sector and from nonprofit organizations, including medical centers and colleges. Architecture firms getting the most business these days cater to institutions rather than to private companies developing speculative office buildings, which in the past has been considered some of the priciest and more-prestigious work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many speculative projects that entered the planning stage during the boom years, like Fifth + Columbia, a proposed 43-story office tower in downtown Seattle, remain stuck on the drawing boards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bob Frasca, a partner in Portland's <span class="companylink">Zimmer Gunsul Frasca Architects LLP</span>, which designed the project, says he hasn't heard from its developer in three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Legat Architects, a 48-year-old Chicago firm, specializes in building transit projects and college and university facilities. The firm is currently working on a commission for Joliet Junior College, which involved about $150 million in classroom buildings, a campus center and research space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think higher education has probably been the most-active market in the last year or two," said Alan Bombick, a principal with Legat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bombick says inquiries and billings are up this year, and the firm is currently building a hotel that is part of large mixed-use development being coordinated by the <span class="companylink">University of Chicago</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Firms that do business with architects report that conditions are improving, as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, <span class="companylink">A. Zahner Co</span>., a Kansas City-based metal fabricator and engineering firm whose clients include top architecture firms such as <span class="companylink">Zaha Hadid Architects</span> and Herzog &amp; de Meuron, was laying off employees and cutting work shifts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this year, the firm is going into 2013 with a $15 million backlog of work. That is smaller than the $20 million to $25 million backlog that is typical in a good year but is a big improvement over last year, said Gary Davis, Zahner's head of marketing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He predicts that billings will rise 10% between 2012 and 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's an optimistic view toward design again, and it's not just the big firms," Mr. Davis said. "People are calling about design questions again, rather than just calling to ask, 'Do you have a cheaper way of doing this?'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neil Denari, a 55-year-old Los Angeles architect, gained international prominence after designing his first free-standing building, HL23, a 14-story condominium building along the High Line, an elevated park in Manhattan that was widely celebrated by the design community. Still, Mr. Denari had to lay off 12 of the 15 employees between 2007 and 2010, as billings fell 75%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, with commissions on the rise, Mr. Denari has staffed back up to 10 employees and has four new commissions, including an office building in Los Angeles and a mixed-use harbor-front project in Taipei, Taiwan. He says he has entered a competition to design a research institute in Cleveland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're going to be putting more energy into pursuing educational projects, because that's where a lot of the work is," Mr. Denari added.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kris Hudson </div><div>854 words</div><div>19 December 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sprawling Roosevelt Field mall on Long Island, anchored by Bloomingdale's, Nordstrom and <span class="companylink">Macy's</span>, ranks among the 20 most-lucrative malls in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Roosevelt Field's owner, <span class="companylink">Simon Property Group Inc</span>., still intends to spend roughly $300 million in the next two years to improve the shopping center. The overhaul will add a <span class="companylink">Neiman Marcus Group</span> luxury department store, expand the mall's dining choices and upgrade its movie theater with lounge seating and full menus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After decades of retail construction, the era of new-mall development in the U.S. is drawing to a close. Much of the country is overbuilt, and online shopping has crimped many retailers' store-opening plans. In an attempt to keep shoppers coming -- and to squeeze more revenue out of established locations -- mall owners and retailers are shifting to renovations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are very few markets that aren't already served by sophisticated retail," said Rick Sokolov, president of Simon, the country's largest mall owner. "Making what you already have as good as it can be is the best way to go."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If overhauls are done right, their returns can be higher than from new developments. Landlords and analysts say the improvements can generate annual income of as much as 10% to 12% of the cost of the upgrades. By comparison, new development typically yields returns in the high single-digit range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, <span class="companylink">Taubman Centers Inc</span>.'s 2007 redevelopment of its Twelve Oaks Mall in Novi, Mich., which added a wing anchored by Nordstrom, yielded a 10% return on the project's $63 million cost, according to Taubman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As they renovate, mall owners are incorporating the lessons they are learning about how to succeed amid the explosion of online shopping. For all the hand-wringing among store owners about sales lost to the Internet, many are figuring out ways to exploit the natural advantages that stores have over computers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mall owners are adding more restaurants, upscale movie theaters, supermarkets and other tenants that offer goods and experiences that can't be found online. In their renovations, some malls also are reconfiguring more stores to have direct access to parking lots, so shoppers can dash in and out for quick service rather than having to traverse the entire shopping center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">General Growth Properties Inc</span>., the second-largest mall owner, has earmarked $1.5 billion for redevelopment projects, including 17 that it started this year and another eight to begin in 2013. In one of its largest projects, the company is planning to raze a <span class="companylink">Sears Holdings Corp</span>. store at its flagship Ala Moana Center mall in Honolulu and replace it with small shops that collectively would pay more in rent than single department stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, <span class="companylink">CBL &amp; Associates Properties Inc</span>., which owns 93 U.S. malls, had redevelopment projects in various phases at 20 of its properties this year. <span class="companylink">Westfield Group</span>, owner of 47 U.S. malls, intends to ramp up its redevelopment efforts, spending $3 billion over the next three years, compared with the $800 million it spent in the past three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mall owners are being selective about centers to upgrade. The retail-property industry has a long history of throwing good money after bad by trying to save shopping centers facing tough competition and growing vacancy rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, most redevelopment is taking place at the country's top-performing malls, like Roosevelt Field, which is packed with holiday shoppers scrambling to complete their gift lists. Only 289 of the country's 1,070 malls are considered to be in this category because they generate median annual sales of $535 a square foot, compared with the industry average of $370.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Green Street Advisors, a real-estate research firm, estimates that Roosevelt Field, in Garden City, N.Y., generates average sales of $1,040 a square foot, thanks largely to the demographics of the market it serves. More than 1.8 million people live within 10 miles, and the median annual household income is $116,302 in that area, more than double the average in the U.S. of $50,502, according to Simon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Returns also have proven to be more attractive for landlords that have invested in strong properties rather than weak ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Simon, for example, is redeveloping 25% of its top malls in terms of sales per square foot, 10% of its mid-class malls and none of its lowest-performing malls, according to Green Street. "That's where you get the biggest bang for your buck -- when you take good and make it great," said Cedrik Lachance, a Green Street analyst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Simon, owner of 159 U.S. malls, the redevelopment push has the company planning to spend more than $1 billion in each of the next three years revamping its best properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The more compelling we make our properties, the better they will be able to compete with all other forms of retail distribution," Mr. Sokolov said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sarah Portlock                And Andrew Ackerman   </div><div>425 words</div><div>19 December 2012</div><div>08:39</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—U.S. home building contracted in November after surging the previous two months, but permits rose to the highest level in more than four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts decreased 3.0% last month from October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 861,000, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. Since November 2011, new home construction was up 21.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Growth in housing starts was extremely strong in the prior three months, so some giveback is not a concern at this point," said analyst Robert Kavcic with BMO Capital Markets, especially because of a rise in permits last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report showed that the number of new building permits, an indication of future construction, rose by 3.6% to an annualized level of 899,000 in November to its highest level since July 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This upside momentum in building intentions...suggests that the slowdown in new construction activity could be short-lived, and we expect starts to rise back to around the 875,000-plus range in short order," said Millan Mulraine with <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of single-family homes in November, which made up two-thirds of housing starts last month, dropped 4.1% to a rate of 565,000 units. Single-family construction was up 22.8% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starts in October were revised down to a rate of 888,000, but that was still the highest level since July 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past year, housing has become a driver of the recovery. Spending on home construction and home improvements has contributed to economic growth for six consecutive quarters, the Commerce Department said last month. A report Tuesday showed U.S. home builders' confidence rose for the eighth straight month to its highest point since April 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While this year's housing starts are up from a low of 478,000 in April 2009, they are still below the historical average. Builders have started construction on about 1.5 million new homes a year since 1959.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce data showed new home building slowed in two of four U.S. regions last month. It was down by 19.2% in the West and 5.2% in the Northeast, but rose by 3.3% in the Midwest and 2.9% in the South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actual housing starts, which are calculated without seasonal adjustments, were 64,600 in November. Lumber and commodities markets watch those numbers closely to gauge demand.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kaya Laterman </div><div>801 words</div><div>18 December 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A22</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After years of discussion, a $330 million plan by <span class="companylink">Princeton University</span> to build a large arts complex and shift the Dinky commuter-train line to a new station on campus is slated for a pivotal vote by local officials Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Regional Planning Board of Princeton, a joint board of Princeton borough and township whose approval is needed for area land-use measures, is scheduled to take action on the university proposal. A delay in acting on the proposal could cause complications because the board is slated to dissolve at year-end as part of a plan for the borough and township to merge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The university has been at work on the development plan since 2006, dealing with zoning issues, easement transfers and numerous meetings with elected officials of both the Borough of Princeton and Princeton Township. Opponents have waged a vigorous fight against the plan, including bringing court suits in an effort to block the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The university is in full compliance with zoning and there are no remaining outside issues to deal with. It's time to act and we are ready to move on," said Robert Durkee, a vice president and secretary of the university.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dubbed the Arts and Transit Neighborhood, the development plan has been high priority for the university's trustees and President Shirley Tilghman, who is stepping down in June after what will be a 12-year tenure. It calls for building music and dance rehearsal studios and outdoor performance areas, as well as new roads, parking and communal public spaces on the west side of campus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To make room for the planned development, the university plans to move the campus terminal of the Dinky, the NJ Transit commuter line running less than three miles between Princeton and NJ Transit's Princeton Junction station. The Dinky carries about 1,000 weekday riders who connect with NJ Transit and Amtrak Northeast Corridor trains at Princeton Junction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dinky's two current station buildings, both on university property, would be turned into a cafe and restaurant and the university would build a new terminal 460 feet to the south. A Wawa convenience store, a kiss-and-ride drop-off area and bicycle storage paid for by the university also are planned. The school would pay for all track removal and maintenance of the new station, said NJ Transit spokeswoman Nancy Snyder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opponents argue that the added walk from the current station would deter ridership and that added roadways would be more dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists trying to get to the Dinky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The location of the new train station is hidden from roads and it's designated to kill the train service," said Bruce Afran, a lawyer and an adjunct law professor at Rutgers University. He represents several members of an opposition group called "Save the Dinky" that has filed three court suits seeking to stop the plan for a new station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its proposal to the planning board, the university said it needs to relocate the Dinky terminal in order to build an access way into an existing parking garage for use by visitors to the new arts facilities slated to open in 2017. The restaurant and cafe envisioned for the current station buildings also would serve visitors coming to the planned art complex, said Mr. Durkee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But opponents don't see the need. "The university's reason to build a ramp into a parking garage isn't a viable reason to move the station," said Alain Kornhauser, a professor of operations research and financial engineering at Princeton. Mr. Kornhauser, also the director of the university's transportation studies program, says he would like to see alternative solutions to the university's plan, including moving the station north to Nassau Street, Princeton's nearby retail corridor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The regional planning board is currently the only regional body in New Jersey that votes on land-use applications to see if they comply with state and local laws. Because of the pending borough-township merger, the board is slated to disband by year-end and appointments for a new board, which can include current members, are scheduled to be made next month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the university plan, which has the support of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, NJ Transit and the Princeton Regional Chamber of Commerce, isn't approved by the planning board on Tuesday, a vote on the measure will wait until the new board is up and running. Calls and emails to the planning board seeking comment weren't returned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dinky was threatened with extinction in 2010 with a proposal to replace it with bus service. The idea was ultimately dropped.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Amy Hoak </div><div>1106 words</div><div>17 December 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>R4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Encouraging signs in the housing market may entice more homeowners to put their properties on the market in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, it isn't exactly a seller's market yet -- and deals can fall through at the last minute for a variety of reasons. Financing delays, low appraisals, title problems, home inspections and even buyer's remorse can interfere with a seller's ability to close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news: Many of these problems are preventable if sellers are proactive and involved, says Lanny Baker, president and chief executive of ZipRealty Inc., a residential real-estate brokerage. Here are some tips:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. Learn about the buyer's financing</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seek out a buyer who has been preapproved for a mortgage, says Mr. Baker, who evaluated 250 failed or delayed deals over a recent 2 1/2-month span and determined that financing problems were to blame 40% of the time. Typically, the buyer's agent will be eager to share this information with you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, preapproval doesn't preclude a lender from rejecting a buyer's mortgage application later on, so don't stop there. Check in regularly with the buyer's agent to ensure that the loan is on track to close on time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders are requiring more stringent documentation, and if buyers aren't organized, or procrastinate when additional paperwork is requested, the closing could be delayed. To keep things on track, make sure your contract contains specific deadlines for buyers. "One key term is a financing contingency, and if the buyer cannot [resolve] that contingency, the terms of the contract would normally release the seller to entertain other offers," Mr. Baker says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a buyer is seeking a <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span>-insured loan, the home being sold may have to meet certain safety and soundness requirements that typically wouldn't come into play with a conventional loan. To avoid delays, sellers can take care of things that might be flagged in an FHA appraisal, such as chipping paint, before listing. An experienced real-estate agent should be able to help identify such problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes buyers underestimate the amount of cash they will need at closing. If that happens, the agents involved in the transaction -- who have a vested interest in the deal closing -- may agree to give up part of their commissions to cover the shortfall, Mr. Baker says. A seller can pay some of those costs, as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. Consider cash offers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A buyer who doesn't need financing is more of a sure bet than one who does, says Bob Kelly, an agent with Re/Max Main St. Realty in Moorestown, N.J. However, cash bids are typically lower, so sellers need to weigh their options carefully.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A buyer with a 3.5% down payment who is also asking for seller-assisted closing costs may bring in a larger return for the seller, but the deal could take longer to complete or be derailed by a low appraisal, Mr. Kelly says. A cash buyer won't need an appraisal, just verifiable funds, and may offer an earlier closing date -- which in the seller's eyes could compensate for the lower offer.'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. Prepare for the appraisal</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agents will tell you that low appraisals have killed many transactions in recent years. Many agents say appraisers -- who are hired by lenders to assess the value of the home -- are overly conservative in their valuations these days, even as home prices are rising in many locations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To avoid appraisal problems, price your home in line with comparable homes for sale in your area. Even then, however, problems may emerge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John and Susan Moon priced their Bethesda, Md., home competitively and received multiple bids. Still, the appraised value was $5,000 lower than the offer they accepted. In the end, they split the difference, dropping the price by $2,500 while the buyers brought $2,500 more to the closing table, Mr. Moon says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In some cases, you're pioneering new values," especially when receiving multiple bids that raise your home's price, says Stew Larsen, head of mortgage banking at <span class="companylink">Bank of the West</span>. "As a seller, you need to think about what is Plan B if [the appraisal is low."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sellers can challenge a low appraisal, he says, but they rarely win unless the appraiser made an obvious mistake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One option is to add a contingency to the contract, laying out how the sides will renegotiate if the home's appraised value is lower than the sale price, says Paul Reid, an agent with Redfin in Orange County, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4. Tackle title and inspection issues early on</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some listing agents include a preliminary title report as part of their package, but a good agent will be able to spot red flags when reading it for you, Mr. Baker says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps a sewage assessment wasn't paid by the homeowner, the deed never got recorded, or an easement was granted that the owner is unaware of, he says. Addressing such issues early on will mean fewer surprises at the end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, instead of waiting for the buyer's home inspection to turn up problems, sellers should get one themselves before listing, says Tony Geraci, broker/owner of Century 21 HomeStar in the Cleveland market. That way, they can make needed repairs before the buyer requests them -- or gets scared off, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5. Commit to a tight timeline</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a seller, time isn't your friend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Encourage buyers to move quickly on things like the home inspection. If a deal is going to collapse, it is better to know sooner rather than later so the home can go back on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A longer process also gives a buyer more time to get cold feet. After winning a bidding war, buyers sometimes look at closing documents and paperwork and realize they're spending more than they should have on the home, triggering buyer's remorse, Mr. Reid says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if the buyer is looking for reasons to get out of a deal, it may be better to oblige than waste more time. "You never want to keep a buyer that doesn't want to buy your house. Let them out and find the next buyer," Mr. Geraci says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Colin Bodell moved into a new 3,000-square-foot condo in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood in August, he was looking forward to living with its 30-foot ceilings, polished-marble floors and 20-foot-tall stained-glass windows. One thing he didn't anticipate, however, was people knocking on his front door to ask what time services were or to speak to the pastor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People still thought it was a church because of its exterior," says Mr. Bodell, a 50-year-old technology executive at Amazon. "They didn't realize it had been transformed into a home."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bodell's apartment, which he bought for about $1 million, sits inside a former Christian Science Church that was converted into 12 townhouses earlier this year and renamed the Sanctuary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building is one of a number of church-to-home luxury conversions popping up around the country. As dozens of churches close or move to different quarters each year, they're finding second lives as condo developments and townhouses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conversion process is growing more common as shrinking congregations and shifting demographics have made it difficult for some congregations to stay afloat financially. According to a March report from CoStar Group, a real-estate research firm, 138 church-owned properties across the country were sold by banks last year, compared with 24 three years earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Roman Catholic Church, for example, has closed hundreds of churches in recent years. In 2000, there were 19,236 Roman Catholic parishes across the U.S.; that figure fell to 17,644 by 2012, according to the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate, a nonprofit research organization that compiles church statistics. United Methodists have seen the number of churches shrink by about 7% over the past decade or so, with 300 to 400 churches closing or merging each year. In 2000, United Methodists had 35,537 churches, compared with 33,069 in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Seattle church where Mr. Bodell now lives was built around 1908 as First Church of Christ, Scientist, and counted about 800 regular attendees in its heyday. But by 2006, its congregation had dwindled to about 25 people, so the congregation relocated and sold off the church property for $1.3 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Architects have found creative ways to convert these historic buildings -- which often have 40- or 50-foot-high ceilings, few or no interior walls and stained-glass windows -- into homes and apartments that will sell for millions of dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it isn't an easy process: Not only do the structures need intensive interior reconstruction and upgrades to meet modern building codes, but they often have been granted landmark status, further complicating renovations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The good news with churches is that you have 40-foot-tall ceilings, but the bad news is that you have 40-foot ceilings," says <span class="companylink">Continuum Co</span>. chief executive and developer Ian Bruce Eichner, who in the early 1980s renovated an 1846 Greek Revival-style church in Manhattan's Greenwich Village to create 15 co-op units. "And because churches are usually landmarks, you can't change the facade," he adds. Most big urban renovations cost about $10 million and can take two to four years, or in the case of the Seattle project, about $12 million over a five-year period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Boston area, more than a dozen churches have been converted to residential projects over the past decade or so. That's in part because there has been a steady supply. The Archdiocese of Boston closed 76 parishes in the metro area under a 2004 consolidation plan, selling 38 of those for just over $73 million. (To signify that a church is no longer a church, the archbishop signs a decree that relegates the building to "profane use.")</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the churches closed was a Tudor-style church called St. Aidan's in Brookline, Mass., where John F. Kennedy and Robert Kennedy were both baptized. It reopened in 2009 as a residential project. The church's stone facade and slate roof were preserved, but the interior walls were reframed to support two additional floors. The church was converted into nine high-end condo units that each sold for between $1 million and $1.8 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the units in St. Aidan's have two-story windows, granite countertops and double-height living rooms with overlooking balconies. Some units also have exposed wooden trusses from the church as well as the church's original dentil molding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those rarefied architectural details are a major attraction for many occupants of church-to-home conversions. Shankar Sundaram, 34, a research engineer for <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>, recently moved into a 2,900-square-foot, two-bedroom townhouse in the former Christian Science church in Seattle with his fiancee. "We figured that a place would hold its value more if it was unique, like a piece of art," he says. "And it's pretty hard to replicate a 100-year-old church."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sundaram and his fiancee love to entertain in their four-story townhouse, which has 35-foot-high ceilings. The dining table sits underneath two 20-foot-tall stained-glass windows. "It's the perfect space to play music," he says of the space. "Whatever you play sounds like it's live, like you're in a concert hall as opposed to listening through a stereo."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the guest bedroom, there's a skylight that looks onto the church's main stained-glass dome. The couple installed an electric blind over the skylight so they can surprise guests with it when they visit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People who live in church conversions say that they easily find uses for some of the more unusual artifacts. Automotive executive Bob Jensen and his wife bought a converted 1920s Presbyterian church in 2007. It's now a 3,463-square-foot home 20 minutes outside Denver. They say that their four granddaughters like to come over and ring the steeple bell, pulling a rope hanging in the home's foyer. "We have a tradition of ringing it on New Year's," Mr. Jensen adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jensen and his wife eat breakfast every morning in a nook where the altar used to sit. The couple sleeps in the choir loft, which overlooks the space. "When you're in bed, you're in the center of the church, which is a great feeling," says Mr. Jensen. There are exposed wooden beams remaining from the original structure throughout the home, and one wooden pew from the church sits in the living room, along with more plush couches. Despite its novelty, the pew is often the last seat chosen by guests, Mr. Jensen notes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers of church projects say they are sometimes hesitant to convert sacred structures into commercial enterprises. Brian Badrigian, who developed a late-19th-century Baptist church in Watertown, Mass., into eight condo units, says he had "mixed feelings" about buying the property in 2003 for $1.4 million, especially because it was located in the same town where his family had lived since emigrating from Armenia in the early 1900s. "While the sale allowed the congregation to move to a more suitable location, it was also a move away from a special place," he says. "But I have very good feelings about saving a historic building."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Badrigian spent about $9 million on renovating the property, which includes eight units in the church, two units in the former rectory and four townhouse units he built on the church's former parking lot. Of the eight units in the church, five have sold for between $700,000 and $1.5 million. The four townhouse units sold for around $1 million each, and the two units in the former rectory sold for about $700,000 each. Mr. Badrigian says he tried to build units with modern amenities, such as dishwashers, cellulose insulation in the walls and laundry rooms with washers and dryers, while also retaining some of the unique architectural elements of the church, such as its wooden trusses and paneled ceilings. Some of the units on the second floor have living and dining areas with 36-foot-high ceilings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our unit isn't churchy at all, but it definitely feels unique and different and not boring," says Mary Shia, a fundraiser who moved into a three-bedroom condo there. Ms. Shia says that she has, however, experienced some backlash in the community over living in a former church. "The cable guy had a hissy fit about having to install cable in a church," she says. "He acted like the world was ending because people were now living inside churches."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although it's still relatively rare in the U.S., the adaptive reuse of churches has become a popular practice in other countries, like the U.K. In 2006, the <span class="companylink">Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors</span> found that since 2001, about 500 churches in London alone had been converted into homes. In other countries, such as Germany and Russia, people still regard the concept of living in a church as disrespectful, says Bart Kellerhuis of Utrecht-based firm Zecc Architects, which has done several church-to-home conversions in the Netherlands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of challenges in such conversions is reducing the vast space of a church into something more livable. Living spaces can feel overwhelmingly grand, and heating costs can be considerable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrew Sudds, who with his wife, Kristin Conley, paid $600,000 for a former Lutheran church in Chicago's Humboldt Park neighborhood last year, says it is virtually impossible to keep the room where he they sleep warm. The roof isn't insulated, making it hard to heat the 3,500-square-foot space with a 39-foot ceiling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We don't keep the heat running, otherwise we'd owe thousands of dollars in heating bills," says Mr. Sudds, an information-technology specialist for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois. "But even if we did, the heat would just rise and escape through the roof. The fact is that this structure wasn't built for continuous habitation."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sanctuary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Seattle</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's the real-estate version of the Reformation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To transform a Christian Science Church in Seattle into townhouse residences, construction crews had to fabricate a new interior framework while preserving the exterior "skin" of the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Runberg, the architect on the project, designed a concrete floor and a steel frame to support the new interior structure. The project's design team also built floors to divide the 45-foot-tall space into three stories, creating 12 distinct units. To give residents more light, about a dozen additional window and door openings were cut in the church's exterior -- made from Bedford limestone, the same material used on the Pentagon and the Empire State Building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They also reused some of the historical details and furnishings. Pews -- built with 100-year-old vertical-grain fir -- were cut up and used to make stairs in some units. Some of the stained-glass windows were installed onto sliding tracks, with clear glass panels behind them. Those let natural light permeate the structure and allow residents to open and close their windows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, the design and construction team repaired and preserved the stained-glass oculus in the church's ceiling. The area below that dome became the lobby, where residents can mingle. Last month, Colin Bodell, an Amazon executive, threw a 1920s-speakeasy-themed party for 80 people there, complete with a jazz band.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction on the project began in 2007, and the first resident moved in earlier this year. Total cost for the makeover: about $12 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Every historic building has a unique story to tell," says Mr. Runberg. "In this case, we tried to build upon the redeeming and historic aspects of the church, while innovating and adding contemporary details that modern-day residents would want."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With demand for farmland showing no signs of slowing, the market is welcoming the return of a missing element: supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of land used to grow crops are surging, with owners capitalizing on a sustained rise in real-estate values driven by low interest rates and historically high prices for corn and soybeans. But the last straw for many prospective sellers has been Washington's continued fiscal confusion and the prospect of higher taxes next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was the deciding factor for Judy Beetzel and her four siblings, who last month sold the family's 770-acre farm in central Illinois to a local farming family for $10,900 an acre, more than double the state average three years ago. The family had been renting the land to two local farmers, and Ms. Beetzel said they were going to continue that practice after her father's death in August. But plans changed after the family accountant estimated selling now could save as much as $500,000 in taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My father "loved that land. But we know he would want us to do the best we could," said Ms. Beetzel, 61 years old.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The family joined a rush of sellers looking to capitalize on a marked rise in land prices that goes back several years, prompting debate over whether a bubble could be forming in the Farm Belt. But the sales don't represent farmers cashing out. In fact, just the opposite: Experts say most sellers aren't farming the land themselves, while most buyers are farmers looking to capitalize on long-term industry trends as well as scoop up land that may become available once in a generation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comprehensive data on farmland transactions aren't available, but more than half of real-estate professionals in a survey last month sponsored by <span class="companylink">Iowa State University</span> reported a rise in farmland sales from a year ago, the highest number since it started asking the question in 1986.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, <span class="companylink">Farmers National Co</span>., the largest auction firm in the Midwest, did a record 76 farmland auctions in October, seeing in recent months a 20% jump in the number of farms sold from a year ago, said Chief Executive Jim Farrell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's just amazing the amount of farm sales that are going on right now," Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gov. Branstad, like other observers, attributes the recent flurry of transactions to nervousness about the "fiscal cliff," a combination of spending cuts and increases in federal taxes that could start to take affect Jan. 1. Starting next month, the federal tax rate on capital gains is set to climb to 20% from 15%, while a new 3.8% tax on capital gains that is part of the health-care overhaul law also takes effect. Additionally a key exemption for land passed from one generation to another will drop to $1 million from more than $5 million under current law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But sellers would likely not be as anxious to pull the trigger if prices hadn't enjoyed such a steady march higher. Across a large section of the Great Plains, the value of farmland has risen 70% since the fourth quarter of 2009, according to data from the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ryan Downs said the likely increase in capital-gains taxes played into his decision to sell 150 acres outside of Omaha, Neb. last month. But he also questioned how much more prices could climb, with the value on his land jumping 130% over six years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I find it hard to believe it returning 20% every year," said Mr. Downs, chief executive of an Internet company in Omaha, who added that he doesn't foresee a collapse in prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, despite the new supply of properties for sale, there is little evidence of falling prices. The survey by Iowa State found the average value for an acre of cropland in Iowa jumped 24% from a year ago, to $8,296 an acre.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many bankers and regulators anticipate price stability in part because many purchases continue to be made by farmers buying with cash to expand their operations -- rather than by speculators with borrowed money. Even after this year's severe drought, many farmers have cash on hand from crop-insurance payments and record prices paid for the corn and soybeans they were able to harvest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is a lot of cash in the market, and it's in farmers' hands," said Shawn Smeins, managing director at a subsidiary of <span class="companylink">Rabobank</span>, which is based in the Netherlands and an active agricultural lender in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and other large lenders say they remain conservative, but bank regulators say they are watching. A memo from the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> last fall warned that cropland values "may reflect overly optimistic long-term expectations."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders have put in a number of controls "to prevent what we would call an overheated lending market," said Robert Coleman, chief examiner for the Farm Credit Administration, which regulates institutions accounting for more than a third of all lending in the rural U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brent Gloy, associate professor at <span class="companylink">Purdue University</span>, warned that the market for cropland could be vulnerable in the event of either higher interest rates or lower farm incomes. In the near term, however, the biggest red flag would come if lenders come under growing pressure to make more loans. "The biggest concern to me is if we start to see a lot more credit in these transactions," he said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Ian Sherr </div><div>845 words</div><div>13 December 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A13B</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First the personal-computer industry, then the smartphone and then the tablet. The latest area touched by <span class="companylink">Apple Inc</span>.'s innovation: its hometown of Cupertino.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As <span class="companylink">Apple</span> moves closer to breaking ground on its new campus, Cupertino is experiencing a flurry of economic activity, with commercial rental rates surging and construction projects ramping up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It brings a sense of confidence to see that <span class="companylink">Apple</span> is making this significant investment here," says Todd Trekell, a regional senior vice president at commercial real-estate-services firm Borelli Investment Co. He says many property owners are touting their relative proximity to <span class="companylink">Apple</span> as a selling point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cupertino's office rental rates have jumped about 40% in the past year, according to commercial real-estate firm <span class="companylink">Colliers International</span>. The average asking rate for office rentals was $3.75 per square foot in the third quarter, compared with $2.69 during the same time a year ago. In Santa Clara County as a whole, rents rose about 9% during the same period to $2.79 per square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"<span class="companylink">Apple</span>, as one of the most successful headquarters tenants, is helping economic growth in the area," says Katherine Roxborough, a vice president at Colliers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Apple</span>'s new offices, known as Campus 2, will be built on 175 acres about a mile east of the company's current headquarters at 1 Infinite Loop off Highway 280. <span class="companylink">Apple</span> co-founder Steve Jobs unveiled the plans to the city of Cupertino, which has a population of some 60,000, in June of last year. Some people have likened the striking circular design of the building to a spaceship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction is expected to begin next year on the 2.8 million-square-foot structure -- which will accommodate up to 12,000 employees and include a 1,000-seat auditorium, a fitness center, a research facility and underground parking -- following a delay of about six months while the company continues to modify its proposal for the project. The campus is expected to be completed in 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cupertino officials say they have observed an uptick in building efforts around the city following <span class="companylink">Apple</span>'s announcement of its plans last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Certainly, we've seen that the amount of activity for projects has increased," says Rick Kitson, public-affairs director for the city. While he says it is unclear if <span class="companylink">Apple</span>'s plans for the new campus are directly related to the upswell, he adds that the timing was notable. "There's long-term vacancies and long-term projects that are now coming to fruition."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, <span class="companylink">Apple</span> operates out of about 50 buildings in Cupertino, aside from its current headquarters. The company is the largest landowner in Cupertino, with an estimated $808 million in assessed property values, according to an annual report compiled by the city for fiscal 2011. It is unclear what <span class="companylink">Apple</span> will do with its current buildings once Campus 2 is finished, but a person familiar with the matter bills the new property as part of the company's ongoing expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Apple</span> is also the top employer in Cupertino, according to the city's report. <span class="companylink">Hewlett-Packard Co</span>. is the second-largest jobs provider in the city. <span class="companylink">Oracle Corp</span>. is another big employer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One beneficiary of <span class="companylink">Apple</span>'s plans is <span class="companylink">Kimco Realty Corp</span>., a real-estate investment trust that owns a 115,000-square-foot shopping mall, Cupertino Village, across the street from the new campus. Kimco says that after the new campus was unveiled it began getting phone calls from hotel companies that saw an opportunity to house the tech and media executives who would likely parade through, as well as high-end retailers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conor Flynn, head of Kimco's western operations, says the increased interest has led the company to expand its multi-million-dollar renovation plans for the mall by as much as 25%. He adds that the shopping center, which contains a <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span>, several Asian restaurants and others, is weighing a ground lease to a hotel operator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Flynn says Kimco has also begun considering new amenities, such as free wireless Internet hot spots and touch-interactive sign boards, to cater to the tech-heavy crowd. The firm also plans to approach <span class="companylink">Apple</span> about beginning a regular shuttle service to ferry employees from the campus to the shopping center and back, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Now that <span class="companylink">Apple</span> has landed its flag here, it will become an international destination," Mr. Flynn says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others are less sure of how <span class="companylink">Apple</span>'s campus will affect their operations. Mark Teagle, who heads up outreach for the Good Samaritan United Methodist Church, which is a block away from the new campus, says for now the church isn't planning to add staff in response.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's still a few years down the road in terms of when it will be finished," he says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JACKSON, N.J. -- The <span class="companylink">Federal Emergency Management Agency</span> housing units stand side by side in an amusement park lot here, ready to be moved into sometime next week by people who lost their homes to Sandy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With at least 400 square feet of space, the so-called trailers are brand new and bigger than many New York City apartments. Local officials and displaced residents have been clamoring for them for weeks, as New Jersey grapples with a severe housing shortage for storm victims.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, New York City officials who are also wrestling with an enormous housing problem haven't requested trailers and don't intend to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We don't need FEMA trailers," Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Tuesday. "We're focusing on getting people back into their homes. That's what we want to do."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trailers represent an example of the divergent paths New York City and New Jersey are taking to house tens of thousands of people displaced by the ferocious Oct. 29 storm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing units became a lasting symbol of the misery wrought by Hurricane Katrina, resulting in a $43 million class-action court settlement for 55,000 Gulf Coast resident after elevated levels of formaldehyde were found in the trailers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bloomberg said potential toxicity was one concern of his. Other officials said the units don't make sense for the city on other levels. Most importantly, the city doesn't have room for trailers to be staged en masse and hooked to utilities, according to FEMA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other parts of New York state have found the trailers useful. Some were staged in upstate communities badly hit by Tropical Storm Irene in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the city, the focus has been on helping victims find rentals, repair their damaged homes quickly without the typical red tape or grant them vouchers to stay in hotels. New York officials also have requested a monthlong extension of hotel vouchers now going to 2,200 Sandy victims. The program is set to end on Dec. 15.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We all came to an agreement that this was the way we wanted to go, that this was the best solution for the urban population," said Denise Everhart, a FEMA spokeswoman for New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FEMA officials defended the current crop of trailers, saying they are different than the temporary travel units used after Katrina.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only units suitable for full-time living are now deployed, and the U.S. Department Housing and Urban Development certifies that they meet adequate living standards and are safe, FEMA officials said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some displaced New Yorkers said they were open to living in trailers, including Arnold Simancas, a 43-year-old Sheepshead Bay resident who has stayed in a hotel since Sandy ruined his apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If it was here, yes," said Mr. Simancas, who is considering sleeping in his car if the hotel vouchers aren't extended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New Jersey, where there are few vacant rental homes available in hard-hit beach communities, state officials have made the trailers part of a multipronged approach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FEMA and state officials also are renovating the decommissioned Fort Monmouth Army barracks to offer 175 temporary apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What we want to make sure as a state is that the housing needs for all Sandy-displaced victims are met," said Richard Constable, commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs. "Today is a step in that direction."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Jersey's hotel program also was extended to at least Dec. 27, and is now benefiting 2,680 victims.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has long said the trailers were one option in a range of housing for Sandy victims. FEMA has staged 40 of the units at a parking lot here at the Six Flags Great Adventure theme park since early November. An emergency housing task force identified 865 vacancies at 49 mobile home parks where the trailers could be stationed, primarily in Atlantic, Ocean and Monmouth counties along the ocean coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Union Beach Tuesday, about half of 10 Sandy victims interviewed said they were interested in a trailer, even if it meant living in a mobile home park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I would take it because there is no place to live. I would have my own place," said Jamy Ramirez, a 25-year-old mother of two boys, who is staying with a friend in Keansburg, N.J., since her Union Beach rental was damaged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some hoped the trailers could be located near their damaged properties, the units instead will be installed primarily in mobile home parks because federal rules bar them from being placed in flood zones, officials said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They can be used for up to 18 months, said Donna Weise, FEMA's housing group supervisor for New Jersey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trailers will primarily go to homeowners who are rebuilding, as renters are being encouraged to seek out apartments, Ms. Weise said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People will be selected based on factors including how close their job, original home or school district is to a mobile home park.</p>

</div><div class="author">By A.D. Pruitt and Dawn Wotapka </div><div>725 words</div><div>12 December 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of manufactured-housing companies were the big-ticket stocks for real-estate investors in recent years, faithfully posting double-digit annual returns. But now, some investors have soured on the sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks of the biggest operators in the industry, <span class="companylink">Equity LifeStyle Properties Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Sun Communities Inc</span>., delivered negative total returns of about 2.4% and nearly 14%, respectively, in the past three months. That is a significant reversal from the past two years: Equity Lifestyle returned 22% in 2011 and 13% in 2010, while <span class="companylink">Sun Communities</span> returned 20% last year and 86% in 2010, handily beating overall stock-market gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The falling fortunes of manufactured housing appear closely tied to the rising fortunes of traditionally built homes -- and to mortgage rates. Sales of new homes have spiked in recent months and are on track to hit 368,000 this year, well above the 306,000 sold in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, shipments of manufactured homes are declining. In October, 5,100 new manufactured homes were shipped, down from 5,400 in the year-earlier month, according to the latest data available from the Census Bureau. September saw 4,400 shipments, down from 5,100 a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That wasn't what analysts were expecting earlier this year, when some predicted another strong year for manufactured-home sales. The conventional wisdom held that many consumers were seeking less-expensive housing alternatives, and manufactured homes, which often can be purchased for less than half the cost of a traditional home, would serve that purpose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the conventional wisdom didn't factor in finance costs. While mortgages for traditional homes are running at record-low levels -- some rates for 30-year mortgages are below 3.5% -- buyers of manufactured homes are paying much higher finances charges, sometimes topping 10%. Lenders charge higher mortgage rates on manufactured homes in part because the homes tend to lose value over time and lenders can have a hard time foreclosing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Interest rates on manufactured homes are higher because they are viewed more as a depreciated asset like a car or refrigerator or an appliance," said David Toti, an analyst with <span class="companylink">Cantor Fitzgerald</span>. "They're financed more like consumer products," he said, noting that the higher rates and tighter credit have hurt demand for mobile homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lackluster sales have altered the plans of some manufactured-home companies that were expecting such housing to play a bigger role as the housing market remade itself following the crash. "We have set up inventory and feel everything is in place for a real boom in sales," said Sam Landy, president of UMH Properties Inc., a manufactured-home company. "It's not here yet."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Landy, however, remains confident in his business model. He noted new mobile-home sales are up 33% since the bottom of the market in 2009, and as of the third quarter the company sold 71 new homes, the same amount as in all of 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Equity LifeStyle said it maintains that "our customers choose the lifestyle we offer and are not making a decision between a single-family home and one of our communities."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The setbacks are the latest for manufactured housing, which has spent decades battling a "trailer park" image, even though many homes are considered safe, built in a factory and look like traditional homes, with options such as wooden cabinets and walls made from drywall, instead of flimsy paneling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some companies are tweaking their strategy in response to slowing sales by beefing up home rentals and increasingly marketing to recreational-vehicle drivers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monthly rentals now make up 11% of UMH's portfolio, up from less than 9% in 2009. In the third quarter, Equity LifeStyle, which is led by real-estate investor Sam Zell and began increasing its rental program in 2008, increased its rental-home income to $2.1 million in the third quarter, from $1.6 million a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Sun Communities</span> allows renters to apply a percentage of their paid rent toward a down payment on a home. The company sold 395 homes in the third quarter, a 7.6% rise from the prior year. Sun didn't reply to requests for comment.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jim Carlton </div><div>837 words</div><div>12 December 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BAKERSFIELD, Calif. -- This Central Valley oil town, once hard-hit by the sluggish economy and housing slowdown, is helping lead a resurgence in California's construction industry and providing a hopeful sign for many of the state's inland areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the housing boom, lower-cost inland areas like Bakersfield, Modesto and the Inland Empire east of Los Angeles saw home construction surge, only to crash when lending dried up, leaving huge amounts of unsold inventory. But the industry appears on the mend, with construction employment up year-over-year statewide every month since February amid growth in the technology, energy and international-trade industries, among other factors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matt Towery, a 54-year-old home builder, will build 50 homes here this year, versus 24 last year. He is taking his family out to eat more often and plans to buy a replacement soon for a Ford F-350 pickup truck. "We were stung so hard, it's taken us a long time to come back," Mr. Towery said at a new-home site in late November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October, construction employment in California increased by 27,700 jobs, or 5% from a year earlier, according to the <span class="companylink">Associated General Contractors of America</span>, a trade group. California's unemployment in October fell to 10.1% from 11.5% a year earlier, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the construction recovery in the state is broad-based, the hottest market is Bakersfield, a city of about 350,000 more than 100 miles north of Los Angeles. Surrounding Kern County is one of the biggest oil-producing places in the country, with nearly 40,000 working wells -- many within the city itself -- that account for the bulk of California's crude output. The city also has become a hub for warehouses and industrial parks that serve Southern California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial and residential construction jobs in the Bakersfield metro area rose 5% in October from a year earlier, one of the strongest growth rates in the nation, according to the contractors' group. After losing 40,000 total jobs -- including 39% of construction jobs -- between 2007 and 2010, the Bakersfield area has regained all but about 3,000, according to state data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not any one thing, but a lot of things adding up," said John Emery, dean of the school of business and public administration at California State University, Bakersfield. "It's a great time to be here."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists warn that Bakersfield, like California, isn't out of the woods. Kern County's October unemployment rate of 12.2%, while down from 13.5% a year earlier, exceeded both the state and U.S. rate. And despite a rebound in housing starts here and statewide, the markets remain well below prerecession levels. Median prices for an existing single-family home plunged 61% in Kern County between 2006 and 2009, and they have rebounded to 48% below 2006 levels, according to the <span class="companylink">California Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Restoring construction is important, economists say, because it generates many other jobs. Randy Salcido, a plasterer on a three-bedroom project of home builder Mr. Towery, said he and his wife have begun going to movies again after he regained his job three months ago after being sporadically employed since 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearby, workers put finishing touches on a four-story cancer center for <span class="companylink">San Joaquin Community Hospital</span>. An improving economy helped the hospital raise $5 million in donations of the $36.5 million needed for the project, which broke ground in 2011, said Jarrod McNaughton, a hospital vice president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A more-than-doubling of oil prices since late 2008 and increases in California's foreign trade have helped accelerate construction at a 1,400-acre industrial park outside Bakersfield owned by <span class="companylink">Roll Global LLC</span>. The Los Angeles company has leased 250 acres for warehouse construction to energy and other companies over just the past 18 months, compared with 300 acres over the prior decade, said John Ritchie, vice president of commercial development for a Roll division.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One recent deal was for construction of a 55,000-square-foot facility for <span class="companylink">Weatherford International Ltd</span>., a Swiss oil-field-services firm, to make drilling equipment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When oil goes up, you see people reinvesting," said Les Clark, executive vice president of the Independent Oil Producers' Agency in Bakersfield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid the commercial-building uptick, countywide permits for single-family housing have more than doubled this year to more than 900, although that is still less than one-fifth the 2006 peak of 6,000, according to county data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bakersfield's <span class="companylink">Lenox Homes</span> went from building 500 homes in 2005 to 69 in 2010, and it is back up to about 100 this year. "At the end of the day," said David Cates, <span class="companylink">Lenox Homes</span>' president, "we survived."</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Home Builders Seen Tapping Public Market --- Plans by Taylor Morrison for an IPO Could Signal Beginning of a Trend, as Housing Construction Continues to Surge</span>
</div><div class="author">By Robbie Whelan </div><div>751 words</div><div>12 December 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plans by home builder Taylor Morrison to sell stock in an initial public offering could be the first in a wave of private builders going public, a trend that could alter the ranks of the nation's top builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taylor Morrison, based in Scottsdale, Ariz., and which builds mainly higher-end homes in states from Florida to California, was a unit of British conglomerate <span class="companylink">Taylor Wimpey PLC</span> until early 2011, when it was sold for nearly $1 billion to a group of U.S. private-equity funds. Last week, those funds filed a prospectus to sell $250 million of shares to the public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alex Barron, an independent analyst with the Housing Research Center in El Paso, Texas, said now is "an ideal time for a company like Taylor Morrison to consider going public," because investor appetite for builder stocks is strong and new-home sales and prices are on the rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction Index, which tracks seven publicly traded builders, is up 70% so far this year, although it has given back some of its gains in the past month. Sales of new homes hit a four-year high in September, and the $237,700 median sales price of a new home in October was 7% higher than in 2010, according to the Census Bureau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Taylor Morrison's IPO is completed, the company would be the sixth-largest publicly traded home builder in the U.S. based on 2011 revenue, ahead of <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> and behind <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers Inc</span>. It also would be the first home builder to go public in more than 15 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts say other private builders could follow. "There are at least five other home builders that are owned by hedge funds that will be likely to take them public over the next three years," said John Burns, an Irvine, Calif., builder consultant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stocks of public builders are trading at nearly twice their book values, meaning most builders right now are worth more as public companies than they would be as private ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another factor is credit. Banks, insurance companies and other traditional lenders have been reluctant to lend to private builders, even those with good financials, since getting burned in the housing downturn. But builders can raise debt and equity more easily and cheaply on the public market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The funds that own Taylor Morrison -- TPG Holdings, <span class="companylink">Oaktree Capital Management LP</span> and JH Investments Inc. -- believe the company is worth about twice the price they paid for it, and they plan to hold onto the majority of its equity for the next few years, according to a person with knowledge of the firms' plans. The firms are likely to sell their full stakes as the market recovers and if prices rise further, the person said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taylor Morrison is known for carrying a large supply of land on its books, much of it in attractive locations in strengthening markets such as Phoenix, Houston and Austin, Texas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some companies that have been mentioned as possible candidates to go public include <span class="companylink">Dominion Homes Inc</span>. in Dublin, Ohio, whose debt was bought by hedge funds Silver Point Finance and <span class="companylink">Angelo Gordon &amp; Co</span>.; <span class="companylink">William Lyon Homes</span> of Newport Beach, Calif., which got a lifeline from <span class="companylink">Colony Capital LLC</span> and Woodside Homes, of Texas, which recently received a $203 million capital infusion from Oaktree and Stonehill Capital Management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matthew R. Zaist, a vice president at William Lyon, said the company doesn't have immediate plans for an IPO, but the builder's "executive officers and board of directors will continue to monitor the equity markets and make a determination when we feel an IPO is in the best interest of our shareholders."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We'd certainly look at an IPO at the right time, but we're not looking at it right now," said Joel Shine, Woodside's chief executive, noting that the company has enough cash from its recent recapitalization to carry out its business plan. "We went from our worst year ever to our second-worst year ever. We've got a long way to go until we reach a healthy, normal market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dominion didn't return calls seeking comment.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos </div><div>940 words</div><div>10 December 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An inspector general's report is bringing renewed scrutiny to the pay levels of hundreds of senior managers at <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> who earned more than $200,000 last year, a time when Congress threatened to sharply cut the pay of rank-and-file employees by putting the firms on federal wage scales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report from the inspector general for the Federal Housing Finance Agency, slated for release on Monday, looked at the 2011 take-home pay for some 2,000 senior but nonexecutive employees. While executive pay at Fannie and Freddie has received close examination, figures for the next-highest earners haven't previously been disclosed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report found that 333 employees at the "vice president" level had median pay of $388,000, meaning half were paid more and half were paid less. Some 1,650 employees at the "director" level had median pay of $205,300. Those 2,000 employees account for roughly one-sixth of the workforce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The "vice president" and "director" salaries are on par with comparable private-sector jobs in the financial sector, but they are higher than wages received by most government workers, including those employed at the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report found that median pay to executive vice presidents and senior vice presidents had fallen in 2011 by around 9% and 5%, respectively. But median pay for the vice president and director-level positions had increased by 5% in 2010 and another 4% in 2011, largely the result of one-time retention bonuses approved in 2009 that were paid in installments in 2010 and 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FHFA said in a written response included in the report that its own compensation measures, which are different from those used by the inspector general, show "significant changes" to compensation levels that weren't reflected in the report because the inspector general's analysis included deferred pay from previous years that was collected in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representatives for the FHFA and Freddie declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Fannie Mae spokeswoman declined to comment on the report's specific findings but defended the company's compensation practices in a statement. "Our employees are managing. . .significant risk in an operationally complex market," said Kelli Parsons, Fannie's chief communications officer. "It is absolutely critical that our compensation is competitive in the market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fannie and Freddie were taken over by the government four years ago through a legal process known as conservatorship. The mortgage giants have cost taxpayers around $137 billion as a result, but both have posted considerable profits this year. In October, the FHFA projected that that total cost could fall to $76 billion by the end of 2015 as the firms' profits are swept away by the government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics in Congress have said employees should face lean pay days now that their operations have been effectively nationalized. "These companies are owned by taxpayers and their staff should be paid accordingly," Rep. Spencer Bachus (R., Ala.), the chairman of the <span class="companylink">House Financial Services Committee</span>, said in a March statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tim Rood, a former Fannie executive and partner at the Collingwood Group, a housing-finance consultancy, said, "The director and vice president level employees are paid more than handsomely." But as the companies face a steady brain drain with long-tenured veterans leaving, Mr. Rood said the high pay scales could be justified.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The top 90 executives at the firms took home a combined $92 million. The median pay to 23 executive vice presidents between both companies stood at $1.7 million while the median pay for 62 senior vice presidents was $723,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FHFA instituted companywide pay freezes two years ago. After an uproar in Congress over bonuses last year, the agency earlier this year also unveiled a new executive compensation program, replacing performance-based pay incentives with deferred pay that is fixed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inspector general's office didn't offer any judgment about the appropriateness of the compensation but instead recommended that the FHFA develop a "long term plan" to strengthen oversight of nonexecutive compensation. In contrast to executive pay, oversight of nonexecutive pay has been "limited" and the agency hasn't "reviewed, examined, or tested" the companies pay processes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fannie and Freddie guarantee $5 trillion in outstanding mortgages, including $1.2 trillion that are on their balance sheets, and are responsible for funding around two in three new mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Given the amount of money at risk here, small mistakes can easily be amplified to losses far greater than the compensation paid," said Edward DeMarco, the FHFA's acting director, in congressional testimony last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, Fannie and Freddie offered not just attractive pay packages but also a level of stability and prestige that has been eroded as a result of their government control. The inspector general's report shows that voluntary attrition rates among executives spiked to around 20% in 2009, the year following conservatorship, and again last year, first after the White House proposed winding down the companies and later amid increased calls to cap pay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> warned in federal filings last month that high employee turnover in its information-technology division late last year created a "material weakness" in its financial reporting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A congressional committee last year passed a bill on a 52-4 vote to put employees at both companies on a federal pay scale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the bill ultimately became law, "I think the management teams at both companies would walk out," Mr. DeMarco told reporters earlier this year.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Tom Lauricella </div><div>1019 words</div><div>10 December 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate investment trusts are closing out another strong year, benefiting from their status as higher-yielding investments in a world of meager interest rates. But some fund managers say REITs are getting less appealing even as they grow more popular.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a story playing out across the financial markets. With interest rates on government debt at rock-bottom levels, investors are pouring money into higher-yielding investments. That demand is pushing up prices so much that some investors worry that the yield advantages aren't worth the risks that come with the higher prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After years of big gains -- the MSCI U.S. REIT Index is up an average of 19% a year for the past three years when dividends are included -- money managers and analysts say bargains are hard to find.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"U.S. REITs look less attractive to us now than they have over the last 10 years," said Richard Levine, one of the portfolio managers on the $2.7 billion <span class="companylink">Neuberger Berman</span> Equity Income Fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs own and operate a wide range of commercial real estate, from hotels and hospitals to apartments and storage units. Under U.S. tax laws, they are required to distribute to shareholders at least 90% of their taxable income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs are up 15% this year. <span class="companylink">Simon Property Group</span>, one of the most widely held REITs, is up 24% including dividends. <span class="companylink">Ventas Inc</span>., a health-care property company, is up 18%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dividends paid by companies in the MSCI U.S. REIT index have been running at about a 3.4% yield, higher than some investment-grade corporate debt and well above government-bond yields. REITs also have benefited as a play on a slowly recovering real-estate market. Other investors are looking to commercial real estate as a way to protect against inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after enjoying a big run, fund managers say they are being choosier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historically, Mr. Levine's fund averages around 25% of its assets in REITs. But these days they comprise around 17%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As people have looked for the next source of yield they've found REITs, so they've done nicely," said Mr. Levine. "But that's been pushing valuations to levels which are unattractive in some cases."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some investors say they are turning more cautious on groups such as health-care REITs, which have posted big gains. These REITs, which own and manage properties such as nursing homes and hospitals, have benefited from high yields and a view that they are immune to ups and downs in the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, investors are looking to niches that have lagged, such as apartment companies that have suffered amid worries about competition from a stabilizing housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, while they are less enthusiastic about REITs, fund managers and analysts say they aren't completely bearish. Low interest rates, little new construction and steady economic growth are positive for REITs, they say. Valuations, while not a steal, are deemed reasonable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morley Campbell, portfolio manager at NFJ Investment Group, which manages $37 billion, said he wouldn't count himself as bullish on REITs. But, he said, "we're finding pockets of opportunity." He points to <span class="companylink">Retail Properties of America</span>, which is up 51% since going public in April and yields 5.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors tend to measure REIT valuation against both stocks and bonds. The results there paint a mixed picture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs are typically valued using their prices compared with adjusted funds from operation, or AFFO, a net-income measure tailored for real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On that basis, REITs are trading at 18 times their stock price using three-year forward AFFO expectations, according to Green Street Advisors, a research firm in Newport Beach, Calif., compared with an average of 15 times since 1998. The AFFO valuation also exceeds the ratio of the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index, which trades at 13 times companies' next-12-months earnings, according to FactSet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In general, REITs look attractive compared to bonds. They offer more than two percentage points of extra yield compared with the 10-year <span class="companylink">U.S. Treasury</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many REIT specialists compare the sector's yields against corporate bonds using a common real-estate metric, known as the capitalization rate. The so-called cap rate is essentially the ratio between the amount of income that properties generate and the property value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cap rate based on share prices for five major property sectors of publicly traded REITs is around 6%, according to Green Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is about 1.4% more than the average Baa-rated corporate bond, well above the 0.7% average since 1998, according to Green Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott Craig, manager of the $35 million Eaton Vance Real Estate fund, and other fund managers are eschewing expensive stocks such as health-care REITs and focusing on sectors that have lagged behind the most recent rally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are looking at apartment REITs, which are up about 4% this year following a 15% gain in 2011, according to data from the <span class="companylink">National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Lee, manager of the $3.6 billion <span class="companylink">T. Rowe Price Real Estate</span> fund, said apartment REITs have been held back by a belief that a nascent recovery in residential real estate will hit demand for apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, there are concerns that new apartment construction will trim profitability. But he thinks those fears are exaggerated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People believe it's a zero-sum game, that if the for-sale housing market is doing well, then rentals will not do as well," said Mr. Lee, who counted apartment REIT AvalonBay as his fund's third-largest holding at the end of September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a housing recovery is good news for the economy and therefore good news for rental properties, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is especially the case since he expects homeownership to remain well below the pre-bubble peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It can be a win-win situation," he said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Roland Li </div><div>941 words</div><div>10 December 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A26</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent night out, restaurants and bars up and down the street were packed and a few even had lines of revelers waiting to get in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this wasn't the trendy Meatpacking District or Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Rather it was downtown Stamford, Conn., which is gaining traction in becoming a 24-hour community with retail, housing and night life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 1,600 new residential units have been developed in downtown Stamford since 2010 and another 1,300 are planned, according to Marcus &amp; Millichap, a commercial real-estate brokerage. The vacancy rate of the city's 1.7 million square feet of retail space is below the national average of about 10%, according to <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>., a real-estate data firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city's nocturnal heart -- along Summer, Bedford, Main and Broad streets -- has about 80 bars and restaurants, many which have opened in the past two years. "It's hard to keep up," said lifelong Stamford resident Cory Carswell, 23 years old, as he stood in line outside of the Brick House Bar &amp; Grill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small cities throughout the New York region -- especially those with train stations -- have been trying to boost retail, residential and entertainment development with varying degrees of success. Stamford has been doing better than others, attracting a new <span class="companylink">Fairway Market</span> in 2010 and a 400,000-square-foot Chelsea Piers athletic complex in a converted <span class="companylink">Clairol</span> factory, which opened in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stamford's population has increased to 123,868 people in 2011, compared with 117,083 in 2000, according to the <span class="companylink">U.S. Census Bureau</span>. That gives the city a "critical mass" necessary to support dry cleaners, groceries and other retail needed by residents, says Christopher Jones, vice president of research at the Regional Plan Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's certainly been one of the national success stories for downtown revitalization," Mr. Jones says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, Stamford still faces challenges, including a fragile regional job market. Its vacancy rate for top quality office space was 23.7% in the third quarter, one of the highest in the region, down from the 26.2% rate in the second quarter, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield. "It still is overall a soft office market," says Jay Hruska, an executive vice president at the brokerage's Stamford office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York City used to be a steady source of office tenants for Stamford as businesses fled the problems of urban living. But as the quality of life in New York improved, that flow slowed and even showed signs of reversing. Last year the Swiss banking giant <span class="companylink">UBS AG</span>, which moved to Stamford about 10 years ago, came close to deciding to move back to Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the state has been aggressive in luring businesses with incentives, like the $20 million offered to <span class="companylink">UBS</span> to convince it to stay. <span class="companylink">Comcast Corp</span>.'s NBC Sports division moved from Manhattan to a 32-acre site in Stamford earlier in the fall, a deal which included a $20 million state loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Charter Communications</span>, the fourth-largest U.S. cable operator, said in October that it would move its corporate headquarters from St. Louis to Stamford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stamford has a long history of urban-renewal efforts. Much of the downtown was demolished in the 1960s, making way for developers like F.D. Rich Co. to build a swath of office towers. Over the years, the city attracted numerous big-name companies including <span class="companylink">GTE Corp</span>., a predecessor to <span class="companylink">Verizon Communications Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Scotland Group</span> and <span class="companylink">UBS</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently, a blighted 80-acre industrial site on Stamford's south side is becoming a massive new mixed-use community called Harbor Point, scheduled for completion in 2016. About 95% of 890 apartments in the first three rental buildings have been leased at rents of about $2,100 per month for a 700-square-foot apartment. A 242-unit building that opened a few months ago is now 50% leased. New residents have been drawn by the area's 12 acres of public parks and a mile of waterfront access along Stamford Harbor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harbor Point also has attracted such office tenants as <span class="companylink">Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts Worldwide Inc</span>. and retail tenants like Fairway and <span class="companylink">Dinosaur Bar-B-Que</span>, which opened earlier this month. Starwood's chief administrative officer, Ken Siegel, says state incentives helped lure the company from its old headquarters in White Plains, N.Y. It was "the classic offer you can't refuse," he says. Also, the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates is considering building a $750 million headquarters near the waterfront at Harbor Point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, other residential projects in other parts of the city are doing well. Parallel 41, a 124-unit building located two blocks from Summer Street, is 70% leased after marketing began in June, according to Randy Salvatore, president of its developer RMS Construction. RMS has another 58-unit apartment tower under construction and a 60-unit building undergoing approvals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2009, when Andy Pforzheimer opened the Barcelona Wine Bar downtown, he says restaurants were struggling. But last year he opened another restaurant next door, Bartaco. "We took a gamble," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Night life also has been boosted by a business-improvement group named the Stamford Downtown Special Services District that sponsors free summer concerts and expanded Stamford's Thanksgiving Parade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When I started, it was truly lights out at 5 o' clock," said Mr. Hruska of Cushman &amp; Wakefield, who has been working around Stamford for nearly 30 years. "No question, it's a more vibrant place."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sarah Tilton </div><div>1060 words</div><div>7 December 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Railroad executive and real-estate developer Kern Schumacher started coming to Lake Tahoe in the 1950s and bought a property in the then-sleepy town of Incline Village, Nev., in 1971, attracted to "the combination of beauty and low taxes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On what's now considered a prime lakefront spot on prestigious Lakeshore Boulevard, Mr. Schumacher built a 12,900-square-foot contemporary style house, restored an existing 1952 guesthouse and added another guesthouse. His property has a pier with eight boat lifts, a tennis court, a beach-volleyball court, a creek and two ponds stocked with trout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, he has a more glittery group of neighbors as well. Lakeshore's homeowners include former junk-bond king Michael Milken, Sun Microsystems co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim and <span class="companylink">Commerce One</span> co-founder Tom Gonzales. <span class="companylink">Oracle</span> billionaire Larry Ellison owns a number of properties on Lakeshore; PeopleSoft founder and Workday Co-CEO David Duffield has snapped up a number of properties on and around the street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I have no complaints, you couldn't ask for better neighbors," says Mr. Schumacher. Last summer, he hosted the League to Save Lake Tahoe benefit, the first time the event was held at Incline, attracting San Francisco philanthropist Dede Wilsey and Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lumber settlement in the 1800s -- and a setting for the fictitious Ponderosa Ranch in the old Bonanza television series -- Incline Village has become a hot spot for wealthy Bay Area buyers looking for the mountain lifestyle -- which includes water-skiing in summer and snow skiing in winter -- as well as Nevada's favorable tax codes. Nevada has no state personal, business or corporate income tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real-estate market in Incline Village is "the bright spot at Lake Tahoe," says Kerry Donovan, an agent with Chase International who attributes the strength in Incline to its year-round resort lifestyle and easy access to the San Francisco Bay area, via two highways and nearby airports that service both commercial and private jets. Sales of single-family Incline Village homes over $1 million were up 46% for the first nine months of 2012 compared with the same period in 2011. The average sale price for a single-family home in Incline was $982,548 for the first nine months of 2012, down 10% from the same period in 2011 but higher than the average of $538,289 for the entire Lake Tahoe area. Susan Lowe, also of Chase International, attributes the lower average price to a "clearing out of distressed properties" that were generated by the downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the top end of the market, prices remain high. The Lakeshore Boulevard estate of the late inventor Jerome Lemelson went into contract last month after being on the market for $29.5 million. The 8-acre property has a pier, private beach, main house, conference center and guesthouse. Mr. Gonzales of <span class="companylink">Commerce One</span> has his 4.35-acre compound on the market with an asking price of $49.9 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schumacher prefers skiing in Aspen or Deer Valley in the winter as the snow there is drier and his homes there are ski-in and ski-out. Still, in good weather it's less than 10 minutes from his house to the Diamond Peak Ski Resort where skiers can enjoy views of the lake as they come down the mountain. It's less than 20 minutes to the runs at Mount Rose Ski Tahoe which has a base elevation of 8,260 feet, and about 30 minutes to the Northstar-at-Tahoe resort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Longtime Incline resident Maryanne Ingemanson, who lives in an approximately 5,000-square-foot waterfront house that was built in 1949 and which still has the original stone fireplace, says she watched Incline grow up. "It was just a big forest," she says of Incline in 1960, when it had no school or grocery store. "There was no big highway going to Sacramento."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Ingemanson is well aware of one downside of all the gentrification. She heads the Village League to Save Incline Assets, a nonprofit organization that filed 26 lawsuits and won six Nevada Supreme Court decisions to force Washoe County to refund $43 million in property taxes to residents including herself and Messrs. Milken, Duffield and Ellison. The group argued that assessments should be "equalized" with those of a nearby county, which has comparable homes abutting the lake but assessments up to 50% lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nathan Hamilton moved his family from the Bay Area to Incline Village in 2004. "We moved for the lifestyle and the taxes," says Mr. Hamilton, the CEO of Juvenon, a maker of nutritional supplements. While Incline started as a second home for them, Mr. Hamilton says that thanks to the Internet and the proximity to San Francisco, it was possible to make it their full-time residence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I thought I'd live 10 years longer if I moved to Incline," he says, citing the healthy lifestyle here. Mr. Hamilton says that in the winter he can go skiing for an hour at lunch. In the summer he can water-ski before work. Like all residents of Incline Village, he also has access to the town's facilities, including two golf courses, three private beaches and a 37,000-square-foot recreation center with an Olympic-size pool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked if there is any downside to life in Incline Village, Mr. Hamilton takes a moment to answer. "There's no zoo," says the father of three young children.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Dawn Wotapka </div><div>1570 words</div><div>7 December 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residents at a new rental community in Orlando, Fla., lounge around a resort-style pool in private cabanas. They practice their golf swings at the putting green and meditate in a Zen garden. Videogamers sip complimentary coffee while playing "Call of Duty: Black Ops II" on a multiscreen television wall. Now, they're facing final exams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Welcome to University House, a $65 million private college dormitory that just opened near the University of Central Florida. Built by Inland American Communities Group, University House is one of the latest upscale communities sprouting up in college towns -- including East Lansing, Mich., Tempe, Ariz., College Station, Texas, and others. Developers say that colleges provide a steady stream of new customers every year, and that students -- and their parents -- are willing to pay for luxury amenities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of bunk beds, cinder-block walls and communal showers, these newly built dorms off campus resemble apartments and offer a wide range of amenities, such as walk in-closets and custom-designed furniture. Everyone usually gets his or her own bedroom and bathroom, so the only sharing is in the high-end kitchens that often feature granite countertops and stainless-steel appliances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate investors and developers, hungry for new areas for growth, are finding a lucrative and previously untapped market in these areas surrounding college campuses, one marked by low inventory, booming enrollment and an increasing appetite for luxury living.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, the <span class="companylink">University of Kentucky</span> made news when it began turning over its 6,000 beds and apartments to the publicly held Education Realty Trust, or EdR, for updating and expansion. Much of the existing housing stock will likely be razed and rebuilt. Some 600 additional beds will be ready in August and 2,300 more will be available in 2014. EdR, which has purchased or developed $2.4 billion worth of student housing since 2000, controls housing for about 38,000 students nationwide. The <span class="companylink">University of Kentucky</span> receives a percentage of gross revenue -- which varies by residence hall -- and a percentage of EdR's net income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, major companies left student housing to mom-and-pop operators. But that changed with the 2004 initial public offering of American Campus Communities, which is now the sector's largest player, owning or managing nearly 123,000 beds. Campus Crest Communities went public in October 2010 and now has nearly 21,000 beds, with roughly 3,500 more in the works. Inland American Communities, part of a diversified REIT that branched into student housing in 2007, has about 4,000 beds and would like to double its presence in the space within the next three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many schools generally require freshmen to live on campus in university-run housing. After that -- or when there isn't enough room for freshmen -- students can usually move off campus. Developers of privately run off-campus housing typically don't share revenue with colleges, even though they operate much the same as college-run housing. The communities are open only to students, each of whom signs and individual lease. Some even use resident assistants to help with everything from study tips to roommate issues. Campus Crest, for example, typically employs nine such assistants -- dubbed "Rock Stars" -- per property, and their rent is covered in exchange for 20 hours of work each week. At an average rent of $485 per room, that's a benefit worth $5,820 a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both students and administrators say housing has become a big factor in college selection, increasingly trumping degree programs or beloved sports teams. Mark Sampson says his daughter took "about two looks at the campus" of University of Florida in Gainesville and declared it too old. She picked University of Central Florida and hopes to move into University House this fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These flashy residences aren't cheap. At University House, located off campus, rates start at $665 per person, per month for a four-bedroom, four-bath unit. A student who wants to live solo in a one-bedroom unit pays nearly $1,000 a month. By comparison, two students can share a traditional dorm room on campus for about $550 each a month for the academic year. An on-campus apartment with four bedrooms and four baths costs each resident more than $800 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On campus, "you never got your privacy," says Nicole Ibinarriaga, a 20-year-old junior whose parents pay her $690 monthly rent, which includes parking, at the University House, where she lives in a three bedroom, three-bathroom unit with two other women. "Now, I can take a five-hour shower and not worry about it, or take a bubble bath."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many schools -- particularly public ones -- say such luxury living won't likely find its way onto their campuses. "Our facilities are tasteful. They're as attractive as you're going to be able to find anywhere. They're not resorts," says Eli Capilouto, Kentucky's president. "We want something modern infused with technology, but not priced beyond the means of the people we're charged to serve."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Educators often require or encourage underclassmen, particularly freshmen, to live on campus. But, in many cases, there aren't enough beds to go around. This is only getting worse as the "echo boomers" -- children of baby boomers -- continue reaching college age. More than three million high-school seniors are expected to graduate each year until the 2018-19 academic year, and many of them will pursue higher education. Kentucky has just 5,200 beds for more than 28,000 students, while Central Florida has nearly 60,000 students enrolled. <span class="companylink">Arizona State University</span>, one of the nation's largest schools by enrollment, has 13,000 beds for nearly 74,000 students across four campuses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers are profiting from this imbalance. Residences for more than 30,000 beds are estimated to be under construction around campuses nationwide, though the industry's fragmentation makes an accurate count difficult. These builders rely on amenities to stand out. At the Lodges of East Lansing near <span class="companylink">Michigan State University</span>, the pool is heated year-round, and there's an ice-skating rink just for students. During the week, a private shuttle bus takes students to class. On the weekends, they're driven to and from night-life hot spots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Cottages of College Station near the <span class="companylink">Texas A&amp;M University</span> campus in College Station, Texas, the two-story clubhouse's wood-shingle exterior resembles a tony Hamptons mansion. "Most of these kids are going to have a step down in lifestyle when they have to enter the working-world environment after they graduate," says John E. Vawter, principal of Capstone Collegiate Communities, which developed the Lodges and the Cottages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The District on Apache, a 1,200-bed student-housing community set to open within walking distance of Arizona State next year, will feature an oversize outdoor movie screen, steam rooms and a 300-foot-long "lazy river" water feature, according to architect Mark Humphreys, whose firm designed University House.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Student-housing rental rates typically include furnishings, high-speed Internet, cable television and utilities. Ted Rollins, chief executive of Campus Crest, estimates each community's power bill tops $300,000 annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This off-campus building boom is forcing schools to up their game, though slashed budgets have left minimal funds to erect new residence halls. With just a few hundred beds on campus, the University of Central Florida was long known as a commuter college. When John Hitt became president in 1992, he vowed to change that. Since then, the bed count has increased to about 11,300, with about 700 more under construction. All these beds will be one per room, though some students will have to share bathrooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They don't have to be the super-sexiest facilities you've ever seen, but there's a competitive market out there," he said. "The schools that have the more modern arrangements, I think that makes a difference."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even the best amenities won't protect developers and owners if more students decide to live at home to save money, increasingly likely as students and parents cope with student debt. There is also the increasing availability of distance learning, which allows students to take classes without setting foot on campus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then there's the risk of a glut as more competitors enter the marketplace. University House is near another residence called Sterling Central, which opened over the past two years and now has about 1,500 beds. Nearby, American Campus owns the 930-bed Edge and has another 1,300-bed project under way that should open in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sterling Central, which boasts four pools, puts a 32-inch flat-screen television in every bedroom and often bakes cookies for residents to share in common areas, saw its occupancy fall to about 86% this academic year, from 98% last year, as students fled to the newer University House, says Bria Ivanoff, Sterling's community manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's new property after new property going up," she says. "It's only a matter of time before the market becomes oversaturated."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Ted Mann </div><div>778 words</div><div>6 December 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A21</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York state officials on Wednesday unveiled renderings of three proposed designs for a new Tappan Zee Bridge, less than two weeks before the Thruway Authority is expected to announce a winning bid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A state selection committee recommended the least expensive option, a $3.1 billion twin-span design that could be built in about five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's staff refused to comment on the identity of the low bidder, the state had previously selected a joint venture led by Fluor Enterprises Inc. for intensive negotiations on the bridge deal, giving that group the inside track to win the contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, one person familiar with the discussions said the <span class="companylink">Fluor</span>-led group, known as Tappan Zee Constructors, is expected to be chosen when the Thruway Authority's board of directors votes on Dec. 17.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The selection committee, which was charged with weighing technical and aesthetic details of the proposed designs, chose the lower bid over two others estimated at $4 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively. News of the designs came out of a meeting of Mr. Cuomo's cabinet in Albany.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Administration officials didn't identify which design team provided each of the proposals, and the selection committee's recommendation is nonbinding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The governor said the move toward a final selection was a validation of his administration's push to jump-start construction of a replacement for the aging span, noting that the state was close to selecting a design after roughly a year of work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It can take a year to buy a new desk in this place," Mr. Cuomo said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wall Street Journal reported in October that the state had focused its negotiations on one group of bidders, a joint venture of <span class="companylink">Fluor</span>, <span class="companylink">American Bridge Co</span>., Granite Construction Northeast Inc. and <span class="companylink">Traylor Bros. Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, people familiar with the state's communications to the other groups -- a joint venture of <span class="companylink">Bechtel Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Tutor Perini Corp</span>.; and a partnership of Kiewit Infrastructure Co., <span class="companylink">Skanska USA Civil Northeast Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Weeks Marine Inc</span>. -- said they had been informed the Cuomo administration would not request future negotiations on the bridge project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All the proposals would roughly double the total width of the existing Tappan Zee Bridge, carrying eight lanes of traffic and adding a rush-hour bus lane, wide shoulders and a crossing for pedestrians and bicycles. Mr. Cuomo has said the bridge would be built with the capability of carrying a future mass-transit link across the Hudson River, a promise that hasn't allayed the concerns of transportation advocates who say that a rail or bus-rapid transit element should be incorporated in the bridge from its opening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many unanswered questions also hang over the financing of the multibillion-dollar infrastructure project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Cuomo administration has requested a federal loan for as much as 49% of the cost of the new bridge, but most scenarios would likely involve raising bridge tolls to cover remaining costs. The state could see up to $800 million in additional costs related to the construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The administration has said a formal financing plan won't be finished or made public until after establishing a final price for the winning contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've requested a very large loan from the federal government to build the bridge," Mr. Cuomo said. "That is the big question mark right now. We needed to know how much the cost of the bridge was. It depends on which bridge the Thruway Authority ultimately picks."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The selection committee included artists and design experts such as sculptor Jeff Koons, architect Richard Meier and Thomas Campbell, director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The board now has the option to choose from among those three proposals, but I think it plays a heavy role in the decision-making process," Thruway Authority Executive Director Thomas Madison said at the cabinet meeting, referring to the committee's choice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $3.1 billion low bid was a rarity for the Tappan Zee project -- a firm cost estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the administration previously used estimates that hovered around $5 billion and suggested in a loan application that the bridge's cost could range as high as $6 billion, the actual projected cost of Mr. Cuomo's key infrastructure-building initiative had remained murky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think it looks beautiful," said the governor's secretary, Larry Schwartz, "and I love the price."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nupur Acharya </div><div>966 words</div><div>5 December 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C12</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MUMBAI -- India's financial capital is built on a peninsula that narrows sharply at its southern tip, a geography not dissimilar to Manhattan. And like some New York banks that have left Wall Street for Midtown, Mumbai's financial elite are heading north.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the city's largest financial institutions and companies are giving up on the chaotic south of the city -- home to crumbling buildings from the British Raj and to drab 1960s tower blocks -- and moving to an area known as the Bandra Kurla Complex, or BKC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Global banks such as <span class="companylink">Citigroup Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Standard Chartered PLC</span> and UBS AG are among companies that have bought or rented offices in gleaming buildings in BKC in the past few years. They followed Indian banks, companies and the country's largest stock exchange, which already had set up there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Consulate and international schools have moved to the area. There is an open area used for concerts and trade fairs. A large complex including a drive-in cinema and shopping mall is under construction. Future plans involve building more residential complexes of high-end houses and apartments on empty lots that scatter the site. Las Vegas hotels the Bellagio and MGM Grand, <span class="companylink">MGM Resorts International</span>, are planning to open hotels in the area within a few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The complex boasts broad sidewalks and roads, and street-side vendors are barred, a contrast to Nariman Point, the city's traditional business district in the south that until a few years ago was home to some of the world's priciest real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BKC isn't without problems. Like much of Mumbai, vacancy rates in offices are running at 20% as India's slowing economic growth has led to an oversupply. The areas outside the complex, including Dharavi, one of Asia's largest slums, remain extremely poor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lack of adequate public transportation and food outlets is a drawback, workers say. At night, it can seem like a ghost town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many real-estate agents and business people say BKC rental prices, which have tripled in the past decade as other Mumbai rents have slipped, are set to continue to climb as the area offers the best opportunity to build a new financial district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I feel the center of Mumbai has moved out of south Mumbai," said Uday Kotak, managing director of Kotak Mahindra Bank. "The center will be Bandra Kurla."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mumbai city planners knew from the 1970s that they were running out of space at Nariman Point. The area overlooking the Arabian Sea still has near-constant traffic, as cars and hawkers dragging carts compete for space. Companies in the area often have to make do with offices in decrepit buildings, without adequate parking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mumbai Metropolitan Regional Development Authority developed BKC on an uninhabited marshy area bounded by a polluted creek, not far from the city's international airport. It drained the area, and some Indian government departments became early tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn't until more than a decade later that BKC began to take shape, as India's market-opening measures of 1991 pumped the economy. The development authority began auctioning land to private developers, which looked to attract Indian companies and financial institutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a decade ago, BKC still was largely empty and rents in Nariman Point continued to soar as Indian and foreign companies sought to expand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At its peak in year 2008, rentals at Nariman Point for top-quality office blocks touched 475 rupees a square foot per month, the equivalent of almost $900,000 for a 100,000-square-foot office space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This price escalation spurred interest in BKC, where rentals a decade ago were about a quarter of the rent at Nariman Point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, rents in BKC and Nariman Point are both around 280 rupees a square foot per month. In BKC, a 100,000-square-foot office will rent for about $545,000 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That rental level makes it more expensive than business districts in Taipei, Seoul and Sydney, and comparable to Perth and Singapore, according to <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>, a real-estate services firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some real-estate participants say city planners will have to ensure BKC gets more high-quality residences and shops for the area to continue attracting people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The authorities will have to plan for the future," said Ramesh Nair, managing director for west India at <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there is no sign the area's growth is slowing. In part, that is because of few alternatives. Efforts to build a new business district out of an area of former textile mills in Lower Parel, between Nariman Point and BKC, have stalled largely because of congestion problems in the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"BKC is a planned development unlike the central Mumbai area where infrastructure is a problem," said Samantak Das, a Mumbai-based director of research for Knight Frank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>, one of the first foreign banks to move to BKC from Nariman Point, paid $187.23 million earlier this year to buy an additional 297,000 square feet of space. The bank, like many other companies, still maintains a representative office in south Mumbai.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, BKC has a total of eight million square feet of office space. An additional 2.5 million square feet should be available by the end of this year with the planned completion of three new office complexes. <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> and <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank AG</span> are anchor tenants in two of the new developments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The rentals are likely to go up further in 2013-2014 as there is likely to be a lag before the next supply comes in around 2015," Mr. Nair said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Josh Barbanel </div><div>865 words</div><div>4 December 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A22</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Superstorm Sandy wrecked the basement of a large warehouse with cast-iron-columns that was in the midst of a condo conversion in TriBeCa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But soon after the water was pumped out -- when the building had no heat and limited electricity powered by a generator -- buyers started coming back in force: Since Sandy, two deals were struck for apartments worth a total of more than $7.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deals and the steady stream of potential buyers -- an average a four a day have come through the show room at the former warehouse at 250 West St. -- show how a strong downtown condo market is overpowering some qualms about the impact of the recent flooding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market, especially in TriBeCa, is extremely tight, with the supply of new condominiums after an influx of new downtown buildings sold out. As a result, prices for the remaining available units have been rising, brokers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 93 Worth St., a conversion of a 1924 former garment loft and office building into 92 apartments near Broadway, more than 300 potential buyers signed up to see the project before the launch of a sales office in the next few days. Because of the strong early demand, asking prices were raised nearly 10% in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market is crazy right now," said Shaun Osher, the founder of CORE, a brokerage company that is marketing the 93 Worth St. apartments. The building lost power in the poststorm blackout but wasn't flooded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas Elliott, executive vice president for sales and marketing at El Ad US Holding Inc., the developers of 250 West St., said that buyers wanted a look at the last condos in the building, despite Sandy. More than 80% of the apartments are now in contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is surprising that in the face of all this, there is still interest in TriBeCa in general and our building in particular," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 250 West, one buyer signed a contract for a three-bedroom apartment on the fifth floor for $3.545 million. Another is considering a contract for a two-bedroom apartment at $3.97 million, with six windows looking out at the Hudson River. Both contracts are at the full list price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, brokers say that some would-be buyers in lower-priced condos in the Financial District have pulled back since Sandy, or have been looking to renegotiate prices. In luxury riverfront buildings that remain closed, like Superior Ink on West 12th Street overlooking the river, brokers withdrew some listings after the building was shut down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brett Miles, a broker at Town Residential, said demand was still "astonishing" at Superior Ink. He pulled down a listing for one-bedroom condo priced at $3.2 million after the storm hit, only to have brokers continue to call asking to see it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A buyer in contract to buy another two-bedroom apartment he listed in the building at nearly $4.4 million is going ahead with the deal, he said. Meanwhile, brokers representing other prospective buyers have been calling to check with him just in case the deal falls through, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the W Downtown Hotel and Residences, just across the street from the World Trade Center, buyers are back, too. During the storm, the lobby of the W Downtown was filled with two feet of water, and the building was closed for about 10 days, according to Richard Nassimi, a broker at <span class="companylink">Corcoran Group</span>, who is overseeing sales there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But once the building reopened and crews began rebuilding the lobby, buyers signed contracts for eight condominiums, he said. A string of closings are scheduled for December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People started to feel better because the building bounced back from an act of God," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 250 West St., 88 of 106 condominiums are in contract, and the building was due to start closing before the end of the year until Sandy hit. Though the basement flooded, the lobby located above street level was undamaged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Elliott said that all the equipment in the basement -- pumps, boilers and electrical panels -- were being refurbished for temporary use. But they would then replace the basement mechanicals with new equipment, so that it would be covered by warranties from manufacturers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said closings will be delayed until the first quarter but he expected all deals in contract to close. El Ad is studying how to add a backup generator as well, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 93 Worth St., the developer, IGI USA, part of a global real-estate company based in Israel, is adding four stories of boxlike glass-walled penthouses with terraces on top of the 14-story brick-and-stone building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building includes a mix of studios beginning at under $600,000 to a penthouse with a 2,000-square-foot private terrace with Empire State Building views listed at $6.75 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartments have 7-foot-high picture windows, exposed steel columns to give them a loft-like feel, wide oak-plank floors, and brass and bronzed fixtures throughout.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Neil Shah  </div><div>567 words</div><div>30 November 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. economy grew more than previously estimated in the third quarter, yet remained hobbled by sluggish domestic demand and weaker exports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy expanded at a 2.7% annualized rate last quarter, stronger than the government's initial 2% estimate and the 1.3% notched in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said Thursday. One bright spot was housing, which has helped the economy grow for the past six quarters. In a separate report, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said demand for previously owned homes hit the highest level in 2 1/2 years in October, the latest sign the housing market is mending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the government's latest read on gross domestic product -- the broadest measure of all goods and services produced -- suggests the recovery remains troubled. Much of the nation's growth came from businesses accumulating inventory and a sharp climb in defense spending, which most economists say is unlikely to continue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other pillars of the economic recovery weakened. Consumer spending was less robust than previously thought, rising only 1.4%, compared with an earlier estimate of 2% and 1.5% in the second quarter. Spending on equipment and software, a key gauge of business investment, fell 2.7% -- the first drop since the recession -- suggesting companies are bracing for slower growth and worried about U.S. tax and spending policies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While trade contributed slightly to overall growth, exports grew only 1.1% between July and September, down from 5.3% in the previous three months, the slowest pace since the second quarter of 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Despite the illusion of robust growth in the third quarter, it looks like activity is expanding in the second half of the year at about the same pace as in the first half," said Stephen Stanley, an economist at <span class="companylink">Pierpont Securities</span>. In the first three quarters of 2012, the economy has averaged a 2% growth rate -- not enough to make a big dent in the 7.9% unemployment rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The GDP reading comes as <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> officials near a Dec. 11-12 meeting in which they are expected to vote to continue bond-buying programs meant to spur faster growth. In a speech Thursday, Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley said unemployment remains "unacceptably high," and "while job growth has picked up some recently, its pace has been insufficient to materially change the labor picture."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's report doesn't augur well for the final three months of the year, economists said. The upward revision to the nation's growth rate was driven by businesses' inventory accumulation, which contributed 0.8 percentage point to the overall 2.7% growth rate. Rising inventories can suggest businesses expect higher demand. But with spending flagging, companies more likely are stockpiling unsold goods. That means they will produce less this quarter, crimping growth. There are "risks" of a big "inventory correction," <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> economists said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last quarter's growth also was fueled by a surge in defense spending, a volatile category that jumped 12.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Superstorm Sandy likely knocked a few tenths of a percentage point off the growth rate in the fourth quarter, economists say. <span class="companylink">Pierpont Securities</span>' Mr. Stanley now expects fourth-quarter growth to come in below 1%. <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> sees 0.6%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a divorce, there's one person who is almost as important as the lawyers: the real-estate appraiser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past few years, as property values have risen and fallen dramatically, the tricky business of determining the value of a house—always more of an art than a science—has become even more of a high-stakes gamble. And it's never more complicated than in divorce, where the home is often one of the biggest assets being divided.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There always are competing and dueling interests about what to do with property," says Michael Vargas, co-founder of Vanderbilt Appraisal Co. in New York's tri-state area. "Ultimately, no one wants to lose."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Real Housewives of Orange County" star Vicki Gunvalson and her ex-husband, Donn, for example, spent nearly two years hashing out who got their 5,400-square-foot Coto de Caza, Calif., home (her) and their Lake Havasu vacation home and boat (him). While viewers knew of the divorce, Ms. Gunvalson says she and Mr. Gunvalson didn't hash out the details of it on television. Mr. Gunvalson declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate appraisers across the country say up to a third of their business comes from divorce cases, with some reporting a recent uptick. Jonathan Miller, head of Miller Samuel Real Estate Appraisers &amp; Consultants, says his Manhattan firm's divorce case load has increased by 20% in the past couple of years. Stephen Matonis, an appraiser in Orlando and Palm Beach, Fla., says he charges $4,000 for a divorce appraisal instead of his typical $1,000 fee because it takes more time and effort when litigation is involved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This type of work really isn't coveted among appraisers," Mr. Matonis says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Divorce attorneys usually try to agree on a neutral appraiser for both parties, but in hotly contested cases, each party may hire his or her own appraiser. Appraisers say two professional valuations typically should be within 10% of each other, but when the owners have competing interests, the variations can be significant. Raymond Rafool, a divorce attorney in Miami, says he had a case several years ago in which two appraisers' values were $2 million apart. In some cases, a third appraiser would be brought in to settle the vastly differing appraisals; in Mr. Rafool's case, the court disregarded both appraisals and ordered the home to be sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If I make both parties unhappy, I probably have a good number for the property," says Sara Schwarzentraub, an appraiser in La Mesa, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some appraisals also involve retrospective valuing if, say, the husband owned the home prior to the marriage but the couple put $3 million into remodeling together; in that case, the appraiser has to estimate the value of the house both at the time of marriage and at the time of the divorce, and the court may decide that the wife is entitled to part of the home's appreciation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This brings up the renovation effect. Paradoxically, a number of couples who end up dividing up their property have just finished a major home upgrade. Mr. Miller, the New York appraiser, pulled data over the past three years and found that approximately 67% of properties his firm valued at $3 million or more for divorce matters were in the process of or had recently completed a gut renovation. He says some couples seem to use a major remodel as "a way to place a Band-Aid on a larger problem."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, divorce attorneys, therapists and real-estate brokers say renovations bring differences between couples to a head, and by the time the remodel is completed, some couples decide to call it quits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's what happened to professional wrestler John Cena and his ex-wife, Elizabeth Cena, says Mr. Rafool, who is Ms. Cena's attorney. The couple had just completed a two-year renovation on their Tampa, Fla., home when Mr. Cena filed for divorce in May. There was a prenuptial agreement in place, and Ms. Cena didn't keep the home or have the chance to enjoy the new look that she had created, says Mr. Rafool. Both Mr. and Ms. Cena declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Postrenovation, new furnishings can provide another wrinkle. David Aronson, an attorney in Manhattan, says he represented a doctor who had just finished a gut renovation of his new Park Avenue apartment when he and his wife decided to separate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of the makeover, the couple had spent $650,000 on custom chairs, tables, matching drapes and upholstered couches. "Nobody's tush had ever sat on those chairs," Mr. Aronson says. When the appraisal for the furniture came in at $56,000—furniture often loses much of its value once it's taken off the showroom floor—the lawyers drew up a plan for the wife to pay the doctor one-third of the purchase price; in turn, she kept the furniture in the remodeled apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers are all too aware of how tricky it is to sell a home in a divorce. There is always the worry that people may try to place a lowball offer or negotiate harder if they know the current owners are itching to get rid of it. That's why Jeff Hyland, president of Beverly Hills, Calif., brokerage Hilton &amp; Hyland, says he and many other agents will stage specific parts of the home where it would be noticeable if, say, the man has moved out. In the bathroom, Mr. Hyland will display cologne and aftershave on the vanity and hang dress shirts and ties in the closet. "You don't want people to ask what's going on here," Mr. Hyland says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Linda Bollea filed for divorce from Terry Bollea (who's better known as pro wrestler Hulk Hogan) in November 2007, the couple decided to sell their two homes. Their beach house in Clearwater, Fla., sold fairly quickly for $1.2 million, and Ms. Bollea received the proceeds of the sale as part of the divorce agreement, which also stated that Mr. Bollea wouldn't pay alimony, says Ms. Bollea. But their 17,000-square-foot primary home in Belleair, Fla., which they built for $9 million, wasn't as easy to sell in an area where the median sale price is $230,000, according to real-estate firm Zillow. The sale, which happened in April for $6.2 million, was the last part of the divorce to be settled and was split 50-50, though much of Mr. Bollea's half went to Ms. Bollea as part of the equitable-distribution agreement, according to her attorney.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what was inside the Belleair home compounded their property battle. When Ms. Bollea moved out of the 17,000-square-foot mansion, she took all the antique furnishings—including a bathtub adorned with hand-carved wood—and removed chandeliers and other light fixtures that cost as much as $50,000. Ms. Bollea says she didn't want to leave "nice stuff" in the home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bollea saw that the light fixtures had been removed and promptly got his lawyers involved, according to Ms. Bollea's attorney. (Mr. Bollea declined to comment, as did his lawyers.) After a round of tussling, she agreed to return all the chandeliers but kept the antique furniture. "I wouldn't do that again," Ms. Bollea says of her light-fixture decision. "But I ended up with a great deal."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nancy Keates </div><div>2352 words</div><div>30 November 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every so often, Grant Risdon looks out his living room window and sees a stranger staring up at him, waving. Mr. Risdon isn't a celebrity -- he is a consultant at a biotechnology company. But his house has a very public persona: Its second floor is almost entirely encased in glass, making it look like a transparent box floating above the more traditional homes in a densely populated Seattle neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Risdon says he wanted to feel connected to the outside but didn't want to leave the city. He says he and his wife don't use blinds -- even at night. "I don't feel exposed. I don't worry about it. We have nothing to hide," Mr. Risdon says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Glass walls and floor-to-ceiling windows have become hallmarks of many modern architects. But typically, high-glass homes are built in rural areas, on properties hedged off from the street, or many stories up in high-rise condominiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now glass is entering its final frontier: street-level homes in urban neighborhoods. Architects say clients want all the benefits of a city -- its energy, diversity and walkability -- without the drawbacks of a traditional street-level city home, which is often starved for light. All that glass makes for great people-watching for the inhabitants. But it also provides great inhabitant-watching for the people outside the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, architects are doing what they can to minimize the fishbowl effect. Some use subtle elevation changes so that it can be hard to see more than a few feet into a room unless the viewer is standing in the middle of the street. The glassiest parts of the home are put on the second floor, where the more-public living spaces are, while the bedrooms are put in back or downstairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advancements in reflective glass are also allowing architects to construct glass walls that maximize the view out and minimize the view in. Architect David Hertz, of the Studio of Environmental Architecture in Venice, Calif., used reflective glass in designing what he calls the Panel House, a three-story, four-bedroom, 3,600-square-foot glass house on a small lot located right up against the boardwalk in Venice, in the heart of a nonstop pedestrian parade. The whole front of the house, which faces the boardwalk and the ocean, lets the owner look out but is like a mirror to people outside. ("In Venice, people flex in front of the glass and do their makeup," says Mr. Hertz.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's about not being disconnected from the outside world -- knowing what the weather's like without having to open a window," Mr. Hertz says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even when the windows are opened, the glass acts as a privacy barrier. On the first level, a special gear system opens the window by lowering it into a slot below -- but the glass doesn't go down all the way. It stops at 3 feet, just enough to make it hard to see inside. The sides of the house are made from the same material as refrigerator panels, helping to counteract the heat generated by all the sunlight entering the home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The owner of the Panel House, Thomas Ennis, an inventor of carwash equipment, says he wanted a full view of the ocean with no obstructions. He likes the openness of the house, which took about three years to build and cost about $1.6 million: "It makes me feel like I'm on a yacht in St. Tropez at the dock where people are walking by."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, two years after he moved in, Mr. Ennis has made some adjustments, including adding several large planter boxes in front of the windows to stop passersby from randomly yelling up at him. Now, if he sees tourists outside taking photos (his house is listed as a sight-to-see in several travel guides), he can choose to speak with them or not. He plans to put in blinds that open from the bottom instead of drapes, allowing him privacy at night but still letting air in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Chicago, physician Pravin Patel and his wife, Mojgan Laghaei-Patel, loved the light and views they had when they lived on the 42nd floor of a high rise with floor-to-ceiling glass windows. After they had their kids -- now 10 and 13 -- they moved to a single-family house, which was very dark, in the Lincoln Park neighborhood. The couple didn't want to decamp to the suburbs -- they liked the city's diversity and its proximity to work. So when another house next door went on sale, they decided to buy it and tear it down to build a five-bedroom house with an all-glass front on three of its four stories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the lot was so narrow -- 24 feet wide by 119 feet deep -- and pushed up against other houses, the only way to get a lot of light was to open up both ends with lots of glass, says architect John McCarthy of Osterhaus McCarthy, the firm that designed the house. A skylight in the middle and an open stairwell let even more light inside. Completed in 2011, the house has a two-story living room and dining room that faces the street with an all-glass front, which allows passersby to see in. Their daughter's room is also all glass in front, but the desk was placed by the window, with the sleeping area put in back. "I don't mind if neighbors see her doing homework," says Ms. Patel, who adds she isn't any more concerned about privacy and security than she would be in any other house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In order to keep such a modern, glassy house from sticking out too much, the architects used materials and colors for the first-floor brick facade that mimic the neighboring houses. Big trees in front of the house act as natural heaters and coolers, with the leaves blocking the sun in the summer and the bare branches letting it in during the winter. The "backyards" are landscaped terraces, one of which is on the flat roof, next to an all-glass top floor that has views of the city but is too high for anyone to see in. That's where Mr. Patel reads and Ms. Patel grows the seeds for her garden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some believe that more glass means exposure to jeopardy. Julie Rochman, president and CEO of the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety, a Tampa, Fla.-based nonprofit supported by the property-insurance industry, says large uncovered windows could be viewed as creating a greater risk for burglary, theft and vandalism, while windows without shutters or extra thick glass could be viewed as a greater risk for natural hazards like heavy winds or fires. While different insurance companies evaluate homes differently, in general "unprotected large potential openings are not going to be looked upon favorably," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Glass houses aren't new. Two of this country's most famous examples -- Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's see-through Farnsworth House in Plano, Ill., and Philip Johnson's Glass House in New Canaan, Conn. -- date back to the middle of the last century. But some architects aren't as comfortable with the idea in cities. Daniel Piechota, a partner of the San Francisco-based firm Sagan Piechota, says he uses glass all the time in less-crowded neighborhoods but not downtown in cities. He argues that glass is tricky enough when there's lots of space, with issues including birds, flying tree limbs and the generation of additional light pollution, which can mar the nighttime scenery. In cities, a glass house "doesn't seem appropriate," says Mr. Piechota. "The people inside become a show."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others say it's part of the city experience to see and be seen. "If you're going to live in an urban area you might as well embrace it," says architect Kevin Angstadt of QB3 Studio in Philadelphia. His firm designed a roughly 3,000-square-foot, four-story glass house in downtown Philadelphia that boasts an all-glass three-story entry, living and dining area. On the second floor, the dining room almost looks like a 9-foot-high stage for the audience in the street. There's so much glass on so many levels that inside occupants can see through to the exterior of the house and back through to the interior of the house's other rooms. On the top floor is the glass-box master bedroom surrounded by a terrace, which sports a sunken wood hot tub, a grill and lawn chairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Angstadt says that with the exception of the dining room, the view into the home was slightly fragmented by putting the windows at different angles in different parts of the house, and by pushing the glass inward at the corner. "When you are in the living room you might see a pair of legs walk by or a head float by," he says. The house cost about $350 a square foot to build.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, Barry Alan Yoakum moved into his 2,600-square-foot, two-bedroom house, which has a white brick base and an elevated glass box angled toward the Mississippi River, in a dense urban neighborhood in Memphis, Tenn. Shortly afterward, he found himself the subject of interest of a teenager with a telescope across the street. (Mr. Yoakum spoke with the parents to get the kid to stop.) Then he noticed tour buses, en route to somewhere else, would frequently stop in front of his house, discharging camera-wielding occupants who wanted to photograph his unusual house. The crews of the tugboats and barges that float by along the river often peer into his bedroom with binoculars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it isn't just humans he needs to watch out for: Mr. Yoakum had only started to get used to the birds hitting his windows when one day there was a noise that sounded like a rocket. It turned out to have been a full-grown hawk that slammed against the glass, leaving feathers. He found the large bird stunned outside and watched it fly away five minutes later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Yoakum, a partner at architectural firm Archimania, says he usually sleeps with all his drapes open. "I have friends who drive 2 1/2 hours away to a lake house on weekends," he says. He is five minutes from work and can walk to restaurants, movies, and grocery stores -- and can still gaze out from bed to see flocks of birds swooping up the river and the moon tracing its way across the sky. And he doesn't worry about security because when the alarm system goes on, so do all the lights, making it very easy to see a thief from anywhere in or out of the house. "People are so used to living in caves with punched holes," he says. "That doesn't feel good to me."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yoakum used what's called "smart glass," which is coated with a material that blocks heat and keeps out ultraviolet rays. Some have double or triple panes, gas between them for maintaining heat and coatings that can keep dirt and water spots from ruining the views. For Mr. Yoakum's house, which cost about $400,000 to build, the window packages cost $53,000; Mr. Yoakum estimates that it would have been about $40,000 if he'd used regular glass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other architects prefer to stick with clear glass for houses, saying such "smart glass" interferes with the quality of the natural light, distorting the view to the outside, and tends to cost too much. Chris Pardo, founder of Elemental Architecture, who designed Mr. Risdon's Seattle home, used standard windows but with thin supports between them to give a "storefront" look.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Getting the houses past neighborhood design review boards is growing easier, architects say. Mr. McCarthy's firm had extensive opposition when he built similar looking glass houses in Chicago in 2007, but found mostly enthusiasm when the plans for the Patels' house came up for review a few years later in a different Chicago neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yoakum built his house in a planned community dedicated to mimicking architectural styles of the past -- like Charleston, S.C., sideyard houses and simple shotgun cottages -- yet he had no trouble getting his home approved. He even passed off the all-glass box attached to the house as a "bay window." "I couldn't do hundreds of years ago. It's not today," explains Mr. Yoakum.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even before Sandy ripped through the Northeast coast last month, the region's housing market had been among the weakest in the nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, damage from the storm is raising new concerns in coastal communities about falling home prices and more foreclosures as weary homeowners—some upside down on their mortgages or still reeling from last year's Tropical Storm Irene—decide whether to stay or go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problems are especially evident in New Jersey, which has been largely left out of the housing recovery that has taken hold in much of the rest of the nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Jersey home values declined 1.8% in September from a year earlier, according to real-estate data firm <span class="companylink">CoreLogic Inc</span>. Only Rhode Island and Illinois posted bigger declines. Nationally, prices were up by 5%, with 43 states seeing year-over-year gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, nearly one in six New Jersey homeowners with a mortgage is upside down, or owes more than their properties are worth. And the state has the second-highest foreclosure rate in the country—after Florida—with some 12.7% of loans that were three months past due or in foreclosure as of September, up from 11.9% one year ago, according to the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>. Nationally, the share of seriously delinquent loans fell to 7%, from 7.9% one year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fallout from Sandy could make a bad situation even worse. "Anybody who was about to buy a house and needed to get a mortgage, that is stopped in its tracks," said Dana Miller, a real-estate agent with <span class="companylink">Weichert Realtors</span> in Rumson, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While New Jersey avoided the worst excesses of the subprime bubble that plagued Florida and the Southwest, home prices in the state nevertheless rose by around one-third between 2002 and 2006, according to <span class="companylink">Zillow Inc</span>. Today, New Jersey's housing market is more troubled than most states in part because of a large backlog of unresolved bad mortgage debt. The state is one of several that requires banks to process foreclosures in court, and the banks have struggled to satisfy legal procedures, leaving more homes vacant or in limbo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosure delays have stretched the amount of time it takes for banks to complete foreclosures in New Jersey to 960 days, compared with 676 days for the nation as a whole, according to <span class="companylink">Lender Processing Services Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say that over the past decade, hurricanes have generally prompted a surge in mortgage delinquencies but not necessarily foreclosures because lenders tend to give borrowers time to catch up on payments after natural disasters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Sandy is one of the first major storms to hit a region with so many borrowers who already owe more than their homes are worth. "The foreclosure piece injects a lot of uncertainty into a market that was already dealing with a lot of problems," says Lawrence Friscia, an attorney in Newark, N.J., who represents homeowners facing foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Let's put it this way: a lot of these folks may make the calculus that they don't want to throw good money after bad," he says. If that happens, "the effect on these submarkets can be profound."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That could lead to scenes like one that has played out over the past year along the banks of the Pompton River in Wayne, N.J. Cesar Reynoso left his modest two-bedroom ranch home after flooding from Irene in August 2011 made the home uninhabitable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Reynoso, who bought the home for $224,000 in 2007 and is now in foreclosure, had unsuccessfully tried to sell it last year for $99,000 after tiring of constant flooding. "I told them, 'Listen, I can't do this anymore. This is not livable,' " says the 35-year-old police officer, who moved his family and has been renting. "Everybody on that block is dealing with this problem."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Reynoso says he had an agreement with his lender, <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo &amp; Co</span>., to use insurance payments to fix up the house and then complete what is known as a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, giving the property back to the lender. But he says the bank wouldn't disburse the last insurance payment, leaving repairs unfinished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>, which filed to initiate foreclosure in August, says it has been waiting to receive appropriate receipts from Mr. Reynoso to finish repairs. "We're going to do our best to work with him in a way that is hopefully satisfying to him and allows us to move forward," said a bank spokeswoman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will Kroll and his wife canceled their $211,000 purchase agreement after a three-bedroom ranch-style home in Toms River, N.J., suffered extensive flooding. "We found what we thought was our dream home," says Mr. Kroll, who was set to close two days before Sandy hit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the sellers have insurance, renovations are likely to keep the home off the market for several months. Mr. Kroll, a 30-year-old financial analyst, says he and his wife plan to "unwind from the whole disappointment" and then resume their home search.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, chief economist of the National Association of Realtors, says he expects that cancellations in home sales in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut during November will lead to a small decline in the national home-sales figure that will be reported next month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in shore communities that didn't sustain much damage, real-estate agents say higher flood-insurance costs could tamp down demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, owners like Ms. Miller, the real-estate agent, who had to rip out the flooring and baseboards in her Oceanport, N.J., home, which was flooded, aren't worried about the long-term impact on property values because new owners will ultimately leave homes in better shape than they were before the storm. "The dumpiest houses will be built with new construction," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Marino is going ahead with a $352,500 purchase of a three-bedroom split-level home in Brigantine, N.J., on the shore, even though the home was flooded. He was initially set to close on the vacation-home purchase three weeks ago, but had to wait until repairs to the home's walls, heating systems and flooring have been made.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sellers, who have flood insurance, finished those repairs and the home will be reappraised Friday. Mr. Marino, a 60-year-old professor of anatomy, hopes to close next week. He brushes aside concerns about declining property values. "Brigantine is a gem," he says, "and it's just going to be even better when it's rebuilt."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Conor Dougherty, Nick Timiraos and Neil Shah </div><div>873 words</div><div>28 November 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market, which plunged the economy into recession five years ago and was a persistent drag on the recovery, is now a key economic driver at a time when other sectors are slowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists project U.S. gross-domestic-product growth will slow in the final three months of the year from the sluggish 2% annual rate in the third quarter. Businesses, unnerved by the prospect of federal tax increases and spending cuts known as the "fiscal cliff" taking effect in January, have slowed their pace of investment spending. Military spending also is expected to slow, further weighing on growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while those economic pillars weaken, an improving housing market is buoying consumers' spirits and giving the economy its biggest lift since the real-estate boom. <span class="companylink">Macroeconomic Advisers</span> projects the economy will grow at a 1.4% annual rate in the fourth quarter, with housing contributing 0.4 percentage point. IHS Global Insight is projecting a 1% growth rate, with housing contributing 0.53 of a percentage point -- the largest contribution since 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Housing seems unfazed by the uncertainty that is plaguing other parts of the economy," said Ben Herzon, an economist with <span class="companylink">Macroeconomic Advisers</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real-estate recovery is just beginning, of course, and housing's role in the overall economy remains diminished by five years of rising foreclosures and falling prices. New loans aren't easy to come by as lenders grapple with distressed mortgages. Millions of homeowners owe more than their property is worth. Still, housing's steady improvement is "going to offset some of the slowdown in manufacturing, and it is one of the reasons we think we're likely not to see a double-dip recession," said Doug Duncan, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices rose 3.6% in September from a year earlier, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller National Index out Tuesday. Prices are up 7% through the first nine months of 2012, which is the strongest rise since 2005 and puts prices on a trajectory to beat even the most optimistic forecasts from earlier this year. The gains also are broad-based, with 18 of the 20 cities tracked by the Case-Shiller index -- except Chicago and New York -- showing year-to-year gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing turnaround has been a boon for real-estate brokers and home builders, some of whom have seen their stock prices more than double this year. Retailers have seen a new stream of customers ready to decorate, furnish and upgrade their homes, while investors are spending at hardware stores to renovate previously foreclosed homes. Banks have posted record mortgage profits amid high refinance volumes and stronger demand for new loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond those direct benefits are a number of indirect effects. Rising home values make homeowners feel better about their finances -- making them more likely to spend and, with interest rates low, more comfortable about taking on debt. An index of confidence released Tuesday by the Conference Board rose to 73.7 in November, the highest level since February 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Housing's share belies its importance to the economy," said Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>. "The confidence effects are massive."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising home prices are making consumers feel flush, which may eventually spur them to spend more: New home-equity lines of credit are projected to grow by 22% this year to $77 billion, a three-year high, according to <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising home values have given Clara Soh confidence about her finances -- and she is spending accordingly. The 35-year-old senior director at a pharmaceuticals trade group has spent the past five years saving more and spending less. With interest rates low, she recently refinanced a Portland, Ore., home that she has been renting out since her recent move to Washington, D.C. That lowered her payment by $300 a month -- while the home has gained $100,000 in value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, she plans to pay off her 30-year mortgage early and splurge a little: She recently spent $300 on clothes, $1,000 on climbing gear, and $700 on a new bike. "I feel a little more confident about the direction things are going. I have a little more of a cushion," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While rising prices now are driving the housing market forward, that couldn't have happened without a painful cycle of losses. Lower prices and rock-bottom interest rates have boosted affordability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising rents and an uptick in household formation have ignited demand, which, in turn, has pushed inventories of homes for sale to their lowest level in at least a decade. The upshot: More buyers are chasing fewer homes, pushing up prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Consumers are trying to find a house to buy and they can't," said Ivy Zelman, chief executive of research firm Zelman &amp; Associates. In Phoenix, <span class="companylink">Maracay Homes</span> sold out four of its 12 developments this year and will add 10 new ones over the next six months.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Craig Karmin </div><div>747 words</div><div>28 November 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C10</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Chinese company listed on the New York Stock Exchange is beginning to develop residential property in the U.S., hoping to tap into the hot demand among Chinese investors for U.S. apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Xinyuan Real Estate Co</span>. purchased a site last month in Williamsburg, in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, for its first development in the U.S., a 216-unit condominium building. The company also is scouting for other U.S. projects, planning to sell about 40% of the units it builds to Chinese investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese developers of apartment buildings have an edge over U.S. developers when it comes to reaching potential buyers in China, said Omer Ozden, an adviser to Xinyuan and other Chinese investors in the market for U.S. real estate. "If right out of the gate you can get 40% the building sold to mainland Chinese, it's going to be a successful project."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese investment hasn't poured into U.S. real estate as some experts predicted, but it has been steadily growing. Two dozen Chinese real-estate companies, both state-owned and private, are also scouring major U.S. cities for property deals, Mr. Ozden said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the firms are primarily seeking residential developments, though some are looking to acquire commercial buildings or luxury hotels, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one closely watched deal that is being negotiated, <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>., a major home builder, is in talks with the <span class="companylink">China Development Bank</span> for about $1.7 billion in capital to transform two former San Francisco naval bases into huge housing developments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, as the Chinese government has tried to deflate a local housing bubble by restricting property purchases, more Chinese capital has flowed to the U.S. A report from the National Association of Realtors said that Chinese buyers accounted for $9 billion in U.S. residential sales for the year ended in March, trailing only Canadians among foreign buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ozden, who is also a partner at <span class="companylink">Beijing Capital</span>, the private-equity arm of the Beijing municipal government, said that Xinyuan is focusing on cities where Chinese investors like to live, primarily New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Miami. These buyers typically use the condos as investments that they intend to rent out. Some plan them as second homes, or places for their children to live while studying at a U.S. university.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Xinyuan paid $54.2 million for the site in Williamsburg and plans to spend about $200 million on the development. Total condo sales are expected to be in the $250 million to $350 million range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finding the right project hasn't always been easy for Chinese investors. Mr. Ozden said cultural differences have often made teaming up with U.S. partners a challenge. Some Chinese developers have relied on close friends, who speak English but know little about real estate, to serve as their negotiators. That has limited Chinese access to deals, and they often see properties only after many local investors have taken a pass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign investors have stubbed their toe in U.S. real-estate before. New York City can be particularly challenging for outsiders unfamiliar with how contractors and unions operate. Mr. Ozden said Xinyuan is hiring locals in New York to help navigate areas like that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Xinyuan, which was founded in Zhengzhou in 1997, is developing residential buildings in about eight Chinese cities. It was the first real-estate developer in China to list shares on the NYSE, when it had an initial public offering in 2007, according to the company website. This month, it reported third-quarter revenue of $226.1 million and net income of $31.9 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company acquired the Williamsburg site from New York real-estate investor Richard Kalikow, who had foreclosed on the project's developer. Xinyuan plans to build mostly three-bedroom units to appeal to families who want an upscale building but may be priced out of Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ozden declined to comment on how much Xinyuan intends to charge for the units, but condos in the area tend to sell for around $700 to $800 a square foot. "We think Williamsburg has one of the biggest upsides for residential real estate in the U.S.," Mr. Ozden said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Yaffi Spodek </div><div>803 words</div><div>26 November 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A22</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Thrillist Media Agency, a men's lifestyle online publisher, was one of the thousands of Manhattan businesses that had to figure out how to keep operating after superstorm Sandy cut power to Lower Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It didn't take long. Within a day, Thrillist employees were working out of a so-called "prebuilt" office facility that had been developed at 245 Park Ave. by the <span class="companylink">Regus Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It had Wifi, phones, printers and desks. "They even had hot coffee for us, which is a big deal when you're coming to work from a powerless apartment," says Jody Rones, vice president of advertising sales at Thrillist, which returned to its offices at 568 Broadway after power was restored.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scramble among Manhattan companies to find temporary space in Sandy's aftermath provided a surge of business for prebuilt office facilities, a growing niche market in the city's commercial real-estate business. The availability of those facilities cushioned Sandy's blow for many displaced businesses, enabling them to reduce their losses from the storm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typically tenants lease raw space and then build out the interiors and add furniture and fixtures to their specifications, often with a financial contribution from landlords. In the case of prebuilt space, landlords or companies like <span class="companylink">Regus</span> lease and outfit big blocks of space. They then rent it out to numerous businesses that may need just a desk or a suite of offices from a few days to several years. A private two-person office with a receptionist, phone and Wifi can cost $1,500 per month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts estimate that there is now close to 4 million square feet of prebuilt space in the city, close to the equivalent of two Empire State Buildings. Indeed, Sandy struck at a time when prebuilt space was beginning to play a more important role in an otherwise weak office leasing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Owners are responding to the demand in the marketplace for smaller space where tenants can come in and don't have to go through complexity and time and expense of building out their own space. It's filling a niche in marketplace," says Bill Rudin, president of Rudin Management Co., which has done over 120,000 square feet of prebuilts in the last few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Regus</span>, one of the largest providers of such space nationwide, has increased its number of facilities in Manhattan to 26 from one in 2001. "We have seen tremendous growth over the last three years," says Guillermo Rotman, chief executive of <span class="companylink">Regus Group</span> Americas. "In today's economy, this space has become more profitable and more efficient."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rotman says in the weeks following Sandy, it closed deals with 82 different companies and found temporary work spaces for about 800 people. <span class="companylink">Regus</span> also opened up special disaster relief centers with temporary workstations for displaced tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traditional leasing activity has slowed down this year because of contractions by the financial services businesses and overall concern about the health of the economy. Numerous landlords have responded by getting more into the prebuilt space business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Given that leasing velocity this year is not at last year's levels, we have become more creative in our portfolio and in determining what level of prebuilt installations we offer to set ourselves apart from our competitors," says Paul Amrich, vice chairman at CBRE.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doug Linde, president of Boston Properties, said in a conference call with analysts in October that "the best chance to be successful at achieving rents well in excess of $100 a square foot" at the company's buildings at 510 and 540 Madison Avenue has been with a prebuilt suite program. "The velocity has been frustrating, but we continue to move forward. We continue to seek tenants each and every day and we are convinced that the building will lease up at the rents we have pro-formaed and that there is demand for those small tenants."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As demand for prebuilt space has increased, so has developer creativity in designing the space. <span class="companylink">Regus</span> plans to open a new facility in 747 Third Ave. that includes a street-level lounge. Customers who pay as little as $30 a month can have access to it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, at 444 Madison Ave., CBRE decided to enhance the level of prebuilt finish by offering different ceiling treatment in open areas, resulting in a cleaner sheet-rocked loft look with pendulum lighting. And landlord Herald Square Properties has fixed up its prebuilt space at 292 Madison Ave. to appeal to technology and new media tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The look is "edgy, bright, cool, and efficient," says William Cohen, executive vice president at <span class="companylink">Newmark Knight Frank</span>, the broker for the building.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Rachel Louise Ensign   </div><div>927 words</div><div>24 November 2012</div><div>23:32</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Sunday</div><div>SNJR</div><div>WSJ1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This New Year's, you may want to make a resolution to go house hunting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are finally starting to recover, but they're still low enough to get a great deal. Add to that interest rates that are at historic lows, and 2013 may be the time for first-time home buyers to finally get in the game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We think the answer, definitively, is that home prices have bottomed," says Stan Humphries, chief economist of real-estate firm Zillow. "Right now, buying looks very attractive, even for short-term time horizons."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the timing may be right, the tougher standards lenders imposed after the housing crash are still very much in place. So buyers with good credit and a hefty down payment may benefit the most.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Now it's all about the rules," says Jeff Conn, a mortgage banker in the Atlanta area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Window of Opportunity</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bevy of data suggest housing prices have finally begun to climb back. So there's a window of opportunity before prices start a faster upward march.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of an existing single-family home was $178,700 in October, up 11% from a year earlier, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. But that's still down 13% from $204,800 in October 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers can find particularly good deals in the Phoenix area, where home values are rising steadily, but are still more than 40% below the peak, says Mr. Humphries. Home values have also started rebounding from their bottoms in the Dallas, Miami and Denver metropolitan areas, but are still below their peaks—meaning there are potential deals to be had, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices are on the way up, but mortgage rates remain in the bargain bin. The average rate on a standard 30-year fixed-rate mortgage hit a record low 3.46% for the week ended Nov. 16, according to data provider HSH.com. The average rate on a standard 15-year, fixed-rate mortgage hit a low of 2.84%. And rates are expected to stay low next year and further out, thanks, in part, to the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s moves to keep interest rates low until mid-2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For first-time home buyers, it may be easier to buy. Many first-time buyers are opting for loans backed by the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span>, since they now have looser credit and down-payment criteria compared with the tougher criteria for standard loans. The typical rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage backed by the FHA was 3.31% last week, according to HSH.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the FHA is now facing billions of dollars of losses on loans originated between 2007 and 2009. To help bolster its finances, the agency recently announced a series of measures including higher annual insurance premiums and a change to rules that allowed insurance premiums to lapse. Typical borrowers have to pay an up-front insurance premium of 1.75% of the loan amount and, starting in 2013, a higher annual premium of 1.35% of the balance, up from 1.25%, says Keith Gumbinger, vice president at HSH.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many potential buyers have sat out of the market and rented instead—because they were waiting for prices to bottom out, found it to be a cheaper option or couldn't qualify for a mortgage. But the jump in renters after the housing collapse led to higher rents throughout much of the country. In many cases, it no longer makes financial sense to rent instead of buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In about three out of four U.S. housing markets, it now takes less than three years of owning a home with a standard 30-year mortgage for buying to be cheaper than renting a similar space, says Zillow's Mr. Humphries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tougher Standards</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While home prices are trying to inch back to pre-crash levels, lenders are not returning to the lax lending standards of the boom market, when loans with no down payments were not rare, says Mike Fratantoni, vice president of research at the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's still back to basics. That means "good credit, a down payment, and document, document, document," says Matt Vernon, head of home loans sales at <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>. "Credit [was] always available, but it's different. Not different than it was a decade ago, but different than it was five years ago."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowers will typically need a FICO credit score of at least 740, and a minimum 20% down payment to qualify for the best rates on a standard mortgage, says Mr. Gumbinger. FHA-backed loans require a minimum 3.5% down payment and lenders often require a minimum FICO score of 620, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And be prepared to break out the paperwork—lots of it. You'll typically need to have one or two years of tax returns, as well as pay stubs from an employer, which some lenders didn't ask for before the crash. Also expect to provide statements from your bank and brokerage accounts, says Mr. Vernon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's got to be a clear paper trail," says Mr. Conn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, some mortgage pre-approvals are expiring faster, in some cases lasting only 30 days, compared with 60 to 90 days before the bust, says Mr. Gumbinger. After that, you'll need to show the lender updated financials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We tell people to never leave any stone unturned," he says.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Lana Bortolot </div><div>1091 words</div><div>20 November 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A20</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As owners and developers of office towers wait to see how New York City's proposed rezoning for the Grand Central Terminal area will play out, preservationists are sounding the alarm for buildings they fear may meet a wrecking ball.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If approved next year, the new zoning could permit the construction of taller towers to replace buildings in Midtown East that the city planning office says are outdated and unable to meet demands of top tenants. Of the some 400 buildings in the proposed redrawn area, more than 300 are at least 50 years old, according to the planning office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Preservationists say the rezoning could compromise Midtown's skyline and visual design and destroy its historic fabric. Some of the area buildings have landmark protection but many others do not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're not saying don't do this; we're saying you don't upgrade an area by taking out its architectural language," said Peg Breen, president of the New York Landmarks Conservancy. "There's plenty of room for great new gigantic buildings that are not destroying the architectural heritage of the city, and these soft sites are some of our best buildings." Soft site are those identified for potential redevelopment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Breen's group has identified 15 buildings constructed between 1911 and the late 1920s around Grand Central Terminal -- including the unified streetscape along Vanderbilt Avenue, site of the Yale Club -- that could be imperiled under the new zoning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Built in a variety of styles from Neo-Classical and Beaux Arts to Art Deco, many were constructed around Terminal City, a cohesive complex above and around Grand Central once anchored by the Roosevelt, Commodore and Biltmore hotels. Only the Roosevelt remains intact; the others have been long-covered by modern skins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area slated for rezoning includes parts of Madison, Park and Lexington avenues and unprotected buildings such as the 45-story Art Deco office tower at 295 Madison Ave., and historic hotels such as the 1924 Shelton Towers Hotel at 525 Lexington Ave.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the proposed rezoning, if qualifying site owners were to purchase development rights for Class A towers -- prestigious, state-of-the-art buildings that can charge premium rents -- that could merit the expensive teardown of a building, no matter its pedigree. Many of the present buildings fall into Class B, which are considered appropriate for a wider range of tenants, with good finishes, adequate systems and lower rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saving the buildings isn't a sentimental journey, notes Ms. Breen, who said many were built by the "starchitects of the day." One such site: the Postum Building at 250 Park Ave., built by Cross &amp; Cross in 1925, the same firm that built <span class="companylink">Tiffany &amp; Co</span>. and the landmark General Electric Building a few blocks away at 570 Lexington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owned by <span class="companylink">AEW Capital Management</span>, the 88-year-old Postum is one of the few survivors of Terminal City and, adjacent to the Helmsley Building, creates a dignified gateway to Grand Central. The 21-story building has within the past year attracted a number of European clients who appreciate the aesthetic of an older site and yet want a Park Avenue address, said Dan Bradley, AEW's portfolio manager for the Postum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are more of B-ish building in a A-ish location, but we understand we have a really unique building and we offer a great value," he said. "We're definitely studying the proposed language [of the rezoning proposal] to best understand the details and the potential impact not just for our site but the bigger Grand Central market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some building managers such as Anthony Malkin straddle the unusual line of historic-site ownership and pro-development, looking for opportunistic ways to repurpose old sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Malkin, whose company owns the Empire State Building and One Grand Central Place, a 55-story prewar tower 60 E. 42nd St., said that though he is an advocate for older buildings, he supports the city plan because he and his family "are huge believers in transit-oriented development."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I fully support the argument that just because something is old doesn't mean it's not useful, but you can't look at every building and say they all should be fairly considered repurposable," he said. "The most beautiful thing about One Grand Central is our lobby, but it is very limited as to the tenant who will rent in it because of the floor plate."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Community Board 5, which oversees the area, also has compiled a list of historic buildings for study. Raju Mann, an urban planner who serves on the board's transportation and land-use committee, said it was an "open question" if the old buildings were unsuitable for Class A use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The city has not supplied us with sufficient argument that these buildings can't support that kind of use," he said. "Many neighborhoods have a history of keeping the stock but retrofitting for new-generation use."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokeswoman for the city landmark commission said the agency is "currently reviewing historic resources in the area to determine which may be eligible for landmark designation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fred Cerullo, president and chief executive of the Grand Central Partnership, the area's business improvement district, said all stakeholders will have a say in the process, which he sees as an opportunity for Midtown to regain its global footing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My understanding of the real genesis of this isn't merely to create new office space in Midtown, but to create better office space and at the same time mix those opportunities with the historic and icon buildings," he said. "We see it as being complementary, not contradictory, to the neighborhood we have," he said of the rezoning plan</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cerullo serves on the city planning commission and said he would recuse himself from voting on the rezoning item when it comes up for review.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Simeon Bankoff, executive director of Historic Districts Council, a preservation advocacy organization that has also identified buildings of interest, thinks several midcentury modernist buildings along Park Avenue, such as the Colgate-Palmolive Building at 300 Park Ave., ought to be among those preserved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These are examples of modern design, the brand-new world we were all marching into," Mr. Bankoff said. "This was the natural habitat of the man in the gray flannel suit, which captures a moment of enthusiasm in New York that really isn't captured anywhere else."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos </div><div>832 words</div><div>20 November 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes were stronger than expected in October, putting them on track to hit their highest annual level since 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.79 million units in October, the second-highest level of the year and up 2.1% from September, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Monday. October's level represented a 10.9% gain from a year earlier and was the 16th consecutive month of year-over-year home-sales gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices are rising amid sharp declines in the number of homes listed for sale. Just 2.14 million homes were for sale at the end of October, down 22% from one year ago to the lowest level in a decade, according to NAR estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With more buyers chasing dwindling inventories of homes -- and, in particular, fewer foreclosed properties that sell at steeper discounts -- prices are beginning to rise in more markets. The national median home price rose by 11.1% from one year ago in October to $178,600, according to the NAR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are clearly in recovery," said John Burns, chief executive of John Burns Real Estate Consulting in Irvine, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At October's sales pace, there were just 5.4 months of supply. That was the lowest level since February 2006, which was before housing markets began their prolonged decline. One-third of homes sold in October had been on the market for less than a month, according to the Realtors' group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to The Wall Street Journal's quarterly survey of housing-market conditions, inventory levels of homes for sale have fallen in all 28 metropolitan areas tracked in the survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the current pace of sales, there was just one month of supply in Sacramento, Calif., where inventory fell by 56% from one year ago. The months' supply stood at 2.4 in Phoenix, 2.8 in California's Orange County, 3.2 in San Diego and San Francisco, and 3.6 in Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing demand began gaining pace a year ago as prices in many hard-hit markets had fallen so far that investors began scooping up homes at substantial discounts. Rising rents have encouraged many such investors to rent out the houses, rather than putting them on the market and trying to flip them for a profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently, demand among traditional buyers has jumped amid continued declines in interest rates that have made homes, based on monthly mortgage payments, more affordable than at any time in at least 15 years. The <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span> said loan applications for home purchases rose 22% in the first week of November from one year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median home prices have now risen for eight consecutive months, which last occurred in early 2006, just before the housing bubble burst. In part, that reflects an increase in sales of more-expensive homes. Sales of homes priced below $100,000 fell by 0.6% from one year ago in October, while sales of homes priced between $750,000 and $1 million rose by 53%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Craig Moll, of Clearwater, Fla., said his biggest hurdle in buying a home was that there "weren't many to choose from." Mr. Moll sold a townhouse in 2009, as the housing market deteriorated. "Over the course of about a month, the entire opposite side of the street turned into rentals as the market started to crash," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, with mortgage rates at historic lows and home prices "creeping back up, it felt like our time to buy something," he said. This summer, he paid $340,000 with a 10% down payment for a four-bedroom home with a swimming pool in Clearwater. "It wasn't a great deal. It was a good deal," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, housing markets face headwinds, including stringent mortgage-lending standards. Mr. Moll, who is self-employed and advises insurance companies on weather-related car damages, said getting approved for a mortgage was "very, very difficult."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors' group also warned that November's home sales could drop due to Sandy, the superstorm that battered the Atlantic coast from southern New Jersey to New York's Long Island and Connecticut, at the end of October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some buyers already have pulled out of sales agreements while other homes that were under contract must be re-inspected or repaired before banks will finance loans. Compared with September, home sales fell by 1.7% on a seasonally adjusted basis in the Northeast; that contrasts with gains of 4.4% in the West, 2.1% in the South and 1.8% in the Midwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another wildcard: Whether Congress avoids the "fiscal cliff," a series of tax increases and spending cuts set to kick in at year-end, which some real-estate agents worry could undercut consumer confidence, potentially deferring some sales.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hopes that lawmakers in Washington will reach an agreement on taxes and spending gave investors new confidence and drove stock indexes to their best day in two months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors have spent a tense few weeks since the election watching for smoke signals out of the nation's capital for indications that Democrats and Republicans are nearing a compromise. On Monday, they found reason for optimism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Barack Obama said he was "confident" an accord could be reached, and congressional leaders have said they are making progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New data Monday also showed existing home sales climbed last month and builder confidence rose to the highest level in 6 1/2 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For investors, the stakes are high. If no deal comes to pass by the year-end deadline, a raft of tax hikes and spending cuts would automatically come into effect, potentially dragging the U.S. economy into recession. As big a worry: the wrangling until then could send markets on a wild ride.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Until we get much closer to a deal, we're going to see more volatility in the markets," said Russ Koesterich, chief investment strategist at <span class="companylink">BlackRock Inc</span>. "We're going to be hostage to these utterances out of D.C."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After four straight losing weeks, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 207.65 points, or 1.65%, to 12795.96, its biggest gain in two months. The Nasdaq Composite rose 2.2%, driven by a 7.2% surge in <span class="companylink">Apple Inc</span>. Asian markets rose early Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors and analysts cautioned the gains could quickly be erased should progress in Washington stall, or if new weakness emerges in Europe. Late Monday, Moody's Investors Service stripped France of its triple-A rating, citing its weak economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As a money manager, you don't know where the bottom of the market is, but I don't want to miss the boat if the market goes higher from here," said Reed Choate, a portfolio manager at Neville, Rodie &amp; Shaw, a New York firm with $1.2 billion under management.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Willard Spiegelman </div><div>1241 words</div><div>20 November 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D5</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dallas -- This city loves business; this city loves art. The two enterprises often work in sync. And, as Dallas comes out of a recession, the cranes have returned to the landscape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But on one front the news is not happy. Former friends no longer speak to one another. Collision has replaced cooperation and threatens civic harmony. The Nasher Sculpture Center, which opened in 2003, is a jewel in the crown of Dallas's downtown arts district. It is now embroiled in a fight with the owners and builders of Museum Tower, a $200 million, 42-story, luxury high-rise condominium, scheduled for completion and occupancy in December. Dallas has always suffered from a lack of downtown residential offerings. So why should this handsome building be considered a threat? Can beauty be evil? Is David confronting Goliath?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a complicated Dickensian story involving land rights, real-estate transactions, gentlemen's agreements, accusations of bad faith, egos and, most of all, light, heat and shadows. The end is nowhere in sight, and each party is casting aspersions and blame on the other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Raymond and Patsy Nasher amassed, over a 50-year period, a great collection of 20th-century sculpture. Wooed by suitors from all over, Mr. Nasher finally decided in 1997 to leave his collection in the city where he made his real-estate fortune. He commissioned a subdued, tranquil museum by Renzo Piano, which houses and rotates pieces from the collection both inside its perfectly lighted bays and outside in an elegant garden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the street, an unimproved parcel of land, purchased by local developers, might have become an extension of the Nasher, but in 2005 the Dallas Police and Fire Pension System stepped in as an investor in a possible residential project. Several architectural plans were submitted and rejected; a nonbinding covenant (which ended in 2008) declared that any building would not exceed 22 stories, and would use glass of no more than 15% reflectivity in order to protect the grounds and interior spaces of the museum. Mr. Piano's ingenious roof for the Nasher involves a series of north-facing oculi, little egg-shell apertures that admit diffused light into the building and cast a soft glow throughout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2007 the pension fund trustees approved a new design for the much larger tower. That same year, Mr. Nasher died at age 85 (Mrs. Nasher had died in 1988). Then came the financial meltdown of 2008, halting construction and sales. The economy edged slowly back, and in 2010 ground-breaking took place for the new tower. A year later, Sculpture Center officials saw reflections bouncing off the tower's glaring glass exterior into the museum. They also closed down a James Turrell sky-viewing room at the end of the garden because the tower had begun to overwhelm its opening to the sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the beginning of this year, they also claim to have noticed that the grass and trees in their garden were being burned by the tower's massive windows. (A 2010 agreement called for material of no more than 35% reflectivity.) According to Jeremy Strick, the Nasher's director, the reflectivity of the glass in Museum Tower is 44%. Things are heating up, indoors and out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year both parties met to begin working toward some sort of solution. Negotiations soon turned sour; squabbles ensued. The tower people wanted the museum to modify its roof. The museum replied by saying, essentially, "we were here first." Tom Luce, a local lawyer and civic leader, agreed to act as a mediator. Late last month he stepped aside in frustration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only 15 of the 126 apartments (priced at $1.3 million to $4.5 million, not including the $20 million penthouse) have sold. Some potential local buyers may have been scared away because they don't want to suffer criticism that they are helping to damage the very arts district that appealed to them in the first place. A spokesman for the tower claims that once it is occupied the building will generate $9 million annually in tax revenues for the city of Dallas. But no one knows when that may happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any solution will be costly and difficult. The Nasher people have recommended louvers covering the tower's south face. The tower people say that this will require a computer-generated engine for every window, about two years to study, even more time to install. And it may not work. They say they worry about "structural load" and the effect of winds on the 1,000 panes of glass facing the museum. The Nasher says that the louvers are both unobtrusive and eminently workable; they have been used in Germany to good effect. Wind presents no danger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tower people have brought forth two experimental solutions. The first is a form of nanotechnology that will coat and harden all the windows with a carbon-based spray. The Nasher officials call it "pixie dust."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second is a bizarre plan for an almost 400-foot construction-- part sculpture, part machine-- by the architect Joshua Prince-Ramus, to stand between the two buildings and to diffuse the light. It looks like a multidimensional arch that would open and close as needed in order to control glare. The tower people consider this a bold statement that will add to the panache of the arts district. The Nasher people say no: It will be wildly expensive ($20 million to $30 million), and it will overwhelm, as well as overshadow, their delicate museum, what Mr. Piano refers to as "my little gallery." Goliath threatens David once more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tower people also say the least expensive solution will be for the museum to redirect the Piano roof apparatus so that light from the high-rise does not enter the galleries. Museum officials say that this plan, in addition to insulting Mr. Piano, will lower the inside illumination by 50% and do nothing to mitigate the effects of light and heat on the gardens. To which the tower people reply that damage to the garden at the Nasher has been minimal, that the Kentucky bluegrass carpeting the lawn is ecologically inappropriate for the Texas climate, and that the trees look just fine. Each side has hired its own consultants to evaluate the damage to the landscape; not surprisingly, they have come up with differing conclusions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Strick says that "the creation of the Nasher Sculpture Center, making it a home for the Nasher collection, is the single largest philanthropic gift in the history of Dallas, a legacy that exceeds a billion dollars." He insists gently: "We are determined to preserve it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the tower is finished, the owners of the immense penthouse will have a 360-degree view of Dallas, the prairie beyond, and also of a still largely un-residential downtown that includes work by seven Pritzker Award-winning architects: Santiago Calatrava, Norman Foster, Philip Johnson, Rem Koolhass, Thom Mayne, I.M. Pei and Mr. Piano. What they won't see is the very building that has caused such local consternation: their own. Whether Museum Tower will ultimately be considered a work of beauty, a symbol of aggressive capitalism, a white elephant or some combination, remains to be known.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home building rose in October to its highest rate in more than four years, the latest sign that the once-troubled housing market is improving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts increased 3.6% last month from September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 894,000, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. Compared with a year earlier, new home construction was up 41.9%. It is at its highest rate since July 2008, before the depths of the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said superstorm Sandy had a "minimal" effect on the data because the storm hit only a small part of the country and at the end of the month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of single-family homes, which made up two-thirds of housing starts last month, dropped 0.2% in October to a rate of 594,000 units. Single-family construction was up 35.3% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures were above expectations. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast overall housing starts would drop to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 833,000, which would have been a 4.5% decline from September's previously reported figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starts in September were revised down to a rate of 863,000, reflecting a 15.1% increase from August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers are the latest indication the housing market is getting back on track.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes grew 2.1% in October, marking the 16th consecutive month of year-over-year increases, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending on home construction and home improvements has contributed to economic growth in six straight quarters, the Commerce Department said last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report Monday showed U.S. home builders are more optimistic. A reading of their confidence rose for the seventh consecutive month in November to reach its highest level in more than six years, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> said. The report also said they are seeing a jump in prospective buyers at a level not seen since April 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While this year's housing starts are up from a low of 478,000 in April 2009, they are still below the historical average. Builders have started construction on about 1.5 million new homes per year since 1959.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said homes that are razed because of Sandy but will be rebuilt on the existing foundation will count as new housing starts in future data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday's report showed that the number of new building permits, an indication of future construction, fell by 2.7% to an annualized level of 866,000 in October. That was above economists' estimates for a rate of 860,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Commerce data showed new building was up in two of four U.S. regions. Building rose 17.2% in the West and 8.9% in the Midwest, but dropped 6.5% in the Northeast and 2.5% in the South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actual housing starts, which are calculated without seasonal adjustments, inched up slightly to 77,900 from a downwardly revised 77,800 in September. Lumber and commodities markets watch those numbers closely to gauge demand.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the West Side</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just weeks away from breaking ground on the first building in its mega-Hudson Yards development, Related Cos. has lined up financing for a residential project across the street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York state's Public Authority Control Board authorized up to $54 million in tax-exempt bonds for the planned 139-unit tower at 529 W. 29th St. The project is eligible for tax-exempt bonds because Related plans to rent some of the units to low and moderate income tenants at so-called "affordable" rents that don't exceed a percentage of their incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The entire project will cost $85.8 million with the rest of the money coming from low-income tax credits and a $33.7 million equity contribution from Related. A spokeswoman for Related declined to discuss the financing but she said Related plans to open the building sometime in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, Related received approval from Chelsea's Community Board 4 on the company's proposal to transfer more than 100 units of affordable housing from the Manhattan Plaza project at 400 and 484 W. 43rd St., to the new development at 529 W. 29th St., the spokeswoman said. She said the developer is still working to get the necessary government approvals to allow the West 29th Street project to be 100% affordable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The West 29th Street site is less than a block away from another residential tower Related is building with developer Abingdon Properties at 500 W. 30th St. That structure will be a 32-story building with 386 planned units, 77 of which will be affordable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both structures are located at the edge of Related's Hudson Yards project, a 26-acre mixed-use mega development planned for Manhattan's West Side. Related plans to break ground in the next few weeks on the first building in the development, a 46-story office tower that will be anchored by <span class="companylink">Coach Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Laura Nahmias</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stormy Relations</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Relations between many Manhattan landlords and their tenants got testy in the aftermath of Sandy, which displaced occupants of scores of buildings while saddling owners with the monumental chore of getting them back in commission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But relations between the tenants of the apartment building at 90 Washington St. and its owner, developer Joseph Moinian, were particularly strained. Tenants of the 398-unit rental tower bombarded his company, Moinian Group, and online websites with complaints and also organized an 80-person email list to keep one another up-to-date.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of their gripes: a press release that Mr. Moinian put out stating that his company was providing rent credits to its tenants displaced by Sandy and that it was "dedicating all our resources to the speedy return of our tenants."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To many tenants of the rental tower, this added insult to injury partly because Moinian was required by their leases to grant them credits. They also they felt Mr. Moinian's company wasn't doing enough for them and wasn't sensitive to their plight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some renters complained they couldn't get any information about the building's status for days. Natan Edelsburg, 25, and his girlfriend Ali Feinstein, 23, say they were concerned about the security of their belongings but onsite staff initially had no information about whether guards would be posted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carmine Montalto, 47, says November rent was automatically withdrawn from his account, despite the fact that he didn't have access to his apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"How cold can you possibly be," he asked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eric Gerard, spokesman for the Moinian, did the best that it could following "an unprecedented event." He noted that the company established a special hotline for tenants on Nov. 6, as well as a storm-update email address but that "many tenant's questions just could not be answered until the extent of the damage was evaluated." He also said the company hired additional security personnel at the onset of the storm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gerard said that some of the November rent bills were sent out prior to the storm. But he noted that the company was now giving rent credits for December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gerard also pointed out that Mr. Moinian also owns six office buildings and the W New York-Downtown hotel, but the multitude of complaints after the storm came from the residents of 90 Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He declined to comment on the company's decision to put out the press release.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news is that tenants of some of the 90 Washington's floors were able to start returning home Saturday. An email sent to them said that the Moinian Group "would like to offer our sincerest appreciation for the patience our residents have shown during this ordeal."</p>
