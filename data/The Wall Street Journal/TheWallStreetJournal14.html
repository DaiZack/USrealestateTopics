<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sunny skies and hula dancers aren't the only things attracting foreigners to Hawaii. Add this to the list: one of the most valuable shopping centers in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mall giant <span class="companylink">General Growth Properties Inc</span>. last week announced it had sold a 25% stake in Honolulu's Ala Moana Center, the world's largest open-air mall, for $1.37 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal is notable for two reasons: its sky-high price and General Growth's partner, <span class="companylink">AustralianSuper</span>, an $84 billion retirement fund making its first major foray into U.S. property investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial real estate typically is valued based on its capitalization rate, or the annual net income produced by a property divided by the purchase price. Like bond yields, falling cap rates indicate rising values, and vice versa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, <span class="companylink">Ala Moana</span>, a 2.2 million square-foot shopping center with 290 shops and 80 restaurants, produced $145 million in net operating income, according to Steve Sakwa, an analyst with Evercore ISI. Based on that, the mall traded at a cap rate of 2.9%, one of the lowest at which a mall has ever sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In comparison, the average mall cap rate in March stood at 5.2%, according to Green Street Advisors, a Newport Beach, Calif., property-research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the end of 2016, after a scheduled expansion is expected to add another 660,000 square feet of space, General Growth expects the mall to be producing about $215 million in net operating income. That would push the cap rate to roughly 3.9%, still extraordinarily low for the mall industry but perhaps not such a red flag.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If it's not the best mall asset in the country, it is definitely one of the top five," Mr. Sakwa said of <span class="companylink">Ala Moana</span>. “I'm not sure there's any other mall in the country that does over $200 million in net operating income a year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General Growth, the country's second-largest mall owner by market value, has been pruning its portfolio since emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy nearly five years ago. In 2010, the company owned all or part of 169 malls. Today it has 121.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real-estate investment trust also has started snapping up pricey urban retail properties, including properties on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan and on Michigan Avenue in Chicago, at top-dollar prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We've really been going through a major portfolio transformation," said Kevin Berry, General Growth's spokesman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General Growth said it plans to use the proceeds from the sale of <span class="companylink">Ala Moana</span> to pay down about $700 million in debt. <span class="companylink">Ala Moana</span> also produces more than 10% of General Growth's annual net operating income, the company said, and selling a stake in it allows the company to reduce some of the risk associated with having such high exposure to one asset.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyer of the stake in the Hawaiian mall, <span class="companylink">AustralianSuper</span>, is one of the largest Australian superannuation funds, which manage large pools of tax-advantaged retirement savings contributed by Australian workers and their employers. The funds are typically invested in a portfolio of equities, fixed-income securities and real assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign buyers often find it easier to buy property assets in one-off deals from private sellers because it is easier to reach a deal quietly, with less competition than there is for REIT assets, said James Fetgatter, chief executive of the Association of Foreign Investors in Real Estate, a trade group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“A lot of the newer foreigners that have entered the market recently are playing it safe," Mr. Fetgatter said. “They're buying core, stable, trophy assets with lower yields."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, as commercial property prices have risen, the market has seen several high-profile partnerships between foreign institutional investors and REITs. In November, for example, office landlord <span class="companylink">Boston Properties Inc</span>. sold a 45% stake in three towers in New York and Boston to Norway's sovereign-wealth fund for $1.5 billion. General Growth has roughly 30 joint ventures with foreign institutional investors, though not all of them as large as the <span class="companylink">Ala Moana</span> deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the Australian fund, the <span class="companylink">Ala Moana</span> represents a blue-chip real-estate investment, despite its high price tag and a recent decline in the value of the Australian dollar relative to U.S. currency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The yields on U.S. property are better than fixed income and safer than equities," said Mark Delaney, <span class="companylink">AustralianSuper</span>'s deputy chief executive and chief investment officer. <span class="companylink">AustralianSuper</span> is looking to increase its property allocation from about 8.3% to about 10% over the next three to four years, the fund said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The REITs are by and large the main holder of high-quality assets, which are the type of assets we're targeting in the US," Mr. Delaney said. “If you want to get high-quality assets, you have to deal with their owners."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Art Patnaude   </div><div>685 words</div><div>9 March 2015</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2015, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">International investors are piling into U.K. student housing, with a flurry of deals showing renewed interest in this small corner of the property market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greystar Real Estate Partners of the U.S. has agreed to buy a student-housing portfolio for about GBP 600 million ($915 million) from U.K. private-equity group Round Hill Capital LLC, a person familiar with the deal said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the <span class="companylink">Canada Pension Plan Investment Board</span> spent GBP 1.1 billion to acquire the U.K.'s Liberty Living, while a company headed by Russian oligarch Mikhail Fridman paid GBP 532 million for another London student-housing portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yields on office buildings and other traditional property types have fallen as investors flush with cash and able to borrow at low rates have pushed prices higher. That has some investors looking elsewhere for higher returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traditionally, real-estate investing "has been focused around the main commercial property types of retail, office, and industrial," a February report from the Investment Property Forum, a U.K. industry body, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But investors' hunt for higher long-term returns is producing "significant changes in the market," said Jon Neale, head of U.K. research at broker JLL. The fastest-growing sectors are now those deemed "alternatives" -- like student-housing, hotels, health care and privately rented residential real estate -- GBP 11.6 billion of which traded in 2014, a 33% increase from 2013, JLL figures show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It remains a small part of the GBP 65 billion of U.K. real estate traded last year, but alternatives "accounted for only a few percentage points of volumes just a few years ago," Mr. Neale said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For U.K. student accommodation, the average investment yield has been 5.8% this year, compared with 5.1% on offices, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span> data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The yield on student housing is down from 6.4% last year, a reflection of rising prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were about $2.4 billion of student housing transactions in the U.K. in 2014, down 18% from 2013, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>. U.S. firms Greystar, LaSalle Investment and <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> have been among the biggest buyers in the last two years, the data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last Friday, the Canadian Pension Plan bought 16,700 student rooms in over 40 residences across 17 cities -- as well as the company that manages the business -- from the Brandeaux Student Accommodation Fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was the Canadian investor's largest-ever real-estate deal in Europe, and its first there in the alternative space, said Andrea Orlandi, head of European real-estate investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For CPP, student accommodation provides "a noticeable pickup in the yield" offered by office investments, Mr. Orlandi said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The opportunity to buy the management company and its team means, "we can look to buy more assets" in a sector "that can, and will, consolidate in the future," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.K. has long been a destination for foreign students looking to study at one of the renowned universities, or simply improve their English. London in particular is a magnet for foreign students.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last Tuesday, <span class="companylink">Carlyle Group</span> sold Pure Student Living -- with 2,170 student rooms across five central London sites -- to a Luxembourg-based investment vehicle called LetterOne Treasury Services, led by Mr. Fridman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal saw Carlyle exit from U.K. student accommodation after a five-year run. But the U.S. investor "remains committed to student housing as a long-term institutional asset class," the firm said in a statement, noting it still has over 1,700 rooms in the Netherlands managed under The Student Hotel brand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Greystar deal Monday, Round Hill is selling three London residences with 2,375 beds, a portfolio it bought for $415 million from <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span> in 2012. Round Hill will retain the student-housing brand Nido, its management business and one student residence in London it bought earlier this year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHANGHAI -- Companies dealing in real estate are combining in China as the property downturn lingers and the emergence of Internet services upends the business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">58.com Inc</span>. -- the Chinese equivalent of <span class="companylink">Craigslist Inc</span>., backed by Internet company <span class="companylink">Tencent Holdings Ltd</span>. -- said Monday that it had acquired Shanghai-based property-listing platform <span class="companylink">Anjuke Inc</span>. for about $267 million in cash and shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It marked the latest deal in China's fast-expanding market for services that connect online users with traditional offline businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another deal, announced on Sunday, Homelink Real Estate Agency Co., Beijing's largest real-estate firm by market share, will combine with Shanghai Deovolente Realty Co. Homelink, which is much larger than Deovolente in terms of employees and outlets, characterized the deal as a merger but didn't disclose terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2011, real-estate companies have weathered a volatile market and the rise of China's e-commerce companies. Conditions have worsened since 2013 because of a huge supply of homes, especially in smaller cities. Housing sales in China fell 7.8% nationwide in 2014, and home prices in many smaller cities declined significantly, squeezing profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February, average home prices in 100 Chinese cities fell 3.8% from a year earlier, the fifth straight month of year-over-year declines, according to private sector data provider China Real Estate Index System, an arm of <span class="companylink">SouFun Holdings Ltd</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, more than a dozen property companies, including Deovolente and Homelink, announced a boycott of China's largest real estate Internet portal, SouFun, arguing that it charged unfair prices for listings on its website. SouFun disputes the accusations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, Chinese real-estate firm Century 21 China Real Estate was delisted by the <span class="companylink">New York Stock Exchange</span> after it failed to maintain the required market capitalization. The company has said the delisting won't deter it from increasing its business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">58.com</span> said revenue growth from the housing sector slowed in the third quarter as a result of the housing slump. Some real-estate firms have cut back on the number of branches and on online marketing expenses, said Zhou Hao, <span class="companylink">58.com</span>'s chief financial officer, according a transcript of a company conference call.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Anjuke</span>, which was founded in 2007, sees 66 million unique visitors to its site each month, according to its website. <span class="companylink">Anjuke</span> covers 67 cities in China and said it would continue to operate its website and mobile application under the <span class="companylink">Anjuke</span> brand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deovolente, the Shanghai brokerage, said that after its combination with Homelink, the combined company would be called New Homelink. The combined firm will focus on developing its online-to-offline marketing strategies, Deovolente said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homelink will combine its 1,800 storefront outlets and 35,000 staff with Deovolente's more than 200 storefronts and 5,000 staff, it said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—A forward-looking gauge of U.S. home purchases rose in January to its highest level in nearly a year and a half, a sign of firming demand in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Friday that its pending home sales index[http://www.realtor.org/news-releases/2015/02/pending-home-sales-rise-in-january-to-highest-level-in-18-months], which is based on contract signings for purchases of existing homes, increased 1.7% to a seasonally adjusted level of 104.2 in January from an upwardly revised reading of 102.5 in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected pending home sales would rise 2% last month after dipping in December. Home sales typically close within a couple months after signing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Through the volatility, the trend in home sales is up probably up modestly at least," High Frequency Economics chief U.S. economist Jim O'Sullivan said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index rose 8.4% in January from a year earlier and reached its highest level since August 2013, when home sales were tumbling after a jump in mortgage rates[http://blogs.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/economics/2014/05/19/higher-mortgage-rates-dragged-down-u-s-home-sales-san-francisco-fed/].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist, said sales look healthier despite tight inventory that is sending prices higher, a trend that could deter some would-be home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“All indications point to modest sales gains as we head into the spring buying season," Mr. Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">News Corp</span>, owner of The Wall Street Journal, also owns <span class="companylink">Move Inc</span>., which operates a website and mobile products for the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market entered 2015 on uncertain footing after a generally lackluster 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes, which make up about 90% of the U.S. market, fell roughly 3% in 2014 from the prior year. In January, existing-home sales declined 4.9%[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-down-4-9-in-january-1424703698] from the prior month to their slowest pace since last spring, the NAR said Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of newly built single-family homes ticked down 0.2% in January[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-new-home-sales-at-481-000-pace-in-january-1424876627] from the prior month but remained near their fastest pace since mid-2008, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. In 2014, new-home sales rose about 2% from the prior year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-building activity dipped in January. Housing starts fell a seasonally adjusted 2%[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-housing-starts-slip-2-in-january-1424266345] from the prior month, and single-family housing starts declined 6.7% from December, according to Commerce Department data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, starts rose 18.7% in January from a year earlier, reflecting a 16.3% increase in construction of single-family homes and even stronger growth for multifamily structures like apartment buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates remain low but have ticked up in recent weeks. The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 3.80%[http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/index.html?], <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> said Thursday, up from 3.67% last month but down from 4.30% in February 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Friday's report, pending sales of existing homes rose 3.2% in the South last month from December, and climbed 2.2% in the West. Pending sales ticked up 0.1% in the Northeast and fell 0.7% in the Midwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> on Friday also released seasonal-adjustment revisions for pending home sales data from 2012 through 2014, and revised data for the West region going back to 2001. “Most revisions are minor with no impact on previous characterizations of the overall market based on the headline seasonally adjusted index," the trade group said in a statement.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-Home Sales Falter</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Beginning of Year</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales fell slightly in January but the overall pace remained near a six-year high, a sign of strong demand that could help boost the U.S. housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of newly built, single-family homes decreased 0.2% from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 481,000, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. Figures for the prior month were revised up to a rate of 482,000 from an initial estimate of 481,000, making December the strongest month since June 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's data showed inventories of new homes held fairly steady. At January's pace, it would take 5.4 months to exhaust the supply. The median price of a newly built home stood at $294,300 in January, up 9.1% from $269,800 a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span> said in a report Wednesday that the rate of borrowers falling behind on their home loans or in foreclosure dropped to the lowest levels since 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last three months of 2014, 5.7% of borrowers were at least one payment behind on their mortgage, but not in foreclosure, the MBA said. The percentage of loans in some stage of the foreclosure process in the fourth quarter was 2.3%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">State Senate Passes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Union-Limiting Bill</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wisconsin Senate passed legislation late Wednesday to limit union powers amid a second day of protests here as the state capitol again becomes a battleground over the future of organized labor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The GOP-controlled <span class="companylink">Senate</span> passed a "right-to-work" bill with a 17-15 vote that would allow employees in unionized private-sector workplaces to opt out of paying union dues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Republicans also control the state Assembly, making passage likely in the coming days. Gov. Scott Walker -- who is considering a 2016 run for the Republican presidential nomination-- has said he would sign such a measure into law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Immediately after passage the spectator gallery erupted in boos and chants of "shame, shame!"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bill comes four years after Mr. Walker pushed through legislation limiting the reach of public-sector unions, drawing tens of thousands to protest in the capitol and launching a contentious recall election, which the governor won.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sen. Scott Fitzgerald, the majority leader, said the bill would create a more competitive state economy and give workers more individual freedom to choose union membership. He added that the measure doesn't ban collective bargaining between unions and employers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The legislation still faces opposition from unions and Democratic lawmakers, who argue it is meant to undermine organized labor and won't deliver the economic benefits backers promise. "It's bad for the working men and women of this state, both union and non-union," said Sen. Dave Hansen, a Democrat.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It isn't a great time to be in the business of selling homes. But fixing them up? That is a different story.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department on Wednesday said that builders in January sold 481,000 new, single-family homes at a seasonally adjusted annual rate. That was near the highest level since 2008, but still well below the levels of the 1990s and early 2000s. This came on top of disappointing January existing-home sales figures from the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast, the home-improvement industry is doing well: Witness strong results this week from <span class="companylink">Lowe's Cos</span>. and <span class="companylink">Home Depot Inc</span>. This reflects a broader trend. Commerce Department data show that in real terms, people are spending as much on home and garden tools and supplies as they were in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home improvement's strength amid continued weakness in home sales represents a break in the trend that existed up until a few years ago, when they were more closely related. A simple linear regression analysis shows that if the same relationship seen in the period between 2002 and 2010 held, the real home improvement sales figure in December would have been associated with combined sales of 7 million new and existing homes, at an annual rate. That is about 1.4 million higher than what was actually recorded. Rather than buy their dream home, people are trying to make the home they already own look more like it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Italian family that controls <span class="companylink">Cushman &amp; Wakefield Inc</span>., one of the world's largest real-estate services firms, is putting the company up for sale as rising property prices push up the value of rivals, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Exor SpA</span>, the investment arm of the Agnelli family, has approved management's hiring of <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> to help look for a buyer for Cushman, the people said. Exor prefers a privately held buyer and wouldn't consider selling to a direct competitor, the people said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial real-estate analysts say Cushman &amp; Wakefield could fetch as much as $2 billion. The family paid $565.4 million for a 67.5% stake in Cushman eight years ago and has since boosted that to 81%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When real-estate markets heat up, values can rise for a broad swath of companies that don't own property but profit from transactions and other services. Commercial real-estate services firms have branched out from their traditional roles as brokers to provide a wide range of consulting, appraisal, asset and property management and other functions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cushman is the third-largest property-services firm in the world, after Los Angeles-based <span class="companylink">CBRE Group Inc</span>., and JLL of Chicago, analysts say. Cushman recorded $163 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, in 12 months that ended September 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sharp increase in mergers and acquisitions among real-estate services businesses over the past few years has helped send prices for such firms to more than 10 times Ebitda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a written statement Tuesday, a spokeswoman for Cushman said the firm and Exor "continually seek ways to further enhance the businesses, create value and further accelerate" their plans. She added: "There is currently no transaction to disclose, nor guarantee that such a review may result in any transaction."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sale at such a multiple would be a vindication for the Agnelli family, best known for their control of <span class="companylink">Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV</span>. The family took control of Cushman in late 2006, just before the market crashed. During the early years of the downturn, Cushman suffered losses and management upheaval as the pace of real-estate sales and leases slowed to a crawl.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But commercial real estate has rebounded strongly in the current low-interest-rate environment. Investors are paying record prices for office buildings, stores, hotels and other properties, believing their returns will beat bonds and be less volatile than stocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales surge in turn has boosted brokerage commissions for real-estate services firms, which has attracted investors to the sector. Shares of publicly listed CBRE on Tuesday were near their 2007 peak, while JLL was just below its record high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, big investment firms have been looking to acquire services firms. Last year, a venture led by private-equities giant TPG paid $1.05 billion for Chicago-based DTZ and merged it with <span class="companylink">Cassidy Turley</span>, a Washington firm valued at up to $600 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">BGC Partners Inc</span>., a <span class="companylink">Cantor Fitzgerald</span> spinoff, has been investing heavily to grow services firm <span class="companylink">Newmark Grubb Knight Frank</span>. Earlier this month, Toronto-based <span class="companylink">FirstService Corp</span>. announced plans to spin off its commercial-real-estate unit, <span class="companylink">Colliers International</span>, as a separate publicly traded company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cushman, which will celebrate its 100th birthday in two years, has benefited from the market's recovery and more stable management in the past year following a period of tension with Exor executives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Agnellis' experience with Cushman dates to the mid-1980s, when the family that co-founded <span class="companylink">Fiat</span> acquired a minority stake in <span class="companylink">Rockefeller Group Inc</span>., which owned Cushman. Rockefeller Group later was purchased by <span class="companylink">Mitsubishi Estate Co</span>., but in 2006 the Agnellis acquired a 67.5% stake in Cushman from <span class="companylink">Mitsubishi</span>. Firm employees hold the 19% of Cushman not owned by the Agnellis</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crash of 2008 hit the company hard. Cushman posted a $127 million loss in 2009 and was hurt by the departure of a number of top-performing brokers. In 2010, it brought in a turnaround expert Glenn Rufrano as chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rufrano improved the firm's performance but clashed with Exor's chief operating officer, Shahriar Tadjbakhsh, a former <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> executive who played a lead role in overseeing the real-estate firm. Mr. Rufrano abruptly left in 2013 before his contract ended following a dispute over his desire to reinvest Cushman's profits rather than pay them to Exor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A flurry of management changes followed. Former <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>executive Edward Forst took over as chief executive. Mr. Tadjbakhsh left Exor and John Elkann, Exor's chairman and the great, great grandson of <span class="companylink">Fiat</span>'s co-founder, became chairman of Cushman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Messrs. Forst and Elkann agreed on strategy. In December, the Exor board approved Mr. Forst's three-year strategic plan to spend more than $500 million on technology and acquisitions of firms and talent in top cities, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cushman quickly moved ahead on that strategy by acquiring Massey Knakal Realty Services, a leading New York brokerage, for $100 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The effort to find a new owner for Cushman will be overseen by Mr. Forst, who is supportive of the sale because he is hopeful a buyer would fuel the firm's expansion more rapidly, according to people familiar with the matter. At this point he and Exor executives aren't interested in becoming a public company because they believe Cushman can be more competitive in private hands.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Alessia Pirolo and Kjetil Malkenes Hovland   </div><div>917 words</div><div>25 February 2015</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2015, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Norway's state-run investment fund is becoming one of the world's biggest landlords at a time when other big commercial-property owners are sounding alarms about high prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $874 billion Government Pension Fund of Norway, the world's largest sovereign-wealth fund, last year purchased $7.6 billion of property globally, more than any other sovereign fund, according to data from real-estate tracker <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The push is part of a broader strategy to improve returns by taking on more risk. The fund, which has generated an annual return of 3.7% since 1998, aims over time to boost its real-estate holdings to 5% from the current 1.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, the fund closed on its purchase of a 45% stake in a 40-story skyscraper at 11 Times Square in Manhattan for $401.9 million, a deal that valued the 1.1 million square foot property at $1,273 a square foot, which is at the high end of the range of prices being paid for Midtown office buildings in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, meanwhile, the fund beat six other bidders in London for Queensberry House, a 75,000-square-foot retail and office building, agreeing to pay GBP 190.6 million ($294.6 million.) The seller, <span class="companylink">Sorgente Group SpA</span>, had paid GBP 167 million for the property in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some experts question the timing of the Norway fund's strategy of bulking up on office buildings, stores, warehouses and other commercial property in Europe and the U.S. Prices have risen so rapidly in the past two years that seasoned investors have begun to move to the sidelines even as Norway piles in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Asset prices today are high, and acquisitions are getting dicey," said Steven Roth, chief executive of Vornado Realty Trust, a leading U.S. real-estate investment trust, on an investor call earlier this month. "We are now at the point in the cycle where the easy money has been made, and it seems to me that this is a better time to harvest than to invest."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a sign of how high values have risen in London, office-building investors in December paid prices that will give them an initial yield of just 4% from the incomes of the properties, according to data from <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was the lowest level since 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Norway fund is the main vehicle through which the Norwegian people benefit from the country's position as the world's third-largest gas exporter and the 10th-largest oil exporter. Its assets have more than doubled since 2010, and its current value is equal to about $170,000 per Norwegian citizen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fund, which launched in 1990 and received its first cash transfers in 1996, initially invested only in stocks and bonds. But average annual returns have fallen short of the government's long-term return target of 4%. Hoping to boost returns, the government in 2010 allowed the fund to invest up to 5% of its value in real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Norwegian central-bank governor Oystein Olsen in a speech earlier this month said that with long-term government bond yields near zero, Norway's fund return could drop "perhaps below 3%."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fund also has been hurt by falling global energy prices, which have cut cash transfers from the Norwegian government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokeswoman for Norges Bank Investment Management, which oversees the fund, said it is trying to achieve the "highest possible return with a moderate risk level."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked about the timing of the fund's increased appetite for real estate, she said: "We are a long-term investor" and that the fund's strategy is to focus on large global cities like New York and San Francisco, where "the prospects for solid long-term return are good."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fund has been especially active in the U.S. In 2014, Norway was the second-largest foreign investor in U.S. real estate, after Canada, thanks mainly to acquisitions by its sovereign-wealth fund, according to a report by <span class="companylink">CBRE Group Inc</span>. Norwegian real-estate investments in the U.S. totaled $4.4 billion in 2014, up 120% from 2013, the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet only 1.3% of the fund's portfolio was in real estate as of the third quarter of 2014. That means it will take much more buying to meet the 5% target -- at a time when prices have risen sharply from their recession lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S., values are at record levels, 17% above their precrash high in 2007, according to Green Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fund executives in June said they planned to invest an additional 1% of its value each year in real estate through 2016. Last year, the fund also hired a separate executive group for real estate and plans to add 200 people to its staff of around 400 by 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some real-estate investors question the fund's strategy of paying top-dollar for properties. While annual income for well-leased top-quality properties typically amounts to between 4% and 4.5% of a property's sale price, Norway has made multiple purchases in which the income is below 4%, a low number in the real-estate sector.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small Contractors Boost Bottom Line</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Home Depot Inc</span>. said strong demand from small professional contractors for everything from compressors to roofing helped boost sales in the latest quarter, a sign of strength in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small contractors play a large role in <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>'s business, accounting for 3% of customers and 35% of its sales, according to Chief Financial Officer Carol Tomé. “Their health is a proxy for the housing market," she said. “As housing recovers they have work and are spending more in our stores."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Sycamore Partners</span> has abandoned its attempt to buy women's clothing retailer <span class="companylink">Chico's FAS Inc</span>. after failing to line up financing for the deal on acceptable terms, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wall Street Journal reported two weeks ago that the New York buyout firm was in advanced talks to take Chico's private.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fort Myers, Fla., company had a market capitalization of $2.8 billion based on its closing share price Tuesday of $18.11. Using typical takeover prices, a deal could have valued Chico's at more than $3 billion, making it one the largest private-equity buyouts this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the potential deal recently fell apart for a reason all too familiar to Sycamore, which in January ended buyout talks with <span class="companylink">Express Inc</span>., another clothing retailer that focuses on young adults. Private-equity firms typically fund their deals using some of their own cash but mainly with debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bankers and others say it has become increasingly hard to finance deals for mall-based retailers, which are beset by declining traffic, lackluster sales and increased competition from e-commerce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to its namesake stores, which tend to cater to older women, Chico's has other brands, including White House Black Market, lingerie label Soma, and online and catalog retailer <span class="companylink">Boston Proper</span>. Across its brands, Chico's has over 1,550 stores throughout the U.S. and Canada, according to its website.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Members Join Board in a Compromise</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Juniper Networks Inc</span>. has agreed to add two new independent directors to its board in a compromise with activist investor <span class="companylink">Elliott Management Corp</span>. over board representation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wall Street Journal reported in December that Elliott, which owns a roughly 9% stake in Juniper, had privately recommended to the Sunnyvale, Calif., company a number of new director candidates in an effort to add more industry experience to its 11-person board and help improve Juniper's operations after the company suffered setbacks, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Juniper said Tuesday that it has appointed Jim Dolce, chief executive of mobile security company Lookout, and Rahul Merchant, who runs his own advisory firm, to its board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The appointments are effective March 1. Juniper said it identified the candidates through a search process started last year that also evaluated Elliott's recommendations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elliott, meanwhile, has agreed to support Juniper's board nominees at its annual meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Juniper, one the largest competitors to industry giant <span class="companylink">Cisco Systems Inc</span>., makes routing and switching systems and other equipment used by telecommunications companies and other big network operators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Juniper has struggled with lower-than-expected demand, particularly in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elliott first disclosed its stake in Juniper more than a year ago. Elliott has since convinced the company to cut costs and buy back more stock.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kathleen Madigan   </div><div>470 words</div><div>24 February 2015</div><div>09:21</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in 2014 saw yearly growth slow to the weakest pace in three years, according to a home price report released Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home price index covering the entire nation rose 4.6% in the 12 months ended in December, said the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index report. That is down slightly from 4.7% in November and is the weakest full-year gain since home prices were falling in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Narrower measures of home prices also showed a small acceleration in December but full-year growth still was the lowest since 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home price index covering 10 major U.S. cities increased 4.3% in the year ended in December from a 4.2% rise in November. The 20-city price index was up 4.5%. That is above the 4.3% advance posted in November and equal to the 4.5% expected by economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report said average home prices in the 10 and 20 cities covered are back to levels last seen in autumn 2004, but are still down between 16% and 17% from their peaks set in mid-2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On an unadjusted basis, the 10-city and 20-city gauges increased 0.1% in December over November, while the national index fell 0.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seasonally adjusted, the 10-city index increased 0.8%, the 20-city gauge was up 0.9% and the U.S. index advanced 0.7% in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P/Case-Shiller report covers sale prices of existing homes, which have been weak lately. The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Monday that January resales fell 4.9%[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-down-4-9-in-january-1424703698], but some of the weakness reflected low inventories of homes for sale. Tight supplies would tend to support higher prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The housing recovery is faltering. While prices and sales of existing homes are close to normal, construction and new home sales remain weak," said David M. Blitzer, chairman of the Index Committee at <span class="companylink">S&amp;P</span><span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> Indices. “The softness in housing is despite favorable conditions elsewhere in the economy: strong job growth, a declining unemployment rate, continued low interest rates and positive consumer confidence."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of previously owned homes slowed in January, a reflection of the rising prices and tight supplies that could constrain the housing market this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales fell 4.9% last month from December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.82 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said on Monday, the slowest pace in nine months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weather didn't appear to be a big factor in the report, which showed sales falling across all regions of the country. While New England was buffeted by blizzard conditions, January overall was warm and dry in the contiguous U.S., according to the <span class="companylink">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sale price for a previously owned home, meanwhile, rose 6.2% from a year earlier to $199,600. Year over year, prices have climbed for 35 straight months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"One of the big problems is the supply of homes," Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors, said in a note to clients. "Basically, buyers have limited options as the inventory is hovering near some of the lowest levels we have seen in the last fifteen years."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the current sales pace, it would take about 4.7 months to exhaust the supply of homes on the market, the Realtors association said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of more homes could help ease the situation, but building also has remained subdued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. housing starts fell 2% from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.065 million in January, the Commerce Department said last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starts on single-family units, which exclude apartments and represent almost two-thirds of the market, dropped 6.7% in January from December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I would say that the initial phase of price recovery was good news for the economy but now that prices are easily outpacing people's income and general consumer price inflation, I would say it's less healthy," said Lawrence Yun, the NAR's chief economist. "We need to moderate the price growth, and that can only happen with an increase in inventory."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing has been a missing piece of the recovery, making only a small contribution to overall economic growth last year. Many economists expect sales to accelerate this year amid steady hiring, still-low interest rates and the formation of new households, though the year is off to a bumpy start.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, existing-home sales, which account for about 90% of all purchases in the U.S., fell slightly from 2013 and remain well shy of prerecession levels.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housewarming May Be in Store</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the arctic air blasting the central and eastern U.S., the housing market is likely to show signs of a chill rather than a deep freeze.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">January was warmer than average for the nation as a whole, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association. Don't tell Boston residents, but seven western states, including California, had one of the 10 warmest Januarys on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That could moderate the decline in sales of existing homes expected Monday when the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> releases data for January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists estimate sales falling from a month earlier but up from the prior year, when severe weather caused the housing market to contract sharply. Zillow forecasts a report of a 2.2% decline in January from December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.93 million units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason for the expected decline is that pending home sales, which lead actual purchases by a month or two, fell in December, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. Also, housing starts dropped in January, according to the Commerce Department. Rising home prices as well as the decline in housing inventory in the last few months of 2014 also likely slowed purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the strengthening jobs market is a plus, the overall economy might not be as favorable for sales. The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta</span> last week lowered its forecast for economic growth in the first quarter to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 1.9% from 2.2%. And while rates fell steeply in January, with the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaging 3.67% for the month, this likely won't provide an immediate boost to housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All isn't lost, though: Lower rates likely encouraged home shopping that may lead to higher sales in the spring. And expectations that the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> will raise interest rates later this year could also contribute to a spring thaw, as buyers look to lock in loans before that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another tailwind is likely to be easier lending conditions. The <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>'s credit-availability index showed improvement in January. This appears to be the result of banks responding to changes in the rules around mortgages purchased by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So even if data due Monday reflect a colder market, there is reason to expect a warmer spring.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Feeling handy? Take a look at Clarksville, Tenn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to numbers from Realtor.com, the city offers the country's biggest price break for home buyers willing to put in a little work. The median price for a fixer-upper in Clarksville is $69,900, an almost 70% discount off the $226,000 median price for a home in good condition. (The analysis focused on houses in the 2,000-square-foot to 3,000-square-foot range.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only challenge is finding one. Of the 806 Clarksville homes on the market in December 2014, just three were handyman specials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fixer-uppers are an increasingly popular option for home buyers looking to save a little money in exchange for a bit of elbow grease, says Leslie Piper, a real-estate agent with San Francisco Bay Area real-estate firm Pacific Union.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But where are the best spots for buying such properties? Based on the percentage, as of December 2014, of home listings that included repair-related terms like "fixer," "as-is" and "TLC," the Realtor.com analysis identified both the markets with the most fixer-uppers available and the places where buying one offers the biggest potential price break.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to Clarksville, towns like Omaha, Neb. (53%), Albany, N.Y. (50%), and Greensboro, N.C. (49%), offer significant savings, but, again, supplies are limited -- these towns' stocks of fixer-uppers number 10, 23 and 1, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, buyers will likely find happier hunting, but smaller discounts, in spots like Atlanta (288 listings, 37% discount), Tampa, Fla. (223 listings, 32% discount) and Philadelphia (348 listings, 17% discount).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then there are locales where buying a house in need of TLC will scarcely score any savings at all. In Portland, Ore., the median fixer-upper runs $354,928, just 6% lower than the $379,000 median price of a home in good condition. In Prescott, Ariz., the discount is a mere 2%. Lorinda Johnson, an associate broker at Prescott Realty, attributes this small spread to what she says is the town's stable, retiree-heavy homeowner base.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regardless of where they settle, buyers considering a fixer-upper should make sure to get estimates from qualified tradespeople to determine just how much they'll have to sink into the property to bring it up to snuff, says Ms. Piper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some repairs, she notes, might be more trouble than expected. Issues like a bad roof or dry rot, for instance, "can be more costly than a buyer might recognize" she says, while problems like open subfloors and exposed wiring represent safety hazards that could make it difficult to get a mortgage.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Builders slowed new-home construction last month after a brisk December, pointing to uneven demand in an otherwise slowly recovering housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. housing starts fell 2% in January from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.065 million, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. That reflected a big drop in groundbreakings on single-family units, which exclude apartments and reflect the bulk of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New applications for building permits, a bellwether for construction in coming months, slipped 0.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home construction is choppy, but starts were up almost 19% from a year earlier in January, reflecting gradual progress. Economists believe the market is primed for a pickup as the labor market improves, though significant obstacles remain, including tight credit conditions and lack of savings by consumers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Despite the drop in starts and permits in January, the gradual housing market recovery of the past few years continues," <span class="companylink">PNC Financial Services Group</span> senior economist Gus Faucher said in a note to clients. “The fundamentals for housing demand are improving: job growth has accelerated over the past year, consumer confidence is rising, interest rates remain very low on an historical basis, and it is becoming easier to obtain credit. There is also significant pent-up demand for new homes after a dearth of building in the wake of the Great Recession."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected January housing starts and permits to both reach a rate of 1.07 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-construction figures are volatile and often revised. Wednesday's report showed new-home construction rose 7.1% in December from a month earlier, up from the initially reported 4.4%. But November's figure was revised down sharply, with starts falling 7.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">January's figure may have been affected by adverse weather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The broader trend shows a gradually healing market from the crash. Housing starts were up 18.7% in January from a year earlier while permits were up 8.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conditions are ripe for a stronger housing market. Interest rates are hovering near historic lows, to an average 3.69% for a 30-year fixed mortgage last week[http://www.marketwatch.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/story/mortgage-rates-rise-as-30-year-climbs-to-369-freddie-mac-2015-02-12], according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. Job growth has picked up, with employers expanding payrolls by an average 336,000 over the past three months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a run-up in home prices and tight lending standards are preventing many families from obtaining mortgages. Those who are buying are generally opting for cheaper previously owned homes rather than new ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Demand for housing continues to be positive but restrained against the backdrop of minimal wage growth and lackluster savings," Sterne Agee economist Lindsey Piegza said in a note to clients Tuesday. “While home prices have slowed their rate of annual appreciation, prices are still far outpacing wage growth, making it difficult for many new home buyers to move into the market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts peaked in early 2006, surpassing a rate of 2.27 million during the height of the housing boom. After the crashed, they fell to a rate of below 500,000 in 2009. A long-awaited pickup in home-building would boost the economy by creating construction jobs and generating household spending on items like furniture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall housing demand has been flagging. Sales of previously owned homes-reflecting about 90% of the market-picked up more than 2% in December from a month earlier. But sales in all of 2014 were down from 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders appear to be slightly less confident in the market than earlier this fall. A measure of home-builder confidence slipped to 55 this month from 57 in January[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/home-builder-confidence-dips-in-february-1424185202?KEYWORDS=home builder], the industry's <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> said Tuesday. Still, the above-50 reading indicates most builders remain optimistic about market conditions.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A measure of home-builder confidence dipped in February, a sign that the housing sector may continue to face headwinds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index of builder confidence in the market for new single-family homes, released Tuesday, fell by two points to a seasonally adjusted level of 55 in February from January's reading of 57. A reading over 50 means a majority of builders see conditions as generally positive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-builder sentiment trended up last year before reaching a peak of 59 in September, its highest level since 2005. But that upward movement has faltered over the past few months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the sentiment index has remained above 50 for eight consecutive months. The trade group attributed this month's downturn to unusually high snow levels in parts of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several factors in the economy would appear to support stronger home sales in 2015. Among them:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employers added the most jobs in 2014 than any year since 1999 and continued to hire steadily in January, the Labor Department said. Lower unemployment typically brings more buyers into the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest rates on mortgage loans are near historic lows. The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 3.69% last week, down from an average of 4.3% in February 2014, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Solid job growth, affordable home prices and historically low mortgage rates should help unleash growing pent-up demand and keep the housing market moving forward in the year ahead," said David Crowe, the trade group's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regionally, the three-month moving averages for the index improved this month in the West but slipped in the Northeast, Midwest and South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAHB index is seasonally adjusted, but those adjustments can't always account for shifting weather patterns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We know from last year's experience during the polar vortex, when the headline index fell 10 points, that the NAHB survey is extremely susceptible to severe weather, so we can't right now view it as a reliable indicator of the underlying trend in housing market activity," Ian Shepherdson, chief economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the NAHB index has traditionally tracked closely with single-family housing starts. But in recent years, the sentiment gauge has climbed much faster than the actual construction of homes has increased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, there is hope that the market is revving up after years of malaise. Builders broke ground on single-family homes at the fastest rate in more than six years, with U.S. housing starts up 4.4% in December from a month earlier, the Commerce Department said last month.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They're impossible to escape. The awful, record-setting real-estate numbers jump out of the newspaper, creep into one's <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> feed and infiltrate the diner talk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to various reports, the average sale price in Manhattan rose 19% last year. Condo prices in brownstone Brooklyn climbed 37%. And for the first time, a property has shattered the $100 million mark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're not already a homeowner, you might be thinking your future shelter will consist of a cardboard box.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet, the median sales price citywide for all properties climbed a modest 2.2% in 2014. That means there must be some neighborhoods where prices are—dare one imagine?—falling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I asked StreetEasy, a local subsidiary of real-estate database Zillow, to crunch the numbers. And the results were soothing. Of the 287 neighborhoods showing property sales, 89 saw declines in their median prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even better, a ranking of the bottom 10 includes some intriguing, charming neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take St. George, at the northern tip of Staten Island. Median prices in this eccentric, steeply hilled jumble of Victorians and '60s townhouses were down 30.7% last year, to $237,810. With all the new development coming to the North Shore, this sounds like an opportunity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there is Prospect Lefferts Gardens in Brooklyn, a historic swath of mansions and townhouses just east of Prospect Park. With the median down 19.9% last year, to $425,880, it remains one of the last truly lovely Brooklyn neighborhoods where prices haven't reached soul-crushing levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some neighborhoods on the list were new to me, including Pelham Parkway, a central Bronx community where prices fell 21.6% last year, to $258,675. I took the 5 train uptown for a peek.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You've never seen so much brick in your life. Stretching west from Bronx Park—which includes the Bronx Zoo and New York Botanical Garden—solid six-story Tudor and Art Deco apartment buildings give way to graceful, single-family homes. The quiet, sloping streets meet at pleasing angles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a racially mixed, working-class neighborhood—half the cars lining the blocks seem to be Toyota Corollas. The neighborhood was plastered with fliers for the annual Albanian Valentine dinner. You can shop at the Last Chance Market grocery or the Star Furniture store, which also offers iPhone screen replacement and MoneyGrams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best part: an abundance of front-patio dog statuary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest surprise on the list, though, was Midtown South—the swath below 40th Street. People actually live there?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paying special attention to the blocks between Madison and Fifth avenues, where the area's few apartment buildings are concentrated, I considered the neighborhood through a resident's eyes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One could buy groceries at the halal food cart, load up on wholesale costume jewelry, bump into neighbors at Penn Station or explore a dozen souvenir shops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are also a ton of dry cleaners, bakeries and hardware stores tucked into the side streets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So why did these fine neighborhoods see price drops? I reached out to local real-estate brokers to get the scoop. That's when the trouble started.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most ignored my calls and emails entirely, the way you might shun an annoying child asking too many questions about sex and death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others questioned my entire premise, admonishing me to get my facts straight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bronx broker Musa Balidemaj was typical. “The information you got doesn't make sense. It's ridiculous!" he said when asked about Pelham Parkway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the area had been defined too broadly. He prefers to focus on a small, genteel subsection where prices rose 15%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York, it seems, is a city where all the neighborhoods are above average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Welcome to my world," says Gregory Heym, an economist with brokerage Brown Harris Stevens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He often hears from brokers who don't understand why the numbers in his semiannual reports don't jibe with their experience, especially when he reports that prices are falling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem: The numbers reflect sales prices, not property values, and there is a difference. “When I issue a report and say the average price is up 10%, people assume their apartment is worth 10% more than a year ago, but that's not true," says Mr. Heym.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a neighborhood with a lot of expensive new development, for example, the median price will climb even if older properties in the neighborhood haven't appreciated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median prices are also affected by the types of properties selling, says StreetEasy data scientist Alan Lightfeldt. If a lot of townhouses sell one year and cheaper one-bedrooms the next, the reported median price will fall even if values are climbing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, as anyone following the news can attest, brokers only argue with the numbers when they go down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An exception: Drew Glick, a Brown Harris Stevens broker who has sold a few properties in Midtown South. While the area's low sales volume makes it tricky to spot trends, he says, it is true that the area isn't Manhattan's most desirable community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it attracts international buyers seeking a convenient pied-à-terre, it is seldom considered by locals looking to buy. And for that reason, it offers good deals. “You can get more for your money," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's the rub: While there is a 19.4% discount on Midtown South compared with the prior year, the median price is still a hefty $922,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We'll have to wait for the <span class="companylink">Groupon</span> deal.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Ruth Bloomfield   </div><div>896 words</div><div>13 February 2015</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2015, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Clegg is the head of residential investment at Cluttons estate agents in London. A Mansion article on Friday about the impact of capital-gains taxes on overseas homeowners incorrectly identified him as Martin Clegg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(WSJ Feb. 14, 2015)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the overseas investors who have funneled billions of dollars into London real estate over the past few years, the party may not be over, but it's about to become more subdued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">British government</span> is acting to close a long-standing loophole in its tax code: In April, for the first time, U.K. homeowners from overseas will need to pay capital-gains tax when they sell their property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move means the taxman will collect up to 28% of the profit earned on a property at the point of sale -- the same tax that British home sellers pay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The charge is not retroactive and will only apply to the price differential between an official valuation for the property for April and its eventual sale price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new capital-gains tax comes on the heels of an overall increase in stamp duty introduced last year that has increased buying costs for properties priced at GBP 1 million (about $1.526 million) or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts disagree about the impact the tax changes will have on the city's booming property market. Prices for London property rose 16.3% last year, according to the Land Registry, which monitors British housing prices. In prime central London, where the buying frenzy has traditionally been the fiercest, the rate of growth has slowed since the surges of 2012 and 2013, though prices continue to rise. The prime neighborhoods of Kensington and Chelsea saw growth of 11.5% last year, compared with 12.1% in 2013. The less affluent but more affordable and up-and-coming east London borough of Waltham Forest saw a rise of 25.1% in the same period</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agent Robert Bailey says he fears the new capital gains tax will tarnish the London market in the eyes of international buyers. "One agent I spoke to in Monaco said that they are seeing a boom in foreigners who have been put off buying here because of the changes, going so far as to label Monaco 'London on Sea' thanks to all the defectors," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oliver Griffiths, of estate agents <span class="companylink">Jackson-Stops &amp; Staff</span>, is based in the affluent neighborhood of Richmond, west London. "The changes will throw cold water on the increasing London market because prime central London has historically been snapped up by international buyers and that has consequently pushed prices through the roof," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I have someone on my books from Saudi Arabia, who bought a GBP 2.25 million [$3.43 million] house on the river in Richmond and has rented it for years. She has had a five-year contract in place, but now wants to pay the contract out and sell up prior to April to avoid the new 28% tax."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However buying agent Edward Heaton, of Heaton and Partners, said he had only seen a "modest" increase in the number of international owners looking to sell and move on in order to avoid the new tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The reality is that London remains an attractive destination and the cost of buying and selling are just something that people live with," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ed Tryon, director of Lichfields, a property-search agency, agrees that the allure of London outweighs the new tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are no barriers to property ownership in the U.K., and no significant annual charges. There isn't a residency requirement as there is in several countries," he said. "The U.K. is one of the easiest countries to acquire property, and long-term growth has outperformed almost every other major asset class."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Estate agent Simon Armitage, of the London property firm Druce, covers the high-end neighborhoods of South Kensington and Chelsea. He believes the tax will only seriously impact the market below GBP 2 million ($3 million). "Those buying over this price are generally sufficiently financially comfortable to not have to worry about the extra tax," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who are not able to simply overlook tax increases will begin looking at entirely new areas of the city, suspects Martin Clegg, head of residential investment at Cluttons estate agents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These territories are mainly on the fringes of prime London -- areas like Earls Court, just west of Knightsbridge and in the throes of a major regeneration; Ladbroke Grove, north of fashionable Notting Hill; and Rotherhithe in east London, which has the added benefit of being close to the city's modern financial district at <span class="companylink">Canary Wharf</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Ruddock, associate director of Marsh &amp; Parsons estate agents in Marylebone, central London, estimates that 70% of properties in the area are currently sold to overseas buyers. He doesn't think they will stay away but believes the increased costs might change the way they shop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"International buyers still consider London to have lower entry and exit costs than other European cities, though I suspect that they may look to buy more, cheaper units rather than one-off, big-ticket properties," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott Rechler bet big on Manhattan commercial property in 2009, jumping into the market at the depths of the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After watching prices climb to new heights, the third-generation real-estate mogul with strong New York political ties is taking some chips off the table.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rechler has agreed to sell a roughly 50% stake in a portfolio of six New York office buildings to private-equity firm <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span> in a deal that values the properties at $4 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. The properties include the landmark Starrett-Lehigh Building on Manhattan's West Side, as well as 340 Madison Ave., 620 Sixth Ave. and 1330 Sixth Ave.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rechler's company, <span class="companylink">RXR Realty</span>, will continue to manage the properties and plans to use the proceeds of the sale to return about all of its investors' equity. The deal's valuation means the investors have generated an annual return of 25% on their money, according to people familiar with the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal is the latest reminder of the New York market's recovery from the financial crisis. An index of Midtown Manhattan office prices stands at a record, 8% above the precrisis peak in 2007, according to research firm Green Street Advisors. The index had fallen 55% from peak to trough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the sale raises the question of how much room there is for further price gains. Green Street, which in 2011 argued that real estate was a better buy than bonds, recently said prices had risen to the point that property was now fairly valued. The danger, according to Green Street analyst Andrew McCulloch, is that interest rates rise without inflation sufficient enough to push rents higher as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rechler, 47 years old, said he believes the New York office market will keep expanding. He pointed out that he still is buying, and he and his investors are keeping a substantial stake in the portfolio <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> is purchasing. "We believe there's still a lot of room to run," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>, the biggest private-equity owner of real estate in the U.S., the deal represents a shifting strategy. The New York-based company has been known mostly for buying properties at sharp discounts to their prices before the financial crisis. This strategy has been to improve the buildings' cash flows and then sell to investors looking for steady and less-risky returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The RXR portfolio, by contrast, is part of <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>'s push into deals that are in between such core investments and riskier properties. Since launching the strategy in early 2014, the firm has amassed more than $3.5 billion in what it calls "core plus" investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The properties <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> is buying from RXR, with a combined 5.3 million square feet of commercial space, have the potential to increase their cash flow. They are about 90% leased, and some tenants are paying below-market rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two sides were advised in the deal by an Eastdil Secured team led by Douglas Harmon and Adam Spies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rechler has a reputation for good timing. In 2006, he sold his company at the time, Reckson Associates Realty Corp., to <span class="companylink">SL Green Realty Corp</span>. for $4 billion. A year later, the market peaked and began a prolonged slide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A fundraiser for Andrew Cuomo in his successful 2010 campaign for New York governor, Mr. Rechler in 2011 was named by Mr. Cuomo to be vice chairman of the <span class="companylink">Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</span>, a position he still holds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest transaction will give Mr. Rechler capital for other projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rechler is the third generation of one of the New York region's real-estate dynasties. The family started out focusing on Long Island industrial buildings in the 1950s and 1960s. Mr. Rechler recalls attending business meetings when he was 7 years old. He started working for the family business full time in 1989 after graduating with a joint degree in economics and political science from Clark University and a master's degree in real-estate finance from <span class="companylink">New York University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rechler became co-chief executive with his uncle at the age of 31. But there was friction between Mr. Rechler and other family members, according to Scott's brother, Gregg. In the early part of the last decade, family members decided to go separate ways and Reckson sold to Mr. Rechler's relatives its portfolio of Long Island industrial properties for about $316 million in cash and Reckson securities, leaving him in control of Reckson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That turned out to be a smart move when SL Green bought Reckson after a bidding battle with billionaire investor Carl Icahn. The value of the properties Reckson owned fell sharply along with most commercial real estate after the 2008 crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rechler started looking for deals soon after the dust settled. He raised money from pension and sovereign-wealth funds to start buying distressed Manhattan assets, which he started doing in 2009. Last year, with values far higher, Mr. Rechler and his investors began talking to <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a dazzling deal," said Mary Ann Tighe, chief executive of the New York region for real-estate-services firm <span class="companylink">CBRE Group Inc</span>. "It makes Scott's current investors delighted, replenishes his capital and gives him a powerful new partner."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growth in home prices quickened at the end of last year -- depending on the region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sale price of an existing home was $208,700 last quarter, up 6% from a year earlier, according to a report released Wednesday by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. That marked a quickening pace from the third quarter, when prices were up by 4.8% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 175 U.S. metro areas covered in the report, 86% registered increases in their median price on finalized sales in the fourth quarter from a year ago. In comparison, only 73% posted year-over-year gains in the third quarter. The biggest gains were seen in some of the areas hardest hit during the housing-market downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Driving the gains: the supply of homes available for sale remained relatively tight and demand was stoked by the improving economy and low interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To wit, the supply of homes available for resale in the fourth quarter amounted to 4.9 months, meaning it would take that long to burn through that inventory at the current sales pace. That's roughly in line with the supply level of the comparable year-earlier period. However, it's short of the supply typically considered representative of a healthy market: six to seven months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The factors driving demand are pretty steady," said Danielle Hale, director of housing statistics for the Realtor association. "The fact that demand is outpacing supply means that we see some acceleration in prices. Mortgage rates were quite low in the fourth quarter, and that played a role."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median prices increased most steeply in several cities in Nevada, Florida and Illinois that are rebounding from dramatic declines, as well as in smaller, booming cities in Texas. The biggest gain came north of Dallas, where the Sherman-Dennison area posted a 21.1% increase from a year ago to a median price of $128,200.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many markets seeing the biggest price declines are in the Midwest and Northeast, led by South Bend, Ind., which was down 7.9%; Hartford, Conn., down 6.8%; Cape Girardeau, Mo., down 6.1%; Reading, Pa., down 5.5%; and Appleton, Wis., down 4.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, some previously hot markets, namely in energy-rich Texas, likely are headed for a slowdown due to ripple effects of the steep decline in oil prices of recent months. On Wednesday, the Houston Association of Realtors reported that pending sales were down 9.3% to 3,382.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The faster pace of home appreciation runs counter to the expectation of many economists that appreciation would start to slow last year and this year as more supply hit the market. But that supply is taking longer to arrive than expected.</p>

That's roughly in line with the supply level of the comparable year-earlier period. However, it's short of the supply typically considered representative of a healthy market: six to seven months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the volume of resales declined by 1% in the fourth quarter from the third to nearly 5.1 million homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The factors driving demand are pretty steady," said Danielle Hale, director of housing statistics for the Realtor association. “The fact that demand is outpacing supply means that we see some acceleration in prices.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some cities seeing the biggest gains simply are small markets that often register big swings from quarter to quarter, Ms. Hale said. Others, like the Naples, Fla., area, still are climbing back from to their historic pricing levels after the downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, some previously hot markets, namely in energy-rich Texas, likely are headed for a slowdown due to economic ripple effects of the steep decline in oil prices of recent months. On Wednesday, the Houston Association of Realtors reported that pending sales were down 9.3% to 3,382.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The faster pace of home appreciation runs counter to the expectation of many economists that appreciation would start to slow last year and this year as more supply hit the market. But that supply is taking longer to arrive than expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors association has posited for months that the solution to the dearth of supply is more home construction. The 435,000 newly built homes that builders sold last year amounted to only 58% of their average annual output since 2000. That malaise might be lifting, since several big builders have reported in recent weeks that their sales have gained momentum since the fourth quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Denver market, where homes listed for sale are scarce, Redfin real-estate agent Karla Kirkpatrick Adams said many homes are attracting multiple offers from would-be buyers. That's likely a factor in Denver area registering a 12.7% increase in its median resale price to $314,800 in the fourth quarter from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I've had clients that were making offers on multiple houses and finding out that there were anywhere from five to 26 offers on every home that we bid on," Ms. Adams said last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Seattle, Redfin agent Klaus Gosma held an open house on Jan. 24 and 25 for one of his listings, a three-bedroom home priced at $350,000. The open house attracted 132 visitors. The house, built in 2008, received five offers and now is under contract for more than the list price. Mr. Gosma attributed the house's popularity to “a combination of low inventory and the price point being super attractive and affordable."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TOKYO—U.S.-based <span class="companylink">LaSalle Investment Management Inc</span>. and sovereign-wealth fund <span class="companylink">China Investment Corp</span>. have teamed up to buy the Meguro Gajoen commercial property complex in Tokyo for around ¥140 billion ($1.2 billion), according to a person familiar with the transaction, the latest sign of renewed strength in the city's property market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The purchase was made in late January by a joint venture with a sovereign-wealth fund, <span class="companylink">LaSalle Investment Management</span> said in a statement Monday, without naming CIC or the price tag. A spokeswoman for LaSalle in Japan declined to comment on the identity of the sovereign-wealth fund or the acquisition cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CIC didn't respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign investors are taking greater interest in Japan's property sector following a sharp depreciation in the value of the yen, a key element of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's economic revitalization program. The currency has lost a third of its value since late 2012, making properties cheaper for foreign investors and sparking interest in sectors from prime office buildings to “salaryman apartments."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Investment appetite for Tokyo remains strong among core investors," said Kunihiko Okumura, head of acquisitions in Japan for LaSalle, referring to long-term investors such as pension funds and sovereign-wealth funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meguro Gajoen includes retail and office space as well as a hotel. The joint venture between LaSalle and CIC bought the property from Mori Trust Co., a Japanese real-estate firm which had bought it in late August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strong returns are also attracting investors to Japanese property. Total returns from property investments in Japan-income plus capital gains-rose to 6.0% in 2013, a fourth consecutive annual rise, according to <span class="companylink">Investment Property Databank Ltd</span>. Meanwhile, total returns on real-estate investments in Asia ex-Japan deteriorated for a third consecutive year to 8.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late October, Singapore sovereign-wealth fund GIC Pte. said it bought 24 floors of Pacific Century Place Marunouchi[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/investors-in-japanese-property-look-beyond-tokyo-1413904531], a building in the prime business district next to Tokyo Station. A person with knowledge of the deal said the cost was US$1.7 billion. U.S. investment firm <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group L.P</span>. said in November that it had reached an agreement to buy General Electric Co.'s residential real-estate business in Japan[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/blackstone-buys-general-electrics-japan-property-portfolio-1416569420] for more than ¥190 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total commercial real-estate investment in Japan increased 17% from the previous year to ¥4.7 trillion in 2014, according to <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle Inc</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. blue chips rose but the broader market was lower Thursday, as the continuing drop in crude-oil prices weighed on energy shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 49 points, or 0.3%, to 17240 at midday. The S&amp;P 500 declined one point, or 0.1%, to 2001, and the Nasdaq Composite fell eight points, or 0.2%, to 4630.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energy stocks had the biggest losses in the S&amp;P 500 as oil prices dropped further. Crude-oil prices fell 1.1% to $43.94 a barrel, prompting a 0.9% energy-stock decline. <span class="companylink">Exxon Mobil</span> and <span class="companylink">Chevron</span> were among the decliners in the Dow, losing 1.5% and 0.9%, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the Dow outperformed other benchmarks, as component <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> rallied 4.3%. The fast-food chain said its chief executive, Don Thompson, was leaving less than three years into his tenure but gave no reason for his departure. Steve Easterbrook, currently chief global brand officer, will succeed Mr. Thompson on March 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the main focus Thursday was corporate earnings reports, traders and strategists said. Steep moves in commodity and currency markets have dented the fourth-quarter results of large international firms, so investors are now trying to determine the outlook for profits in 2015, strategists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The question is how the stronger dollar impacts" earnings, said Monica DiCenso, U.S. head of equity strategy at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. "It certainly doesn't derail our view that you're going to see another solid year of corporate earnings, and another year of solid equity returns."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coach rallied 6.1% after its quarterly earnings declined less than expected, and highlighted a slight improvement in sales at its North American locations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Alibaba Group Holding</span> fell 10%. Revenue fell short of expectations in its latest quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Ford Motor</span>'s pretax profit exceeded expectations and the company forecast stronger results for 2015. Shares edged up 0.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's economic data were mixed as well. The Labor Department said U.S. jobless claims in the latest week fell to the lowest level since April 2000, beating forecasts. Pending home sales made a surprise decline in December, missing economists' forecast a 0.6% rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greek financial markets steadied Thursday following their sharp postelection slump, with battered Greek bank stocks rallying sharply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Athens's main stock index climbed 3.2% as relative calm returned after Wednesday's 9.2% decline in the wake of an election win by the radical leftist Syriza party. The Stoxx Europe 600 eased 0.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European stocks were pressured by a selloff in the energy sector, after <span class="companylink">Royal Dutch Shell</span>'s profit fell short of expectations. Royal Dutch shares slid 4.3%.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Ben Leubsdorf   </div><div>571 words</div><div>29 January 2015</div><div>11:21</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market stumbled into 2015 as a leading indicator of home sales dipped in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> pending home sales index, which tracks contract signings for purchases of previously owned homes, dropped 3.7% in December from the prior month, its largest one-month decline in a year, the trade group said Thursday[http://www.realtor.org/news-releases/2015/01/pending-home-sales-stall-in-december].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected pending home sales would rise 0.6% in December from the prior month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales typically close within a couple months after signings. Thursday's report indicates existing-home sales likely will decline in January, several economists said, a reversal from December's 2.4% gain[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-rose-in-december-1422025293].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The rebound in mortgage applications in recent weeks offers a degree of hope for the spring selling season, but overall housing looks moribund," Pantheon Macroeconomics chief economist Ian Shepherdson said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the pending-sales index rose 6.1% in December from a year earlier for its strongest annual gain since June 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, the NAR's chief economist, said potential buyers last month faced rising prices and fewer choices as housing inventory declined from November. “With interest rates at lows not seen since early 2013, the strength in existing sales in upcoming months will largely depend on the willingness of current homeowners to realize their equity gains from the past couple years and trade up," Mr. Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">News Corp</span>, owner of The Wall Street Journal, also owns <span class="companylink">Move Inc</span>., which operates a website and mobile products for the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing sector posted somewhat lackluster growth in 2014 as it struggled to regain its footing following a mid-2013 jump in mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes, which make up roughly 90% of the U.S. market, strengthened in late 2014. But for the full year, sales fell 3.1% from 2013, according to NAR. Sales of new single-family homes[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/new-home-sales-rise-11-6-in-december-to-481-000-1422371230] picked up in December but rose just 1.2% for the year as a whole compared with 2013, according to the Commerce Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Through the volatility, the trend in home sales is up probably still up, albeit slowly," High Frequency Economics chief U.S. economist Jim O'Sullivan said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts rose 8.8% last year[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/housing-starts-rise-4-4-in-december-1421847270], largely reflecting strong demand for apartment buildings and other multifamily structures, the Commerce Department said. Permits, a forward-looking indicator for residential construction, dipped 1.9% in December from the prior month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates are low, potentially supporting home-buying activity in the spring. The average interest rate[http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/index.html?intcmp=3DCWS-HP] on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is 3.66%, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> said Thursday, down from an average of 4.43% in January 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a recent surge in mortgage applications[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/mortgage-applications-soar-as-consumers-snap-up-low-rates-1421236802] has primarily reflected homeowners looking to refinance, not new home purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Thursday's report, pending home sales declined across the nation in December. The NAR gauge fell 2.6% from November in the South, declined 2.8% in the Midwest, dropped 4.6% in the West and tumbled 7.5% in the Northeast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, the index remained up from a year earlier in all four regions of the country.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">November saw a further downshift in the yearly growth in home prices in many U.S. cities, according to a home price report released Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home price index covering the entire U.S. rose 4.7% in the 12 months ended in November, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index report. While that is up slightly from 4.6% in October, the trend has been steadily lower. In the fall of 2013, U.S. home values were rising at a double-digit pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Narrower measures of home prices showed slower growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home price index covering 10 major U.S. cities increased 4.2% in the year ended in November from a 4.4% rise in October. The 20-city price index grew 4.3%. That is less than the October's 4.5% increase and also below the 4.5% expected by economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On an unadjusted basis, the 10-city gauge dropped 0.3% in November over October, the 20-city measure fell 0,2% and the national index was down 0.1%</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seasonally adjusted, the 10-city and 20-city indexes both advanced 0.7% and the U.S. index was up 0.8% in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">S&amp;P</span> report was cautious about housing in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Difficulties facing the housing recovery include continued low inventory levels and stiff mortgage qualifications," said David M. Blitzer, chairman of the Index Committee at <span class="companylink">S&amp;P</span><span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> Indices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regionally, Miami and San Francisco continued to lead all cities, with gains nearing 9% over the past 12 months.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is getting easier for some buyers to land a house with less money up front.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More lenders are lowering down-payment requirements, allowing borrowers to commit 3% -- or even less -- of a home's purchase price to get a mortgage. Many had been requiring down payments of at least 20% since the recession began.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some lenders also are waiving mortgage-related fees, and more are allowing down payments to be made by other parties, such as the borrower's family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deals are aimed at buyers with good credit scores and a steady income who have been unable to save enough for a sizable down payment. They are often targeted at buyers who live in expensive housing markets, where even a small down payment can equal tens of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low-down-payment mortgages have long been available. The <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span> insures mortgages with down payments as low as 3.5%, and it is lowering the annual mortgage-insurance premiums on new mortgages beginning on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend has picked up since mortgage-finance giants <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, which buy most mortgages from lenders, recently lowered the minimum down payments they will accept to 3% from 5%. The changes are driven by an Obama administration effort to make homeownership affordable to a wider group of buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowers should be aware that small down payments leave them more at risk of owing more on their mortgage than the property is worth should home values in their market decline, says Jack McCabe, an independent housing analyst in Deerfield Beach, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, borrowers likely will incur higher costs over the life of the loan, including higher interest rates and, often, mortgage insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moves come as mortgage originations declined substantially last year. Lenders gave out an estimated $1.12 trillion in mortgages in 2014, down 39% from a year earlier and the lowest amount since 1997, according to the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>, a Washington-based trade group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most mortgages have been going to existing homeowners who are refinancing into lower interest rates, as demand among home buyers has been low compared with historical norms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Regions Bank</span>, a unit of <span class="companylink">Regions Financial</span>, launched a mortgage program in September that allows some borrowers to make a 5% down payment. The bank says it will lower that requirement in the next few weeks to 3%. Borrowers must not have owned a property or had a mortgage in the past three years, among other requirements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TD Bank, the U.S. unit of <span class="companylink">Toronto-Dominion Bank</span>, is allowing first-time buyers to put as little as 3% down through its "Right Step" loan program. The bank -- which also is extending the offer to low- and moderate-income borrowers as well as those purchasing a home in some up-and-coming neighborhoods -- lowered its cash-down requirement from 5% last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The banks allow borrowers' down payments to be partially or fully funded by family, nonprofits or other sources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders also have been lowering the bar for larger mortgages, known as "jumbos," which they typically hold on their books. Such loans exceed $417,000 in most parts of the country and $625,500 in pricier housing markets such as New York and San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November, <span class="companylink">PNC Financial Services Group</span> began allowing exceptions to its down-payment requirements for jumbos, says Tyler Case, a loan officer at PNC's Fords, N.J., branch. The lender, which has been requiring at least 20% down for jumbos up to $1.5 million, lowered that to 15% for borrowers whose income and assets go beyond what the bank generally requires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To qualify, borrowers will need a higher credit score and less debt relative to their income than is usually required, as well as having savings after the home purchase equal to at least 12 months of mortgage payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PNC also is offering exceptions on down-payment amounts for larger loans up to $3 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>, meanwhile, began permitting down payments of as little as 10.1% last year on jumbo mortgages. Previously, its lowest down payment on jumbos was 15%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowers who want to get a mortgage with a particular lender could ask if it would allow a lower down payment than what is officially offered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PNC, for example, isn't advertising its 15% option, Mr. Case says. Instead, it is offering it to eligible borrowers who inquire or mention that they have been offered lower down-payment loans at competitors, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The costs associated with these low-down-payment mortgages can vary significantly. The interest rate and fees borrowers pay often depends on whether the lender plans to sell their mortgage to Fannie or Freddie, or if it plans to hold the loan on its books, in addition to borrowers' qualifications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowers need to compare costs, including the interest rate, whether they have to pay any upfront fees to get that rate and what their total costs to get the loan will be. A lower interest rate might not be a good deal if it requires larger out-of-pocket payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Often, borrowers have to pay an extra fee for private mortgage insurance, which protects the lender from incurring significant losses if the borrower defaults, in exchange for a low down payment. In most cases, the fee is included in the monthly mortgage payment, though borrowers sometimes have the option to pay it as an upfront charge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgages purchased by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> usually require private mortgage insurance if the down payment is less than 20%. Lenders generally decide which mortgage-insurance firm to work with.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowers with higher credit scores, smaller loan amounts and fixed-rate mortgages pay less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The size of the down payment also matters. Typically, someone with a FICO credit score of 760 or more -- on a scale that tops out at 850 -- who is making a down payment of just under 5% and getting a $400,000, 30-year fixed-rate mortgage will incur at least a 0.57% fee, according to <span class="companylink">Radian Guaranty</span>, a unit of <span class="companylink">Radian Group</span>, and <span class="companylink">Mortgage Guaranty Insurance</span>, a unit of <span class="companylink">MGIC Investment</span>, two of the largest private mortgage insurers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That comes out to $190 a month. The same borrower with a down payment of just under 10% would incur a fee of at least 0.43%, or $143 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before signing up, borrowers should find out if they will incur these costs, and for how long. They should consider asking their lender if they can stop paying this fee when they reach at least a 20% equity stake in the home through a mix of home-price appreciation and amortization, for example, says Keith Gumbinger, vice president at mortgage-information website HSH.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders who hold low-down-payment mortgages on their books typically don't require this insurance. But the loans may not be a bargain, he says, because they often charge interest rates that can be an eighth to a quarter of a percentage point higher.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- A burst of groundbreakings for single-family homes last month offered hope that a key segment of the housing market is revving up after years of malaise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts rose 4.4% in December from a month earlier to an annual rate of 1.089 million, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. Starts on single-family homes, which exclude apartments and reflect the bulk of the market, rose to a rate of 728,000, the highest level since March 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits for single-family homes climbed 4.5%, the biggest increase since September 2012. Permits for all private housing, however, fell 1.9% to an annual rate of 1.032 million, amid a decline in demand for apartment construction. Permits are a bellwether for construction activity in coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home-construction market is choppy, and housing-starts data are often revised. Indeed, December's jump in construction followed a sizable drop in November. Starts for all of 2014 rose 8.8%, a steady pace that was slower from the prior two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, December traditionally brings a small volume of construction starts, since most home builders are focused that month on closing home sales before the end of the year. However, an uptick in December starts sometimes can mean builders are gearing up in anticipation of a robust spring selling season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home construction is still weak historically more than five years after the recession. The sluggishness has been puzzling given that mortgage rates have fallen quickly in recent months and job growth surged last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But economists said the latest figures reflected a market steadily, but slowly, recovering from the depths.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kris Hudson   </div><div>828 words</div><div>22 January 2015</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2015, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LAS VEGAS -- One of the hottest debates among housing economists these days isn't the trajectory of home sales, but whether millennials, those born in the 1980s and 1990s, want to remain urbanites or eventually relocate to the suburbs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some demographers and economists argue that the preference of millennials, also called Generation Y, for city living will remain long lasting. And surveys of these young urban residents have tended to show that they don't mind small living quarters as long as they have access to mass transit and are close to entertainment, dining and their workplaces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a survey released Wednesday by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>, a trade group, suggested otherwise. The survey, based on responses from 1,506 people born since 1977, found that most want to live in single-family homes outside of the urban center, even if they now reside in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While you are more likely to attract this generation than other generations to buy a condo or a house downtown, that is a relative term," said Rose Quint, the association's assistant vice president of survey research. "The majority of them will still want to buy the house out there in the suburbs."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey, which was released at the association's convention in Las Vegas, found that 66% want to live in the suburbs, 24% want to live in rural areas and 10% want to live in a city center. One of the main reasons people want to relocate from the city center, she said, is that they "want to live in more space than they have now." The survey showed 81% want three or more bedrooms in their home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The preferences of millennials are important to nearly every U.S. industry because of their size, which is estimated at between 70 and 80 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not since the baby boomers, a generation that counts roughly 76 million people, has there been such a big population bulge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For home builders, the survey results carry particular importance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The preference for the suburbs suggests that future demand will be in the form of single-family homes rather than condominiums more prevalent in cities," said David Berson, chief economist with <span class="companylink">Nationwide Insurance Co</span>. "That's also good news for future suburban single-family sellers, many of whom are baby boomers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey results, though, could be skewed because they included only millennials who first answered that they bought a home within the past three years or intended to do so in the next three years. That excluded young people who intend to rent for many more years, which is a large and growing group, in part because of hefty student debt and the tight mortgage-lending standards of recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The homeownership rate among heads of household 35 years of age or younger was at 36% in last year's third quarter, the most recent data available. That is the lowest figure since the Commerce Department started tracking the data on a quarterly basis in 1994 and well short of the recent high of 43.1% in the third quarter of 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another factor leading to fewer young people buying homes is that women are waiting until later in life to have their first child. The average age of a mother at her first childbirth was 25.4 years in 2010, up from 22.7 in 1980, federal statistics show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stockton Williams, executive director of the Terwilliger Center for Housing at the Urban Land Institute, a nonprofit research group, said that many millennials still don't have the financial resources to buy a home in the aftermath of the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There may be a strong interest, but there might also be a recognition that, at least for some, the opportunity to own a home might have to wait," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some millennials said that they prefer to live in a house, but still enjoy living close to the city center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Karla Kingsley, a 32-year-old transportation consultant, and her fiance bought a single-family home last month in Portland, Ore., for $375,000, she said the couple's top priorities were finding a home close to restaurants, shops and their workplaces downtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That was most important to us, to be able to walk to things from our house and to bike to work," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kent Piacenti, a 33-year-old commercial litigation lawyer and his partner, took a similar approach when they bought a three-bedroom home less than four miles from downtown Dallas this month. The couple, who previously rented an apartment downtown, wanted more space for their two dogs and a pool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My absolute preference is to be as close to the city center as possible to be near work and near friends," Mr. Piacenti said. "Our entire work and social network is in the city center."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lowe's Cos</span>. will hire about 5,000 more seasonal employees this year than last, as the retailer remains optimistic that the recovery in the housing market will continue spurring more home-improvement projects in the warmer months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, this year's 30,000 hiring number is still down from the 45,000 seasonal workers hired in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seasonal employees, which typically work about 20 hours a week, are most needed from February until September, when warmer weather has people working more outdoors. Hiring has begun in warmer states, such as Florida, California, Texas and Arizona, the company said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> and peer <span class="companylink">Home Depot Inc</span>. have been bright spots in the retail sector as they continue to benefit from the U.S. housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> said it sees encouraging signs in the housing market, pegging consumer confidence in the market at prerecession highs. In November, it raised its outlook as sales and profit for the most recently ended quarter grew. Chief Executive Robert A. Niblock said then that the outlook comes as customers, buoyed by lower fuel prices and interest rates as well as appreciation in home values, are looking to invest in their homes more now than at any point since 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> operates more than 1,800 home-improvement and hardware stores in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> are up about 42% in the past 12 months through Tuesday's close.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LAS VEGAS -- Sales of new and existing homes were lackluster last year, but there is an air of optimism running through this year's gathering of home builders, contractors and suppliers at the home-building industry's annual convention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>' International Builders Show, combined with the Kitchen &amp; Bath Industry Show, is expected to attract 125,000 attendees and occupy 750,000 square feet of meeting and showroom space at the Las Vegas Convention Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is the largest edition of the trade show in many years, due partly to its consolidation with other shows and partly to the gradual recovery of the home-building market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The show brings with it mildly upbeat outlooks for the spring home-buying season, which unofficially begins after the Super Bowl on Feb. 1 and typically hits its stride in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As we head into 2015, the entire building industry is cautiously optimistic that better times lie ahead," said Larry Webb, chief executive of California builder New Home Co., who plans to attend the show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A stronger housing market can fuel growth of the broader economy. Not only does home construction and remodeling generate employment, but the jobs tend to have high paychecks. The builders association calculates that the construction of a single-family home creates three full-time jobs for a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors chief economist, Lawrence Yun, estimates that new-home sales will rise 41% to 624,000 this year from 2014 and that construction starts for single-family houses will rise by nearly 32% to 840,000. The builders association's economists predict gains of almost 30% in sales of new single-family homes and 25.5% in single-family construction starts.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shenzhen real-estate developer Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd. likely became one of the first Chinese property companies to default on offshore bonds Thursday. A Page One article in the Friday-Sunday edition about the company incorrectly said it would be the first to do so. In 2009, Chinese property firm Neo-China Land Group Ltd. missed a coupon payment for offshore bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(WSJA January 13, 2015)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHENZHEN, China -- A Shenzhen real-estate developer with seemingly sound finances likely became the first Chinese property company to default on offshore bonds Thursday, in a development that is raising concerns among global investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd</span>. appears to have missed interest payments due on $500 million of debt held by foreign investors, several managers of funds that hold the bonds said. Although the company has a 30-day grace period to pay after the due date, missing the deadline would put Kaisa in technical default, analysts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday evening, a Kaisa representative said he didn't know whether the company had paid. More than two dozen foreign fund companies, ranging from <span class="companylink">BlackRock Inc</span>. to <span class="companylink">Fidelity Investments</span> and <span class="companylink">Lion Global Investors</span>, owned Kaisa debt in recent months, according to Thomson Reuters, although it isn't clear how many currently hold the debt. BlackRock and <span class="companylink">Fidelity</span> declined to comment, while a spokesperson for Lion Global, a Singapore-based fund company, said it has sold its holdings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several fund managers said the situation is heightening market fears, making foreign investors wary of Chinese property bonds overall and anxious about whether other seemingly healthy companies in the sector could melt down as well. Kaisa's difficulties, which appear to stem from government intervention in a real-estate company, have added to concern about the risk of investing in Chinese bonds more broadly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Within a four-week period, we had this almost collapsing situation in Kaisa's operating profile, which would heighten investors' sensitivity to the sector," said Charles Macgregor, Asia head at the credit-research firm Lucror Analytics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A default, if confirmed, would be the more shocking because it was so unexpected, investors say. Kaisa was seen as in good financial shape, with a healthy portfolio of commercial and residential projects, strong sales and solid cash flow that had made its bonds popular with investors. Kaisa's net profit in the first half of 2014, the latest figures available, rose 30% from the previous year to 1.33 billion yuan ($214 million), with revenue of 6.79 billion yuan. As of June 30, the 16-year-old company, which is listed on the Hong Kong exchange, had cash of 9.38 billion yuan versus short-term debt of six billion yuan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But during the space of the past few months, the Shenzhen government has blocked approvals of Kaisa developments and property sales in the city, home to some of its major developments -- actions the company said in a Dec. 21 statement could have "an adverse impact on cash flow." Kaisa's founder and longtime chairman, Kwok Ying Shing, has quit, along with a number of top executives and board members. Neither the government nor Kaisa executives have offered explanations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Jan. 1, the developer said it defaulted on a $51.6 million loan from <span class="companylink">HSBC Holdings PLC</span>, and credit raters <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> and Moody's Investors Service have downgraded Kaisa's debt from just below investment grade to ratings that reflect an expected default. Kaisa's bond prices have plunged more than 80% since the end of November and are now trading at around 33 cents on the dollar. Its stock price has fallen more than 60% to 1.59 Hong Kong dollars over the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trading in the stock has been halted since Dec. 29.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many Chinese property companies are heavily indebted, struggling with a weak housing market and difficulties in raising cash to pay back loans. Worries are mounting over the impact of China's economic slowdown and the rising amount of debt among local government-connected financing vehicles, though recent government efforts to ease funding conditions have relieved some concerns. China has $55.7 billion in offshore property debt, according to Dealogic, a data-tracking company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kaisa, founded by Mr. Kwok in 1999, seemed to be one of the sector's stronger firms. The company has grown rapidly over the past few years: It employed about 9,500 people as of the middle of last year, up from 2,700 in 2009. In the first 11 months of last year, Kaisa's sales totaled 3.72 billion yuan, double the amount in the same period in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company was ranked No. 1 in residential-property sales in Shenzhen during the first half of 2014, according to SZHome.com, an industry website.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Current and former employees say the company emphasizes efficiency and encourages employees to make simple decisions, such as the approval of subcontractors or expenses, within four hours. Industry insiders say that Kaisa has a reputation for finishing large projects within a year, a pace that is faster than the industry average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October, however, the Chinese government said a high-ranking Communist Party official who had been associated with Shenzhen's Longgang district, where Kaisa is developing several big projects, had been placed under investigation. State media later said the investigation was related to corruption in real estate. Some Chinese media also reported that Mr. Kwok had been detained or was unreachable, which the company denied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late November, Kaisa discovered that some sales and construction had been blocked by the Shenzhen government, the company said in a December statement. Later, it found that other approvals and projects had been blocked as well. Authorities in Longgang notified Kaisa in December that it had suspended processing of approvals and applications for all of the company's construction projects in the district, Kaisa said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At one of those projects in Longgang, the Kaisa City Plaza, staff at a sales center containing a grand staircase, marble floors, crystal chandeliers, gold-plated bathroom fixtures and a small projection theater were still showing around prospective buyers on a recent afternoon. As the sound of whirring saws rose from inside the development, employees said Kaisa could finish work on existing structures but could no longer sell property or begin new construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside the complex, some homeowners had gathered looking for information, with one saying she was nervous about her recent purchase of a three-bedroom apartment there. The homeowners said they had received little information from Kaisa about the state of their properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One woman, who asked to be identified only by her surname, Ye, said she had bought property from Kaisa two years ago, and is confident the current problems will be resolved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Kaisa is well known," she said. "The quality of their housing is good, and their locations are good. I'm still coming to look."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market failed to provide the lift to the economy over the past year that many analysts expected. It enters a new year with few signs pointing to either a renewed breakout or a sharp slowdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New data released this week showed that contracts signed to buy previously owned homes rose to the third-highest level of the past year, the latest sign of how housing demand firmed up in 2014 after a sluggish start.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Wednesday that its index measuring pending home sales in November -- reflecting sales that have gone into contract but haven't yet closed -- rose 0.8% from October and 4.1% from a year earlier on a seasonally adjusted basis. That represents the largest year-over-year gain for the index since August 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as a whole, the housing market fell short of expectations amid tepid demand, rising prices and continued complaints from buyers about the quality of inventory. "The market overpriced itself this year, and buyers are very price-sensitive right now," said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of real-estate brokerage Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a two-year rebound, housing demand faltered halfway through 2013 amid inventory shortages, rising prices and a sudden increase in mortgage rates. Demand stayed soft in early 2014, during a particularly cold winter, but improved in the summer, a period during which mortgage rates floated down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage stood at 3.87% for the week ended Wednesday, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, near its lowest level of the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes ran around 4% below the year-earlier level through the first 11 months of 2014. Still, sales climbed throughout the middle of the past year, from a 4.59 million seasonally adjusted annual rate in March to 5.25 million in October. They slid 6% in November to a 4.93 million rate, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes have been essentially unchanged over the past year, falling far short of economists' expectations for double-digit gains in new-home sales. That has happened in part because builders have focused on constructing larger, more expensive homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Broad sales measures don't fully capture other dimensions of the housing market's recovery. In particular, the share of homes selling out of foreclosure accounted for as many as a third of home sales in 2012. The share of distressed sales has fallen sharply, to around 9% in recent months. The upshot is that traditional sales now account for a far larger share of the market -- a sign of improvement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices tell a similar story. After falling nearly one-third from their peak in 2006, prices began rebounding sharply in February 2012 and since then have risen nearly 25% through October, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the price declines were exacerbated by a glut of foreclosures. The subsequent rebound reflected increased investor demand for those bargain-priced properties, most of which were either quickly repaired and flipped for a profit or held off the market as rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As foreclosures have faded and investor-purchasers stepped back from the market, price gains have slowed. In October, home prices had increased 4.6% from their year-earlier level, compared with a year-over-year gain of 10.9% in October 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An open question in the coming year is whether price gains stabilize at those lower levels or whether they weaken further. Research firm Zelman &amp; Associates expects price gains of 4% in 2015 and 3% in 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some market specialists say prices may need to give if sales are to rise. "In a few markets, there will be price declines," Mr. Kelman said, "and maybe in more than a few."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yearly growth in home prices across the U.S. continued to moderate early in the fourth quarter, suggesting the housing market may be settling into a more sustainable recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices nationwide increased 4.6% in the year ended in October, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller home-price report released Tuesday. That was down from 4.8% in September and a far cry from the 10%-plus gains in the first quarter. A 20-city measure more closely followed by economists increased 4.5% over the year in October, also down sharply from double-digit gains earlier in the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for housing has slowed significantly in recent months despite stronger job growth, a rebound in consumer confidence and falling gasoline prices, which puts more money into consumers' pockets. Sales of both new and existing homes fell in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the slowing trend is a positive for the 2015 housing outlook, say economists who follow the industry. Price appreciation of about 5% is close to a sweet spot where more buyers are able to purchase a home and current owners accumulate housing wealth, but the market avoids a price bubble that could trigger a financial crisis, as happened in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a healthier market because first-time buyers feel more comfortable about coming in," said Bill Banfield, vice president of capital markets at mortgage lender Quicken Loans, adding that the industry needs more first-time buyers to buy smaller homes that allow existing owners to move up into new construction or to an existing house that better suits their needs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For 2014, however, first-time buyers accounted for only 29% of existing-home sales, according to data from the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>, much less than the historical norm of 40% for sales of primary residences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists at IHS Global Insight agree slower price appreciation is a positive for the housing outlook. "Home appreciation at a reasonable pace makes homeownership an attainable dream," said Stephanie Karol, a U.S. economist at IHS Global. A repeat of the double-digit growth seen in early 2014 "would risk producing a bubble," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But just as each real-estate market is local, she pointed out the Case-Shiller price index of 20 cities masks the individual pricing experience going on across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Prices are rising fastest in cities such as San Francisco where geographic or legal constraints limit new construction," Ms. Karol said. Cities with fewer zoning laws and more space -- such as Charlotte, N.C., and Phoenix -- are seeing smaller price gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the average home-price gain of about 5% is good, she said, and IHS Global is upbeat about home demand and prices in 2015. The forecasting firm projects home prices, as measured by an index compiled by the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span>, will increase 5% over the course of next year and sales of new and existing homes will average 5.92 million, up from 2014's current pace of about 5.3 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Key to the outlook is expectations of faster wage growth. IHS forecasts wages will grow 2.7% in 2015, better than the 2% or so yearly pace seen throughout most of the expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are seeing hints that prices could end 2014 on a strong note and accelerate into 2015," said David M. Blitzer, chairman of the Index Committee at <span class="companylink">S&amp;P</span><span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> Indices. In addition, Mr. Blitzer said, strong economic growth and falling unemployment were positives for the housing outlook.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You recap a recent <span class="companylink">Congressional Budget Office</span> report indicating that <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> could be replaced by private companies over the next 10 years and that “Life Without Fannie and Freddie”[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/life-without-fannie-and-freddie-1419635987] (Review &amp; Outlook, Dec. 27) would not be so bad for the housing market. Mortgage rates for some borrowers would go up a little as Fan and Fred reduce taxpayer-backed guarantees. House prices might drop by a small percentage, but that also would make housing marginally more affordable for renters and first-time buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One big benefit of mortgage-market privatization cited by the <span class="companylink">CBO</span> is that it would incentivize “financial institutions to be prudent in their lending and securitizing because private investors, rather than taxpayers, would bear all losses.” As you note, however, mortgage-market reform faces an uphill battle because of “the housing lobby’s hooks into both political parties.” Another major impediment to reform is that many in Congress are passionate about prudent lending only when house prices go down. Prior to the housing-market collapse, Congress had few misgivings about relaxing lending standards to accommodate borrowing by those with poor credit records and low down payments. Then, for five post-crash years, the same members of Congress climbed on their high horses and screamed about the imprudent standards of greedy bankers. Now that there has been a modest rebound in house prices, banks are encouraged to resume making loans to less-qualified borrowers. Either the criteria for “prudent lending” are as variable as cyclical prices in the housing market or the default position of Congress is to prioritize social engineering over lending standards, as long as bankers are standing by to be piñatas when necessary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fact that the <span class="companylink">CBO</span> believes private lenders will be more prudent when private investors, not taxpayers, absorb all losses on loans is an indictment of Washington—the White House and Congress—as a catalyst for the housing-market meltdown. If Washington truly wanted prudent lending, it never would have inserted government guarantees into the marketplace. As a general rule, it is not possible to owe $18 trillion and support prudent standards for any purpose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeff Adams</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlanta</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bravo to the <span class="companylink">Congressional Budget Office</span> for its report on how to phase out Fannie and Freddie! And bravo to you for telling us about it. The free-market benefit alone would be worth the effort, not to mention the relief of risk to taxpayers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But until the Supreme Court puts a fork in “disparate impact” doctrine and a new administration dismantles the racialist network of bureaucrats driving the current jihad against businesses that engage in the very rational gauging of risk based on the individual records of would be customers, private bankers will have little hope of avoiding extortionate demands by a rogue Justice Department under Democratic regimes of the future. Who would want to take that risk?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home Sales' Foundations Crack</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market has gone wobbly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes in November were down 1.6% from a year ago, according to Commerce Department data last week. Existing-home sales for that month were down 6.1%. The monthly survey of U.S. home builders from housing-research firm John Burns Real Estate Consulting Inc. found the per-community sales pace shrank by an average of 20% in November, year over year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This slowdown may not be fully evident in the Case-Shiller/S&amp;P Home Price Index figures due Tuesday. Those have a three-month lag; the newest report will reflect home-price changes in October. Even so, the trend hasn't been promising. September's report showed annual home-price growth in the 20-city index slowing 0.7 percentage points to 4.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was the index's first reading below 5% since 2012. It also marked the 10th consecutive month of slowing home-price gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pending-home-sales report for November, due Wednesday, may not offer relief, either. Pending home sales -- which reflect contract signings as opposed to closings -- showed a 1.1% decline in October compared with September. A similar decline in November pending sales could signal a swifter deceleration in the housing market than many anticipate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank lending also augurs a slower housing market. The aggregate amount of real-estate loans held by commercial banks in the U.S. stopped growing in August, according to <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> data. Seasonally adjusted, it actually declined slightly in November, the first month-to-month slip since October 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, a double-digit percentage-change rate of home-price growth isn't sustainable, so some slowing is to be expected. But how much?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices have been playing catch-up in the wake of the housing bust. But over the very long term, prices tend not to appreciate more rapidly than inflation. There, too, prospects aren't bright. <span class="companylink">The Fed</span>'s expectation is for inflation to run at 1% to 1.6% next year, although that may be too high given oil's swift fall. Yet <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>, the largest U.S. home lender, expects home prices to rise 3% next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That looks too optimistic. If this week's data signal further contraction, housing may end up being the odd man out in 2015 amid a strengthening U.S. economy.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Fiona Law  </div><div>711 words</div><div>29 December 2014</div><div>04:14</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asian companies issued record amounts of bonds this year, but some of that debt is turning sour as falling oil prices and a shakeout in China's housing market hit energy companies and real-estate developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil-and-gas companies and property developers were the biggest issuers in the year through mid-December, raising a combined 44% of the region's corporate bonds issued in U.S. dollars, euros and yen, figures from data provider Dealogic show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The debt-market boom has been fueled by yield-hungry money managers turning to Asia as the world's major central banks keep interest rates low. At the same time, companies are eager to load up on cheap debt ahead of expected increases in global borrowing costs next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a steady decline in new-home prices in major Chinese cities, as developers compete to reduce inventory, has hit Chinese property companies hard, dragging their bond prices down by as much as 25% since early December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Problems are cropping up throughout the sector. Midsize developer <span class="companylink">Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd</span>. said last week that home sales at many of its residential- and commercial-property projects in Shenzhen, where it is based, have been blocked by the local government. The company didn't elaborate and the reasons for the government's action aren't known.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, the yield on Kaisa's three-year bonds surged as high as 28% from 13.9% on Friday, after two of the company's senior executives resigned. Yields move inversely to prices. The company didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil companies are also being battered as falling energy prices erode profit margins. Chinese oil producer <span class="companylink">Cnooc Ltd</span>.'s short-term bonds have lost around 2% in value from a June peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Given the drop in commodity prices, investors have become more cautious," said Herman van den Wall Bake, Asia head of fixed income capital markets at <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank AG</span>. He said the lack of market liquidity at year-end has contributed to volatile bond prices. “Investors and dealers alike are not keen on loading the boat in this environment."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks also have been hit as investors pull cash out of Asia's emerging markets. The MSCI AC Asia ex-Japan Index, a broad measure of equities across the region, fell 12.6% since early September before rebounding 3% over recent sessions. Outflows from the region's equity markets totaled $3 billion in the three weeks through Dec. 10, according to EPFR data and ANZ Research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And analysts say Asian equity and bond markets could slump further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The region is likely to be dragged down as losses hit global emerging-market portfolios and fund managers start to raise cash in anticipation of potential redemption," said Edwin Chan, head of Asia credit research at <span class="companylink">UBS AG</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As market liquidity declines in December, investors will need to resort to selling the still-liquid assets to raise cash," Mr. Chan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil companies in Asia could sail through the storm, except for some small competitors, analysts say, as most of them enjoy state support and have ample cash from a favorable operating environment over the past few years. But property developers could see more headwinds despite recent steps by Beijing to boost the economy. China's central bank [http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/china-to-ease-rules-to-boost-lending-1419503156] cut its benchmark interest rate last month and is introducing measures such as relaxing banks' ability to use deposits to issue loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, if the price of oil keeps falling, there will be a “negative spiral effect to other commodities prices, like coal, copper, palm oil and so forth. In particular, Southeast Asian governments' current-account position would deteriorate as most nations there are big net exporters of these commodities," said Arthur Lau, head of Asia ex-Japan fixed income at <span class="companylink">PineBridge Investments</span>. He said markets will be even choppier in the first half of next year.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jonathan Clements   </div><div>792 words</div><div>28 December 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Sunday</div><div>SNJR</div><div>WSJ1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, I sold one apartment and bought another. It was a reminder that the words “home” and “investment” don’t belong in the same sentence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don’t get me wrong: I’m all in favor of home ownership. The tax breaks are impressive. Home ownership forces us to save: With each mortgage payment, we whittle down the loan balance, so eventually we own a valuable asset free and clear. Most important, a home provides us with a place to live. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what about the price appreciation? According to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, home prices have climbed just 3.7% a year over the past 30 years, not much above the 2.8% inflation rate. To make matters worse, this figure doesn’t reflect the hefty costs of buying, owning and selling a home. What if you include those? Consider one columnist’s sorry tale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carrying Costs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a topic I’ve tackled before, most notably in a June 2005 Wall Street Journal Sunday article entitled “How Houses Eat Money.” That column, which appeared a year before the real-estate bubble peaked, detailed how I had fared financially with the home I then owned in New Jersey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In that article, I noted that the house might fetch $500,000, or triple my 1992 purchase price of $165,000. But I also noted that I had incurred a fistful of costs along the way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What costs? Forget the $106,000 in interest I coughed up during the 12 years it took to pay off the mortgage. Arguably, that was the price I paid not to rent, plus the goal here is to look at price appreciation, regardless of whether a home buyer takes out a mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, forget routine maintenance expenses, home owners insurance at around $500 a year and the $9,000 in closing costs when I bought the house. In addition, we won’t put any value on the countless hours I sunk into the place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, to my purchase price, let’s add just two expenses: home improvements and property taxes. Admittedly, I spent a considerable sum fixing up a rundown home and I was living in a state notorious for its high property taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the 20 years I owned the New Jersey home, I calculate that I spent $183,000 on home improvements and $90,000 on property taxes. (The latter number was actually larger, but I gave it a 25% haircut because property taxes can be deducted on your federal income-tax return.) Add that to the purchase price and my total cost was $438,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, by the time I unloaded the place in 2012, the property market was in a deep slump—and I ended up accepting an offer of $409,000. Sound grim? It gets worse. After a 5% real-estate broker’s commission, transfer taxes and other costs, I walked away with $377,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, it was a terrible time to sell a home, but a great time to be a buyer. A year earlier, I purchased an apartment in New York City for $570,000, plus $7,000 for title insurance, attorney fees and other costs. I sold that apartment last month for $800,000, so I could buy a place with more space just outside the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That profit more than offset the loss on the New Jersey home, though maybe not as much as readers might think. Why not? By the time I paid a 4% brokerage commission, transfer taxes and other expenses, I pocketed a little over $750,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three Lessons </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If I subtract my New Jersey loss from my New York profit, I made just $5,000 a year over my 22 years of home ownership—and the number would be far smaller if I hadn’t excluded a bunch of costs. What’s the implication? Three lessons stand out:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"> Over the long run, you’re unlikely to make much from home-price appreciation, especially once you figure in costs. Got friends who boast that their home has been a great investment? Quiz them about how much they forked over for closing costs, insurance, property taxes, home improvements and more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"> Real estate is a horribly expensive asset to buy, and especially to sell. Costs took 8% of the proceeds from my New Jersey house and 6% from my New York apartment. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"> The big gain from owning a home is getting to live there. Think about how much you’d collect if you rented out your home. You might pull in an annual sum equal to 6% or 7% of your home’s value—far more than you’re likely to make each year from price appreciation.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- New-home sales fell for the second straight month in November, pointing to underlying weakness in the housing market despite ultralow interest rates and sturdy economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of newly built single-family homes dropped 1.6% in November from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted rate of 438,000, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. Sales were down by the same rate over the prior 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New homes are only a 10th of the overall housing market and the data are subject to big revisions. But the report came a day after a major industry group reported that existing-home sales -- the bulk of the market -- also fell in November, hitting a six-month low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weakness in housing is puzzling given that the broader U.S. economy is, by several measures, posting its strongest growth in years. The government reported Tuesday the nation's gross domestic product grew at a 5% annual rate in the third quarter, the fastest pace in 11 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Soft November new-home sales are consistent with what has been a slow and choppy recovery in the housing sector," <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> economist Jesse Hurwitz said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other economists said home sales are bound to pick up over the next year as more Americans get jobs and their incomes grow. But several factors might impede a stronger housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices rose quickly in recent years, driven in part by all-cash purchases from investors, who are now retreating from the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen pointed last week to tight lending standards as another culprit, saying she believes many Americans who lack clean credit histories can't obtain loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But mortgage rates remain near historic lows, which in theory should entice more Americans to buy. After rising last year, the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has again slipped below 4%, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday's report showed the stock of new homes for sale built up. At the November selling pace, it would take 5.8 months to exhaust the supply of newly built homes on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price of the typical home has climbed. The median price of a newly built home stood at $280,900 in November, up from $277,100 a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales fell last month in the Northeast, Midwest and South but rose in the West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some home builders say the latest weakness may be seasonal and that conditions will improve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">November is a slow month for new-home sales as builders focus most of their attention on completing pending home sales before the end of the year rather than signing new contracts. The month traditionally ranks 11th in contract volume, ahead of only December, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, several builders reported an increase in contract volume in November, with some citing the slowly improving economy and increasing consumer confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Riverview, Fla., Willy Nunn, president and principal of closely held builder Homes by WestBay, described himself as "cautiously optimistic about the spring" after WestBay sold 30 houses in November. That's up from 18 in October and 12 in November 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nunn speculated that buyers felt less anxiety about the economy and world events after the negative campaigning of the election season ended in early November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Clearly, we feel like there is a greater interest and optimism regarding home buying," Mr. Nunn said. "However, it's still all based on a small sample size. We hit it right in several communities in different parts of town, which tells me that there's something systemic there."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Setai Hotel Is Sold</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An investment company controlled by the founders of <span class="companylink">Jordache Enterprises</span> of designer-jeans fame has cut a deal to buy Miami Beach's Setai hotel for about $90 million, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nakash Holdings is buying the hotel, which has about 90 rooms and 170 condo units, from the estate of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc</span>. Originally built in the 1930s, the Art Deco Setai is one of the most prominent hotels in Miami Beach, with guests including former President Bill Clinton, the singer Bono and rapper Kanye West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nakash is the investment company of Joseph, Avi and Ralph Nakash, who built Jordache jeans into a global brand. Nakash owns a wide range of other real estate, including the Versace mansion in Miami Beach and the Bond Building, located near the White House in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan Bennett, Nakash's managing director, declined to comment on the terms of the deal but said that the Setai is well known to some Nakash family members who spend time in the Miami Beach area. "When it came up for sale, it made a lot of sense for us," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bennett said Nakash may decide to build on the Setai's popularity in Miami to expand the brand to other cities. "We're buying a jewel," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Catering to Seniors</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The aging of the baby boom generation combined with the flood of capital into commercial real estate is driving up prices of properties that cater to senior living.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Case in point: <span class="companylink">Senior Housing Properties Trust Inc</span>. said Tuesday it is buying 38 senior-living communities from <span class="companylink">CNL Lifestyle Properties Inc</span>. for $790 million. The properties, in 12 states including California, Georgia, Washington and Oregon, total 3,466 units at nursing homes and assisted-living communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The income from the properties translates to an initial yield in the low 6% range, according to an estimate by Daniel Bernstein, an analyst with <span class="companylink">Stifel Nicolaus &amp; Co</span>. Average yields on comparable properties -- known as capitalization rates -- have fallen from about 6.3% a year ago to about 5.8% today, according to Green Street Advisors, a sign of rising prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts say demand for space at senior-living centers has been growing thanks in part to improving house prices in many markets, enabling many seniors to sell their homes. Also the economy is strengthening, financing is becoming more available and commercial real estate of all types has become more attractive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's market "feels very much like 2004," said Mr. Bernstein in a recent client note. "The availability of capital and leverage is driving it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Robbie Whelan</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand Drives Up</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building Costs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building costs are rising at the fastest pace in six years, according to a new report by Rider Levett Bucknall, a property and construction consulting firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm -- which tracks the costs of new commercial, residential and other buildings -- said its index of construction costs in the U.S. increased 1.66% between July 1 and Oct. 1, the largest three-month increase since early 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm attributed the increase to the improving construction-financing climate and stronger commercial- and residential-development markets. Experts say that as markets improve, demand increases for labor and construction materials, driving up their costs. The report points out that, according to the Commerce Department, the value of construction put-in-place in the first nine months of 2014 was $710.1 billion, up 6.1% from a year earlier. The report predicts that construction starts in 2015 will rise about 10%, almost double the estimated growth rate of 2014.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The aging of the baby boom generation combined with the flood of capital into commercial real estate is driving up prices of properties that cater to senior living.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Case in point: <span class="companylink">Senior Housing Properties Trust Inc</span>. said Tuesday it is buying 38 senior-living communities from <span class="companylink">CNL Lifestyle Properties Inc</span>. for $790 million. The properties, in 12 states including California, Georgia, Washington and Oregon, total 3,466 units at nursing homes and assisted-living communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The income from the properties translates to an initial yield in the low 6% range, according to an estimate by Daniel Bernstein, an analyst with <span class="companylink">Stifel Nicolaus &amp; Co</span>. Average yields on comparable properties—known as capitalization rates—have fallen from about 6.3% a year ago to about 5.8% today, according to Green Street Advisors, a sign of rising prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts say demand for space at senior-living centers has been growing thanks in part to improving house prices in many markets, enabling many seniors to sell their homes. Also the economy is strengthening, financing is becoming more available and commercial real estate of all types has become more attractive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's market “feels very much like 2004," said Mr. Bernstein in a recent client note. “The availability of capital and leverage is driving it."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand Drives Up Building Costs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building costs are rising at the fastest pace in six years, according to a new report by Rider Levett Bucknall, a property and construction consulting firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm—which tracks the costs of new commercial, residential and other buildings—said its index of construction costs in the U.S. increased 1.66% between July 1 and Oct. 1, the largest three-month increase since early 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm attributed the increase to the improving construction-financing climate and stronger commercial- and residential-development markets. Experts say that as markets improve, demand increases for labor and construction materials, driving up their costs. The report points out that—according to the U.S. Commerce Department—the value of construction put-in-place in the first nine months of 2014 was $710.1 billion, up 6.1% from the same period in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report predicts that construction starts in 2015 will rise about 10%, almost double the estimated growth rate of 2014. “General optimism with the construction sector has continued to rise," the report says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of Malaysia's most prominent casino developers was a big behind-the-scenes winner last week when a New York board made its much-awaited recommendations of where three casinos should be located.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Lim Kok Thay's investment company, <span class="companylink">Kien Huat Realty</span> of Malaysia, is the controlling shareholder of <span class="companylink">Empire Resorts Inc</span>., which got the nod to build what would be the closest Las Vegas-style casino to New York City. Empire's partner in its bid is <span class="companylink">EPR Properties</span>, which owns the land in Thompson, N.Y., where the 80,000 square foot Montreign Resort Casino would be developed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lim's family has been a major player in the Asian gambling industry. It controls the Genting Highlands Resort, a gaming destination in the mountains near Kuala Lumpur, a Singapore casino and a range of other businesses including Star Cruises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, Mr. Lim has been increasingly active in the U.S. gambling business. One of Genting's subsidiaries, Resorts World Casino New York City, operates a racetrack and “racino" near New York's JFK Airport. Empire Resorts owns a harness-racing track and racino in Monticello, N.Y.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Montreign casino, which would include a 391-room hotel, would cost about $630 million to develop, according to Emanuel Pearlman, the chairman of Empire Resorts. He said <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse AG</span> has committed to provide $477 million in senior debt and that Empire Resorts would raise $180 million in equity through a rights offering backstopped by Kien Huat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pearlman said Empire Resorts is now waiting for the <span class="companylink">New York Gaming Commission</span> to give the project the necessary license to move forward. “We can't wait to start building," Mr. Pearlman said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of previously owned homes tumbled to a six-month low in November, a sign the housing market continues to underperform despite a burst of stronger economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales declined 6.1% in November from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.93 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Monday. That was the lowest level since May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">November's sales were 2.1% higher than a year ago and followed a particularly strong October, when sales reached their highest level of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun called last month's decline puzzling given strong job creation, rising consumer confidence, low interest rates and near-record stock-market levels. "Factors for improving home sales are rising," Mr. Yun said. "Today's decline, which is a large decline, is a bit puzzling, and I think it will be a one-month aberration."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He pointed to several possible reasons for the latest drop. Tightening inventory levels, exacerbated by weak home construction, have left consumers with fewer choices. And stock-market volatility in October may have rattled prospective buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The outlook remains cloudy because borrowing costs are expected to rise next year if the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> follows through on plans to raise short-term interest rates, which have been near zero since the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 3.80% last week, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, down from 4.53% at the start of the year. Meantime, the U.S. is on track to post its strongest year of job growth since 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The weaker existing-home sales report suggests that the housing market remains on a somewhat rocky footing as data remains quite choppy," said Gennadiy Goldberg, economist at <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span>. "We suspect that the recent decline in mortgage rates could help provide a near-term boost to activity over the coming months, but believe that further housing market improvement is likely to remain quite gradual."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">News Corp</span>, owner of The Wall Street Journal, also owns <span class="companylink">Move Inc</span>., which operates a website and mobile products for the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Previously owned homes represent about 90% of all homes sold. After falling in late 2013, sales have risen steadily this year amid a decline in mortgage rates and stronger job growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But sales remain weak historically, with the Fed saying in its policy statement last week that the housing sector remains "slow."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed ChairwomanJanet Yellen told reporters tight credit is likely a factor, with borrowers who lack pristine credit histories having a hard time obtaining loans. But she said she believes housing will pick up as the labor market improves.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners sold far fewer houses than expected last month. That is a warning sign the housing market could disappoint next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes declined 6.1% from the month before, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. Economists had forecast a decline just 1.1%. This appears to have confirmed housing market softness indicated by last week's weaker-than-expected report on November housing starts. That showed a decline of 7% compared with November of the prior year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales plunge was striking because the housing market had a lot of support from the broader economy in November. Mortgage interest rates were at very low levels. Consumer confidence rose. The stock market climbed sharply and consistently. Job creation was strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another reason economists were caught off guard by Monday's existing-homes sales report is that earlier indicators hadn't pointed to such a slump. For example, pending home sales, which tend to predict closings measured in the existing sales data, declined just 1.1% in October on a month-to-month basis and were flat in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are correlated with sales volume, although the precise mechanism for the correlation is debatable. One possible explanation is that declining volume means there is less liquidity in the market, and this puts downward pressure on prices. So far, prices are holding up, with the median sales price for existing homes up 5% from a year earlier, according to the NAR. That pace of appreciation is unlikely to hold if sales volume continues to drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The longer "For Sale" signs sit in the yard, the more likely sellers are to consider offering lower prices.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anya Martin   </div><div>859 words</div><div>19 December 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M5</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When deciding who gets a home loan and who doesn't, lenders heavily rely on one number: the loan-to-value ratio, or the LTV.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This stat weighs the loan amount relative to the value of the property being purchased. Most lenders require an LTV ratio of 80% or lower for jumbo mortgages -- loans that exceed $417,000 in most areas and $625,500 in some high-price places. A borrower seeking a $1 million loan for a house listed for $1.2 million would have an LTV of 83%, exceeding the 80% lender threshold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Complicating this formula in today's marketplace, however, is the "value" part of the LTV. An uneven recovery in some areas is leading to some appraisal-related challenges for borrowers. High-end homes with unique or custom features can be difficult to appraise. Similarly, a luxury home located in a less affluent area may also get a skewed appraisal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If an appraisal comes in low, a borrower will need to come up with a higher down payment to improve the LTV, or in some cases pay a higher interest rate, says Mathew Carson, a broker with San Francisco-based First Capital Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He cites the case of one of his clients who was trying to refinance his mortgage. One appraiser valued his home at $2 million in July. But when the client switched lenders, another appraiser valued the same home at just $1.4 million in October. That difference increased the LTV enough to raise the interest rate by a quarter point on a seven-year, adjustable-rate mortgage, so the borrower plans to file a rebuttal with the appraisal management company, Mr. Carson says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Appraisal discrepancies are more likely to occur with refinances than with new home purchases, he explains. By law, the lender in a refinance can't tell the appraiser the loan amount sought, whereas in a home purchase, the appraiser knows the purchase price and is likely to seek out comparable nearby homes in that range, Mr. Carson says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another complication: Some lenders require two appraisals for luxury homes. And when the appraisers' valuations differ, the lender will use the lower amount. Luxury-home appraisals can also take longer, meaning not only more waiting and uncertainty for a seller but also that a borrower locked-in on an interest rate can lose it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In competitive, high-end markets, appraisal-related delays could scuttle a deal. Peter J. Goodman, a broker with VA Loan Captain Realty, recently had a seller in Brooklyn, N.Y., accept an $825,000 all-cash offer over two separate mortgage-backed borrowers who bid $850,000 and $875,000. Because the property had been listed at $815,000, the seller was worried the appraisal would come in low and the mortgages would fall through, Mr. Goodman says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To compete against cash offers, buyers may decide to waive the mortgage contingency or a seller won't consider their offer, Mr. Goodman says. But they're playing a real-estate version of Russian roulette. Waiving the mortgage contingency clause means that the buyer agrees to the home purchase even if there are problems with loan approval due to an appraisal or another reason, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, the real-estate market has been improving at the high end, giving appraisers more comparable sales to consider when evaluating a home, says Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors (NAR). Sales of existing homes priced from $750,000 to $1 million-plus represented just over 2.1% of the real-estate market in October, compared with 1.7% of the market in October 2012, NAR data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The stock market is at a 12-year high, and when the stock market booms, the upper-end market for home sales begins to pick up," Mr. Yun says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low appraisals are rare for <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>'s jumbo mortgages compared with two years ago, says John Schleck, senior vice president, centralized sales executive for <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>. "With rates this low and values pretty stable, it may be a good time for a borrower to step in before values go higher," he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If an appraisal does come in lower than expected, here are a few tactics a borrower can try:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Higher LTV jumbos. More lenders, including <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> and <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>, are offering jumbo mortgages at 85% loan-to-value ratio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Inform the appraiser. While federal regulations forbid lenders from interacting directly with an appraiser, a refinancing homeowner can drop the needed loan amount into conversation during an appraiser visit, Mr. Carson says. Real-estate agents also can provide information about a property to the appraiser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Rebuttal. A last recourse is for the lender to file a rebuttal to the appraisal- management company, pointing out errors and suggesting alternate comparables. However, these rarely result in an amended appraisal, Mr. Carson says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home building faltered in November, a reminder of the headwinds that persist even as the broader housing market has shown new signs of strength in the final stretch of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall housing starts -- including apartments and other multifamily dwellings -- fell 1.6% in November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.028 million units but have held above the one million mark for three consecutive months, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within that total, construction of new single-family homes fell in November to an annual rate of 677,000 after surging to a postrecession high in October. Single-family homes account for the bulk of the market, and they generate more employment and make a bigger contribution to broader economic output.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, a fast-improving job market and easing mortgage rates are raising hopes that the housing recovery could gain momentum in the new year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We believe that it will be only a matter of time before the housing recovery shifts up a gear or two and provides a crucial second wind to the economic recovery," said Millan Mulraine, deputy head of U.S. research and strategy at <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wall Street Journal's latest monthly survey of economists found that forecasters expect home builders to break ground on 1.22 million homes in 2015, up 16% from 2014. The additional housing investment would help gross-domestic-product growth accelerate to a forecast 2.9% next year from expected growth of 2.2% this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But hopes for a housing surge this year were dashed when an unusually harsh winter further dented a recovery already suffering from a 2013 run-up in interest rates. The recovery started to get back on track with the arrival of warmer weather in the spring. But November housing permits, a leading indicator of construction, fell 5.2% to 1.035 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking ahead to 2015, the sector faces other headwinds. Mortgage-lending standards remain tight in the wake of the recession, with lower-rated borrowers having difficulty getting home loans. Also, steady gains in prices have put new homes out of reach for many despite a recent easing in mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With mortgage credit conditions remaining very tight and housing affordability somewhat challenged for first-time home buyers, all net new household formations are continuing to go into rentals," said Ted Wieseman, an economist at <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department's tally of new-home sales has been running below new-home starts. Sales inched up 0.7% in October. For the first 10 months of the year, they were up 1% from the same period last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, many economists and builders are optimistic the improvement in the broader economy soon will translate into increased demand for new housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy expanded at its fastest pace in more than a decade during the spring and summer, while job creation this year is on track to post its strongest run since 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>' index of builder confidence declined slightly in December but has held above the 50-point threshold -- the level that indicates a majority of builders see conditions as generally positive -- for six straight months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're going into next year anticipating a resurgence in our construction activity," said Rick Lafferty, president and chief executive of California home builder Lafferty Communities Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business has been somewhat softer in recent months for the company, but Mr. Lafferty is counting on a lift from a generally improving economy. "We have some projects that we feel are going to be ready for some additional phases, and we're opening new projects," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Southeast, JW Homes LLC's <span class="companylink">John Wieland Homes and Neighborhoods</span> already is feeling the boost. Greg Huff, chief executive of the Smyrna, Ga., company, said his starts for the 12 months ended in November were up 15% from the previous year, while his sales rose from 16% to 17%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a steady increase, which feels good, feels normal," Mr. Huff said. "We are cautiously optimistic about the spring of 2015."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Abenomics Wins Second Wind in Vote</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Voters handed Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe another chance to revive Japan's economy on Sunday. If he squanders the opportunity, investors won't be granting him a third.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ruling Liberal Democratic Party won a snap election in convincing fashion, a public endorsement of Mr. Abe's reflationary agenda. The most immediate impact will be a delay to a second consumption-tax increase, originally slated for October of this year, to April 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pushing back the tax hike will allow workers to enjoy the benefits of rising wages, which are going up, but not rapidly enough to overcome the effects of an initial consumption-tax increase that went into effect in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Abe's promise to cut the corporate tax rate to less than 30% from an effective rate of around 36% should directly boost corporate earnings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond that, however, investors are right to be skeptical about Mr. Abe's mandate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower taxes are popular, but other needed reforms aren't. The LDP has in the past pledged to change "be 2drock" regulations in labor, agriculture, health care and energy. But Mr. Abe didn't campaign on these themes. On the stump, he hardly mentioned the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a proposed free-trade pact with the U.S. and Pacific Rim nations. Many in Mr. Abe's own party, which relies on rural areas for support, fear exposing farmers to global competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Freer trade and more flexible domestic markets are essential to boosting Japan's long-term growth rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without these steps, there is little to Abenomics besides printing money and weakening the yen. While that combination has worked well for Japanese stocks, up more than 80% since Mr. Abe's 2012 election, investors also want proof that fixes are coming on underlying structural issues in the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Abe now has up to four more years in power, but few investors are so patient. Unless he quickly signals resolve on big-ticket changes, any postelection market euphoria could be short-lived.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's 'New Normal' Is Dose of Reality</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S., the "new normal" is about predicting a future of slow growth. In China, it is about acknowledging the reality of today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's leaders emerged from an annual economic work conference last week with the buzzwords "new normal" plastered on official news reports. It is meant to signal China is comfortable with what it calls "medium-to-high" economic growth, as opposed to the "high speed" growth of the past. That China's economy now sounds like a toaster-oven setting shouldn't bother investors too much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's slowdown has been clear for some time. The latest government data out last week show it isn't getting better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial production growth fell in November and will likely finish the year as the slowest in decades. Last month's imports were weak, signaling both low commodity prices and downbeat domestic activity. Consumer inflation at 1.4% is the lowest in five years, dragged down by cheap oil and falling housing prices. And oil could act as a continued drag.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property market, around which one-third of economic activity revolves, has yet to respond strongly to stimulus measures. The decline in residential property sales worsened again last month, falling 7.9% year over year, after showing signs of stabilizing in recent months. Inventories of unsold apartments increased 28% in November versus a year earlier, just slightly slower than October's pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By lowering expectations, Beijing is giving itself room to maneuver. Stimulus measures so far have been aimed at relieving stress in the financial system and property market, rather than broad moves to boost overall growth. Another dose of temporary liquidity into the banking system last week is evidence of that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Talk of a new normal is a clear sign authorities will remain judicious about doling out bigger moves. While another interest-rate cut or changes to bank reserve-requirement ratios seem likely, they also will be limited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is good for efforts to wring out bad debts that have built up in the economy. But it is ominous for the margin lending-fueled stock market mania under way in Shanghai. The market overall has tended to track availability of credit. Overall lending rose in November but remains subdued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Behind closed doors, China's leaders likely came to consensus last week on lowering the totemic GDP growth target next year, from the current 7.5%. Official word likely won't come until the National People's <span class="companylink">Congress</span> next March. Either way, the new normal shouldn't be hard to get used to. It's already here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Alex Frangos</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forecasts for</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inflation Will</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drown in Oil</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The oil-market rout could have a much more powerful influence on prices and spending than economists are letting on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slide in energy prices has led economists to revise their forecasts. With regular gasoline averaging $2.60 a gallon, and set to fall further, they see inflation cooling in the months ahead. And since cheaper fuel frees up income, they have got consumer spending going up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But knowing how quickly prices can shift, economists can be a little cautious about how much they change their forecasts. Consider the Labor Department's consumer-price index. Economists estimate that inflation will be 1.4% in the fourth quarter, and then soften to a bit less than 1% in the first quarter of 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it could cool a lot more. Evercore ISI estimates that futures now point to gasoline at $2.31 in January, down 30% year over year. Assume it stays there through the first quarter, and that gets reflected in the Labor Department's index of consumer energy commodities, which is 93% gasoline. Assume, also, that prices for energy services like electricity merely stay flat with their October level. And have food, and other consumer goods and services change at the same year-over-year rates as they did in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result: The CPI will rise about 0.2% in January and 0.1% in February -- and slip 0.3% in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Barbera, co-director for the Center for Financial Economics at <span class="companylink">Johns Hopkins University</span>, thinks economists are underestimating gasoline's effect on consumer spending, and that they will be even more surprised by the strength of the December retail sales report than they were by last week's November report. Investors relying on economists' estimates could be pretty surprised, as well.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, allegations that appraisers both overvalue and undervalue homes are nothing new ("Dodgy Home Appraisals Are Making a Comeback," page one, Dec. 2). Appraisers are frequently an easy target because they are often the only party to the real-estate transaction with no "skin in the game." Appraisers complying with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, the generally accepted standards of the appraisal profession in the U.S., are required to be independent, impartial and objective. Other parties to the transaction often have sizable commissions at stake, which are paid only upon consummation of a sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An appraisal completed by a licensed or certified appraiser required by law to comply with USPAP, remains the most credible valuation method available. Appraisals neither set the value of a home nor confirm a home's sale price. Instead, they are intended to reflect the market value of a property, which isn't always the sale price. In many cases, credible appraisals protect buyers from overpaying for homes and help lenders make prudent loan decisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If undue influence is being exerted on appraisers, or unethical activity is suspected by any party, there are checks and balances in place for protection. Formal complaints should be filed with the applicable state appraiser regulatory agency or through the Appraisal Subcommittee's Appraisal Complaint National Hotline at www.asc.gov[http://www.asc.gov].</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a real-estate agent for over 35 years, I offer two simple reasons for poor appraisal work. First, you get what you pay for. The marketplace has hammered down appraisal fees so much that quality work, in many cases, isn't possible. Many residential and commercial real-estate appraisers I know now work from home and have seen appraisal fees reduced by more than 50% in the past 15 years. In a perfect world, an appraiser wouldn't agree to take a job if the fee won't compensate him or her enough to conduct the research necessary to arrive at an accurate value. But some are forced to choose between doing the right thing or paying their bills. Second, extremely poor or unethical appraisal work is rarely reported. In my opinion, the simple threat of reporting the small minority of appraisers who do poor or unethical work, which could lead to a loss of their licenses, would clean up both the financial and real-estate industries more than any federal regulation currently in place.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Alex Frangos   </div><div>461 words</div><div>13 December 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B14</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S., the "new normal" is about predicting a future of slow growth. In China, it is about acknowledging the reality of today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's leaders emerged from an annual economic work conference this week with the buzzwords "new normal" plastered on official news reports. It is meant to signal China is comfortable with what it calls "medium-to-high" economic growth, as opposed to the "high speed" growth of the past. That China's economy now sounds like a toaster-oven setting, shouldn't bother investors too much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's slowdown has been clear for some time. The latest government data out this week show it isn't getting better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial production growth fell in November and will likely finish the year as the slowest in decades. Last month's imports were weak, signaling both low commodity prices and downbeat domestic activity. Consumer inflation at 1.4% is the lowest in five years, dragged down by cheap oil and falling housing prices. And oil could act as a continued drag.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property market, around which a third of economic activity revolves, has yet to respond strongly to stimulus measures. The decline in residential property sales worsened again last month, falling 7.9% year-over-year, after showing signs of stabilizing in recent months. Inventories of unsold apartments increased 28% in November versus a year earlier, just slightly slower than October's pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By lowering expectations, Beijing is giving itself room to maneuver. Stimulus measures so far have been aimed at relieving stress in the financial system and property market, rather than broad moves to boost overall growth. Another dose of temporary liquidity into the banking system this week is evidence of that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Talk of a new normal is a clear sign authorities will remain judicious about doling out bigger moves. While another interest-rate cut or changes to bank reserve-requirement ratios seem likely, they also will be limited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is good for efforts to wring out bad debts that have built up in the economy. But it is ominous for the margin lending-fueled stock market mania under way in Shanghai. The market overall has tended to track availability of credit. Overall lending rose in November but remains subdued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Behind closed doors, China's leaders likely came to consensus this week on lowering the totemic GDP growth target next year, from the current 7.5%. Official word likely won't come until the National People's <span class="companylink">Congress</span> next March. Either way, the new normal shouldn't be hard to get used to. It's already here.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House prices in Australia and Canada have outperformed those in the U.S. and U.K. over the last 10 years, with gains in housing hot spots such as London and New York beaten by lesser-known names Darwin and Winnipeg, according to a study by Toronto-based rating agency DBRS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study compared house prices in 50 cities in the U.K., U.S., Canada and Australia, charted in benchmarks that took into account local factors such as inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada and Australia held the top 12 spots in the 50-city list, according to the study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The northern Australian city of Darwin had a cumulative average annual rate of return of 9.6%, and Canada’s Winnipeg grew 8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Darwin benefited from its status as a trading gateway to Southeast Asia and from nearby offshore petroleum activity, DBRS said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing markets in Australia and Canada fared well through the financial crisis with only minor corrections that lasted a few months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study comes at a time of renewed worries about the stability of Canada’s housing market. The Bank of Canada said Wednesday[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/canadas-central-bank-says-housing-prices-debt-pose-threat-to-stability-1418232017] that high housing prices and near-record levels of household debt constitute a “significant” risk to financial stability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the “U.S. peaked in July 2006 and has yet to recover,” it says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strongest U.S. performance was from Portland, Ore., which ranked 21st with a return of 2.8%. The U.K.’s top performer was London, in the 13th spot with a 5.1% annual return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The worst performer among cities charted was Las Vegas, where house prices, measured against the benchmark, dropped more than 60% from peak to trough during the recession. DBRS said four factors were behind the city’s poor performance: overbuilding, speculative investment, subprime foreclosures and a weak economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DBRS said different government policies have played a key role in the divergence between the four markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Since the financial crisis, the United States government has tightened regulations on banks and other financial institutions, making it more difficult for people to qualify for new mortgages,” it says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In contrast, more conservative lending practices in Canada, and Australia somewhat sheltered these countries’ housing markets from a severe correction,” DBRS says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing markets in all four countries face potential corrections if interest rates rise. The way those corrections unfold is likely to vary significantly at the international level, and also between cities in the same country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study draws on data drawn from <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor’s</span> Case-Shiller Index in the U.S., the <span class="companylink">Australian Bureau of Statistics</span>, the <span class="companylink">National Bank of Canada</span>/ Teranet index in Canada, and the U.K. Land Registry and Registers of Scotland.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Chelsey Dulaney   </div><div>396 words</div><div>10 December 2014</div><div>06:39</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Toll Brothers Inc</span>. posted a 39% surge in fiscal fourth-quarter earnings, as the luxury home builder begins to see the benefits of a slowly recovering housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As the housing market progresses through the early stages of what we believe will be an extended and uneven recovery, we are pleased to report significant progress in growing our revenues and profits,” Toll Brothers Chief Executive Douglas C. Yearley Jr. said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recovery in the housing market has remained tepid this year, despite initial expectations that it would help boost the overall economy. While sales of previously owned homes have rebounded after a weak start to the year, new-home sales are barely trending above last year’s soft levels, and home construction has been flat despite historically low interest rates and a healing labor market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span>, with its higher-end offerings, has benefited from lower interest rates to post relatively strong results amid the housing market’s lackluster performance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the quarter ended Oct. 31, posted a profit $131.5 million, or 71 cents a share, compared with a profit of $94.9 million, or 53 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected a per-share profit of 73 cents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll in November had reported a preliminary[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/toll-brothers-revenue-rises-29-on-west-coast-demand-1415623523] 29% jump in revenue, lifted by higher average home prices and strong demand in its West Coast division.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company’s pretax income was $188.5 million for the quarter, up from $150.2 million a year earlier, while its margin edged up to 25.5% from 25.4% a year earlier, excluding interest and write-downs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll said it expects results for the new fiscal year will be similar to the year that ended in October. Toll expects to deliver between 5,000 and 6,000 homes at an average price of $710,000 to $760,000. In its October quarter, the average price of homes delivered was $747,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home builder also said it expects to benefit in 2016 from a fragmented luxury market, pent-up demand and underproduction.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Peter Grant   </div><div>720 words</div><div>8 December 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A24</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Newmark Grubb Knight Frank</span>, known mostly for its strength in the commercial real estate leasing market, is about to become a bigger force in the sales world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newmark's parent company, <span class="companylink">BGC Partners Inc</span>., is acquiring Apartment Realty Advisors, one of the largest brokers of apartment buildings in the U.S., for about $110 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal is the latest sign of BGC's effort to use its strong balance sheet to add muscle to New York-based Newmark and build it into one of the world's largest real-estate services firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BGC, a spinoff of <span class="companylink">Cantor Fitzgerald</span>, also is buying Apartment Realty as the apartment-building market is booming. Values have been rising, along with rents and occupancies, during much of the downturn as living patterns have shifted in the U.S. and more people are opting to rent rather than own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department's report on Friday showed November was the strongest month of hiring since January 2012, providing another positive sign. The market is robust, said Barry Gosin, Newmark's chief executive. "People may not buy a home. But they'll rent."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartment Realty, which sold properties worth more than $10 billion in 2013, is a network of brokerage firms in 28 cities with about 15 different owners that share information, contacts and technology. BGC is essentially buying all those separate firms and putting them all under Newmark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal was complicated for Mr. Gosin and James Kuhn, Newmark's president, to pull off because it involved numerous transactions. Mr. Gosin said it helped that Newmark's Denver operation, which Newmark acquired in 2013, has owned a large stake in the Denver office in the Apartment Realty network.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was kind of like living together before we got married," Mr. Gosin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartment Realty executives say they like the deal because BGC and Newmark have the capital markets expertise that buyers and sellers increasingly are demanding. Newmark also has operations throughout the world and will be able to extend the global reach of owners wanting to sell or refinance properties through Apartment Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BGC and Newmark have a "heavy New York-centric capital markets expertise," said Blake Okland, chairman of ARA's executive committee. "We're happy to bolt on to that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commercial real estate business has seen an increasing number of mergers and acquisitions as firms have recognized the importance of scale. The price BGC is paying for Apartment Realty might rise beyond the $110 million if certain performance targets are met.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newmark has been one of the world's fastest-growing commercial real estate firms since it was bought by BGC in 2011. Other acquisitions have included the assets of <span class="companylink">Grubb &amp; Ellis Co</span>. in 2012 and Cornish &amp; Carey Commercial this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newmark had $655 million in revenue for the 12 months that ended Sept. 30. Mr. Gosin said he hopes the firm's revenue will reach $1 billion in 2015, when the figure will include the recent Cornish &amp; Carey and Apartment Realty acquisitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newmark already is active in the sales market in a few regions, particularly New York, focusing on buildings valued at $50 million and less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying Apartment Realty will greatly expand Newmark's contacts with the leading pension funds, private-equity firms and other institutional buyers of apartment buildings. Those same institutions are also active buyers of other types of commercial property, which could help Newmark's other sales businesses, Mr. Gosin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The risk in BGC's deal for Apartment Realty lies in a cooling off in the so-called multifamily market. Analysts say this could happen if the economy takes a turn for the worse or if home sales take off and the U.S. shifts back to more of a nation of owners rather than renters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But such warnings have been around for more than two years and the apartment rental market has kept chugging. Rents have risen nationally for 23 straight quarters and are 15.2% higher than they were at the end of the recession in 2009, according to <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Multifamily transaction volume should continue to be robust," said Dave Bragg, a Green Street Advisors analyst, in an email.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Eliot Brown and Art Patnaude   </div><div>714 words</div><div>8 December 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>27</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luxury-home prices in 33 major cities around the world -- from Los Angeles to Monaco -- are up 36% since 2009, according to data from real-estate firm Knight Frank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The taxman has noticed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To bolster public coffers or to curb rampant growth, a number of cities, including Singapore, Hong Kong and San Francisco, have imposed or increased taxes on wealthy home buyers in recent years. In other major cities, such as New York, London and Paris, new taxes on high-end homes and second homes are on the table.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists and real estate professionals are studying the effect of so-called mansion taxes on the property market, and so far their findings are mixed. Hong Kong, for example, levied a tax on foreign investors in 2012 and increased a transfer tax on expensive homes in 2013. Since then, transaction volume has fallen to about 8,000 home sales a month from more than 12,000 in 2011, according to research firm Colliers International. But home prices have proven resilient. While they initially fell about 5%, they have bounced back to record levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taxing the rich via their property is hardly a new concept. In 17th-century England, King William III taxed property owners based on the number of windows in their houses, since the wealthy tended to have larger homes with more windows. The market reacted: To avoid the tax, builders included fewer and fewer windows -- and some houses had rooms without windows at all, according to a paper published in April by the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the modern era, such taxes have been relatively infrequent, with governments preferring annual taxes based on assessed value. In Germany and Finland, for example, wealth taxes were largely abandoned in the past two decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In implementing a mansion tax, the methods vary, as do the rationales. Both Hong Kong and Singapore increased taxes on foreign investors buying property to intentionally deflate prices in a real estate bubble created by a flood of purchases by Chinese investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.K., a proposed mansion tax stands to be a focal point of the national election in May. The Labour Party, vying for power against the current Conservative-led coalition government, has vowed to introduce a levy on homes worth above GBP 2 million, or about $3.1 million, in an appeal to working-class voters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many high-end brokers and would-be buyers say that the tax would stifle the market. Notably, Angelina Jolie, visiting to promote a new film last month, said in a televised interview that a mansion tax could affect her decision-making. "I'm quite reasonable about money," Ms. Jolie said. "That could put me off."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics say the mansion tax would have the greatest impact on buyers within the U.K. "For ultrahigh net worth individuals who can buy anywhere in the world, it's not going to stop them," said Shirley Humphrey, director at <span class="companylink">Harrods Estates</span>, the estate-agency arm of the luxury department store in London. "It would have more of an effect on the local U.K. market. For instance, it could stop people from moving up to that next property on the ladder," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists, meanwhile, generally believe such taxes are a blunt instrument and say that similar goals can be achieved by income taxes or increasing property taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wojciech Kopczuk, an economist at New York's Columbia University who has studied mansion taxes, said the transfer taxes that have been proposed and implemented are "distortive," causing some sellers to rethink a sale at all and thus slowing down the market. "Transaction taxes stop people from trading," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Kopczuk said, depending on the motivations of those implementing the tax, such measures tend to be effective in redistributing some wealth given that many rich homeowners often live and pay taxes elsewhere. "If I want to give them credit for the point of view of economics," he said, "these are people that you cannot otherwise tax with other forms of taxation."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home appraisers are inflating the values of some properties they assess, often at the behest of loan officers and real-estate agents, in what industry executives say is a return to practices seen before the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An estimated one in seven appraisals conducted from 2011 through early 2014 inflated home values by 20% or more, according to data provided to The Wall Street Journal by Digital Risk Analytics, a subsidiary of <span class="companylink">Digital Risk LLC</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mortgage-analysis and consulting firm based in Maitland, Fla., was hired by some of the 20 largest lenders to review their loan files.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm reviewed more than 200,000 mortgages, parsing the homes' appraised values and other information, including the properties' sizes and similar homes sold in the areas at the times. The review was conducted using the firm's software and staff appraisers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bankers, appraisers and federal officials in interviews said inflated appraisals are becoming more widespread as the recovery in the housing market cools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While home prices are increasing generally, their appreciation is slowing, and sales have been weak despite low interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar amount of new mortgages issued this year is expected to be down 39% from last year, at about $1.12 trillion, according to the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has put increasing pressure on loan officers, who depend on originating new mortgages for their income, as well as real-estate agents, who live on sales commissions. That in turn is raising the heat on appraisers, whose valuations can make or break a sale. Banks generally won't agree to a mortgage if the purchase price or the refinancing amount is higher than the appraised value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The practice is garnering broader notice. The <span class="companylink">Office of the Comptroller of the Currency</span> is reviewing the mortgages banks are doling out, concerned that some of them are based on inflated values, according to Darrin Benhart, a deputy comptroller who focuses on identifying areas of risk in the federal banking system. The OCC oversees national bank and federal savings associations lending practices. Separately, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the mortgage-finance giant, said it has opened fraud investigations related to appraisals of homes backing mortgages it bought.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost 40% of appraisers surveyed from Sept. 15 through Nov. 7 reported experiencing pressure to inflate values, according to Allterra Group LLC, a for-profit appraiser-advocacy firm based in Salisbury, Md. That figure was 37% in the survey for the previous year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you thought what was happening before was an embarrassment, wait until the second time around," said Joan Trice, Allterra's chief executive and founder of the Collateral Risk Network, which represents appraisers employed by lenders and other companies and has been meeting with regulators to discuss concerns about appraisers being pressured into inflating values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To determine a home's value, appraisers assess a property's condition, size and location, among other factors. They use similar properties that have been recently sold as one key basis for comparison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Digital Risk found that some appraised values were off the mark based on discrepancies that appeared unintentional, though, "at other times, the appraiser's selection of [comparable properties] . . . is very hard to justify," said Thomas Showalter, chief analytics officer at Digital Risk. The firm saw cases where values for decades-old homes were determined based on sales prices for newly constructed ones, and homes blocks from shorelines were compared with waterfront properties, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, inflated appraisals aren't a problem everywhere. Real-estate agents, for example, say they sometimes encounter appraisals that come in below the agreed-upon purchase price and derail the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twenty-four percent of real-estate agents surveyed in March 2014 reported that low appraisals resulted in sales contracts being canceled, delayed or negotiated to a lower price, according to the latest data from the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. But that figure has been declining in recent years: In March 2013, 29% of agents reported such problems, and the figure was 31% in March 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brandon Boudreau, chief operating officer at <span class="companylink">Metro-West Appraisal Co. LLC</span>, a national firm based in Detroit, says he and his appraisers often feel pressured by aggressive real-estate agents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a daily thing," Mr. Boudreau says. "They say, 'Your appraiser is incompetent. They don't know what they're doing.'" In such instances, Mr. Boudreau says he tells the real-estate agents to contact the loan officer handling the borrower's application with evidence the appraiser undervalued the home.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retail spending over the U.S. Thanksgiving weekend fell 11%, according to the main industry trade group, a sign that the annual four-day shopping bonanza may be losing some of its punch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline, the second annual drop in a row, came in part because retailers started offering deals in the days and even weeks before, giving U.S. shoppers ample opportunities to snag discounts without having to endure the lines and crowds that typify Black Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Target Corp</span>., for instance, offered its first round of so-called Black Friday deals on Nov. 10, while <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart Stores Inc</span>. kicked off its holiday promotions at the start of the month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total spending from Thursday through Sunday sank 11% from a year earlier to $50.9 billion, according to the <span class="companylink">National Retail Federation</span>, which surveyed 4,600 consumers on Friday and Saturday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shoppers spent an average of $380.95, down 6.4% from a year earlier. The trade group still expects total holiday sales through the end of the year to rise 4.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shoppers "don't feel like they have to get out that one day or miss spending the holidays with their families," said Elissa Margolis, senior vice president for <span class="companylink">Disney</span> Store North America at <span class="companylink">Walt Disney Co</span>. The company, which operates more than 200 <span class="companylink">Disney</span> stores in North America, began offering promotions on items like dolls and costumes from the "Frozen" and "Star Wars" movies online and in its stores on the Monday before Thanksgiving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, brick-and-mortar retailers have stepped up their Web offerings with more promotions like free shipping, rolling sales through the month and price-matching online rivals such as <span class="companylink">Amazon.com Inc</span>. The more robust Web selection and discounts have allowed shoppers to take advantage of Black Friday discounts without interrupting time at home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The retail trade group said the number of people who went shopping over the four-day weekend declined 5.2% from last year to 134 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weak results contrast with improvements elsewhere in the economy, such as decreasing joblessness, a rebounding housing market and two quarters of strong economic growth, and they suggest that even with an economy on the mend many consumers remain thrifty five years after the recession. Consumers have become much more dutiful about researching their purchases on the Web to find the best price and have also become more disciplined, limiting their impulse buys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barbara Holmes, a 37-year-old pharmacy technician from Trenton, N.J., went to <span class="companylink">RadioShack</span> in Morrisville, Pa., to buy her daughter a new LG phone priced at $39.99. She went only for the one deal and planned to shop online for other needs, like clothing. Ms. Holmes shopped at <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span> last year but was skipping the crowds and long lines this year. "I ain't going up there with all the crazy people," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales drop this weekend could sting retailers, which had been generating a 10th of their holiday sales over that weekend, but it doesn't mean retailers are going to give up the annual shopping ritual anytime soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Finishing Thanksgiving dinner and offering sales is like ringing the bell that alerts people it's gift-giving season, and that will always be the case," said Steve Davis, CEO of Rue La La, a fashion discounter that is majority owned by Kynetic LLC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For others, it's a matter of staying in the game alongside the big retailers that spend heavily on promotions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's really important for us to stay out there at all times to drive business, even if that means starting the sales earlier and earlier," said Jon Abt, co-president of <span class="companylink">Abt Electronics</span> &amp; Appliances in Glenview, Ill., which takes in a quarter of its sales online. Sales over Thursday, Friday and Saturday rose 40% online and 20% in the store from the year before, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many retailers offered the same discounts on the Web as they offered in stores. The Internet didn't attract more shoppers or more spending than last year, according to <span class="companylink">NRF</span>'s closely watched survey. Online shopping accounted for 42% of spending over the four-day period, down from 44% last year, the trade group said, with the average amount consumers spent online declining 10% from a year ago to $159.55.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey, conducted by a third party Friday and Saturday, polled 4,631 consumers. Other forecasters came up with slightly different results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">ShopperTrak</span>, which monitors shopper visits at tens of thousands of brick-and-mortar sites, said sales over Thursday and Friday slipped 0.5%. Data from <span class="companylink">International Business Machines Corp</span>., based on its survey of online transactions at 800 retail websites, showed online sales rose more slowly on Thanksgiving and Black Friday than they did last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Holiday-shopping figures often differ as forecasters use different methodologies to collect different sets of data.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Eric Morath   </div><div>450 words</div><div>28 November 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market was supposed to give the economy a big boost this year. It isn't turning out that way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While sales of previously owned homes have rebounded after a weak start to the year, new-home sales are barely trending above last year's levels and home construction has been flat despite low interest rates and a healing labor market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gross domestic product expanded 2.4% in the third quarter from a year earlier, driven largely by better consumer and business spending. Residential investment, though, a measure of home building and improvements, was down 0.8% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Consumers continue to face many of the same lingering barriers, including minimal income growth, difficulty accessing credit and dilapidated savings," said Sterne Agee economist Lindsey Piegza. Those factors restrict "consumers' ability to purchase large-ticket items such as a new home."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new single-family homes rose only slightly in October after the three previous months of data were revised lower, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. October's seasonally adjusted annual pace of 458,000 remained just below a postrecession peak reached in June 2013 and is roughly half the average annual level recorded from 1996 through 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first 10 months, sales rose 1% from the same period in 2013. New homes represent only about 10% of all sales, but construction adds more jobs and investment into the economy compared with purchasing a previously owned house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising prices are putting new homes out of reach for some buyers. In October, the median price for a new home rose 15% from a year earlier to $305,000, the highest level on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">David Weekley Homes</span> Chief Executive John Johnson said further improvements in the economy and consumer confidence are needed. "I think we saw a little price resistance from the consumer," he said. "There are a bunch of people who are waiting until they feel more confident."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unemployment rate sank to the lowest level since 2008 last month, and the average interest rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage hovers near 4%. But mortgages remain difficult for many Americans to obtain, and there is relatively weak demand for single-family houses among younger adults.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Millennials are still at the stage of moving out of their parents' homes and renting, and those who lost homes in foreclosures still can't qualify for credit," said Jed Kolko, economist for the real-estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>. "I'd be surprised if we saw a dramatic improvement in the next year."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Saumya Vaishampayan   </div><div>808 words</div><div>26 November 2014</div><div>16:54</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Dow</span> industrials and S&amp;P 500 ended at record levels Wednesday in a quiet, preholiday trading session.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 12.81 points, or 0.1%, to 17827.75. The blue-chip index pushed into positive territory in the last hour of trading, notching its 30th record close for the year. The S&amp;P 500 index gained 5.8 points, or 0.3%, to 2072.83, marking its 47th closing high in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 29.07 points, or 0.6%, to 4787.32. The U.S. stock market will be closed Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While several economic reports missed expectations, investors said they were still consistent with an economic recovery in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Improving U.S. economic data and upbeat corporate earnings have helped propel U.S. stocks to a series of record highs in recent weeks. Data released this week showed the U.S. economy grew at a pace of 3.9% in the third quarter, higher than the initial estimate of 3.5%. The growth rate in the second and third quarters combined marked the best six-month pace since the second half of 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The U.S. economy is progressing nicely,” said Burt White, chief investment officer at broker-dealer LPL Financial. “We don’t see the data today derailing that view.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors looked ahead to a Thursday meeting of the <span class="companylink">Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries</span>, which takes place amid a backdrop of sharply lower oil prices. Saudi Arabia’s oil minister on Wednesday hinted he wouldn’t push for a cut in <span class="companylink">OPEC</span>’s production targets. Poorer countries have advocated for production cuts to boost oil prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crude-oil futures fell 0.5% to $73.69 a barrel. In other commodity markets, gold futures fell less than 0.1% to $1,196.60 an ounce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deep-water drilling companies fell the most on the <span class="companylink">S&amp;P</span>. <span class="companylink">Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc</span>. shares slumped 11% and those of <span class="companylink">Transocean Ltd</span>. fell 8.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While lower oil prices will hit shares of energy companies, many investors say the slide in oil could eventually boost consumer spending. That would spill over into increased earnings for U.S. companies, especially in the consumer discretionary space, and help lift stocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Consumer spending is key to drive the equity market higher,” said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. Robust consumer spending has yet to materialize, but Mr. Sandven said he’s watching for sales data from the Thanksgiving weekend to see if consumers are more willing to spend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday’s U.S. economic data included two weak readings on home sales. New home sales rose 0.7% in October to an annual rate of 458,000, the Commerce Department said. Economists in a Wall Street Journal survey had expected a pace of 470,000 last month. Separately, an index of pending sales of existing homes unexpectedly fell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The housing market continues to be the only question mark” in the U.S. recovery, said Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer of equities at <span class="companylink">Charles Schwab Investment Management</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jobless claims rose 21,000 to 313,000 in the week ended Nov. 22, the Labor Department said. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected 289,000 claims. Still, claims remain near postrecession lows, a sign that the labor market continues to recover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. consumer spending rose 0.2% in October from the prior month, slightly less than the 0.3% expected by economists. <span class="companylink">The Fed</span>’s preferred gauge of inflation, the price index for personal consumption expenditures, rose 0.1% and is up 1.4% from a year earlier. That is the 30th month in a row that inflation has stayed below the Fed’s 2% annual target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, orders for durable goods unexpectedly rose 0.4% in October from a month earlier. Orders were boosted by a rise in military spending that masked weak demand for other goods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Europe continues to struggle with dangerously low inflation and tepid growth. European Central Bank Vice President Vitor Constancio on Wednesday suggested the bank is ready to buy government bonds early next year if more-aggressive stimulus measures are needed. <span class="companylink">German government</span> bonds rose, nearing all-time highs, in the wake of the remarks. The Stoxx Europe 600 ended flat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.234%. Yields fall as prices rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In corporate news, <span class="companylink">Deere Co</span>. forecast a 20% decline in sales of farm equipment for the recently started business year. The gloomy projection overshadowed quarterly results that topped Wall Street’s expectations. Shares fell 0.9%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. stocks ended slightly higher in quiet, pre-holiday trading, with the <span class="companylink">Dow</span> and S&amp;P 500 setting new records, despite a batch of lackluster U.S. economic data. Treasurys got a boost from the soft numbers, while the dollar fell as investors booked profits. Oil prices finished at four-year lows after the Saudi oil minister hinted he wouldn’t push for a cut in <span class="companylink">OPEC</span>’s production targets. Gold settled flat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OPENING CALL</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">OPEC</span> will be in the spotlight Thursday. The <span class="companylink">Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries</span> is on the brink of a decision that could send oil prices up--or keep them depressed. While prices have been falling since midsummer, <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> has done nothing to intervene. Speculation has been rife as to why. A reduction of 1.5 million barrels a day is needed to tighten oil markets next year, according to oil analysts at <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>. After remarks from Saudi’s oil minister on Wednesday, John Kilduff, founding partner of Again Capital in New York, said he thinks “it’s pretty clear coming out of these meetings that there will not be a production cut.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, orders for durable goods unexpectedly rose 0.4% in October from a month earlier. Orders were boosted by a rise in military spending that masked weak demand for other goods.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar weakened against the yen and the euro after new data showing the U.S. economy is improving modestly underscored expectations the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> won’t raise interest rates until later next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. data showed inflation ticked up last month as consumer spending rose, weekly jobless claims picked up, and business investment weakened in October as military spending increased. Collectively, the numbers pointed to a U.S. economy that is gaining traction slowly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar weakened for a second straight session despite signs of rising inflation and increasing growth over the past two days, two elements the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> has said must precede higher interest rates. Expectations of higher U.S. rates and signs of looser monetary policy abroad have lifted the greenback against its rivals over the past few weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower consumer confidence and higher jobless claims, alongside the week’s Thanksgiving holiday and the coming month end, presented an opportunity for investors to close up some bets on a stronger dollar, said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at the currency brokerage <span class="companylink">Commonwealth Foreign Exchange Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The data were a good excuse to book some profits on the dollar’s rally over the last few weeks,” Mr. Esiner said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BONDS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">U.S. government</span> bonds strengthened for a fifth straight session as a string of disappointing U.S. economic releases boosted demand for haven assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. bond markets will be shut Thursday for Thanksgiving and will close early on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jobless claims rose to an 11-week high in the latest week, a setback for a labor market that has recently gained traction. Personal spending posted a smaller pace of increase than economists had forecast. Pending new home sales unexpectedly declined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Today’s data reflected a broad-based softening in the U.S. economy in the fourth quarter, after a relatively strong performance in the third quarter,” said James DeMasi, chief fixed-income strategist at <span class="companylink">Stifel Nicolaus</span> in Baltimore. “With economic momentum fading, inflation will likely continue to slip further away from the <span class="companylink">Fed</span>’s 2.0% target rate over the coming months, which will keep the <span class="companylink">Fed</span> from raising rates until late 2015 at the earliest.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. inflation remained below the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>’s annual 2% target for the 30th consecutive month in October, giving the central bank some breathing room in moving toward higher borrowing costs for the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price index for personal consumption expenditures, the <span class="companylink">Fed</span>’s preferred inflation measure, rose 0.1% from September and is up 1.4% from a year earlier, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A $29 billion sale of seven-year notes drew strong demand, wrapping up this week’s strong auctions of new <span class="companylink">U.S. government</span> debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new seven-year notes were sold at a yield of 1.96%, the lowest since October 2013. The auction drew $2.63 bids for each dollar offered, the highest since February. Indirect bidding, a proxy gauge of demand from foreign investors, jumped to 50%, the highest since 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bond market was also supported by month-end demand from fund managers. Some investors bought bonds Wednesday because they want to avoid thin liquidity on Friday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries</span> is gathering for its most closely watched meeting in years, and observers are growing pessimistic about the cartel making any big moves to stop the 30% slide in prices since the summer.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. consumer spending was muted and business investment weak in October, suggesting a mild slowdown in the last quarter of the year following two quarters of robust economic growth.

</div><div class="author">By Jonathan House   </div><div>578 words</div><div>26 November 2014</div><div>11:53</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—The number of contracts signed to buy previously owned homes fell in October, a new sign of an uneven housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An index of pending sales of existing homes, reflecting purchases under contract but not yet closed, fell 1.1% to 104.1 in October from September, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Wednesday. It was up 2.2% from the same period a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index has been inching higher this year and is above the 100 level the trade group defines as an average level of activity. But it has struggled to regain the postrecession highs it hit in mid-2013 before rising interest rates dented the housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the report provided “yet more evidence that the trend in housing-market activity is flat.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had forecast a 0.5% rise in October sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">News Corp</span>, owner of The Wall Street Journal, also owns <span class="companylink">Move Inc</span>., which operates a website and mobile products for the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales tallied for the pending-sales index typically close a month or two later. The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>’ closely watched barometer of existing-home sales, which measures sales after contracts close, rose 1.5% in October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.26 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was the highest level in a year for sales of existing homes, which account for around 90% of all transactions in the market. But October’s decline in the pending sales suggests the gauge of existing home sales will fall in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of newly built single-family homes[http://online.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/new-home-sales-rose-in-october-september-number-revised-down-1417014453?KEYWORDS=new home sales] in the U.S. inched 0.7% higher in October from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 458,000, according to a separate report from the Commerce Department Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales have largely disappointed this year. In the decade leading up to the recession, nearly 1 million new homes were sold on average annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steady job growth, slowing price gains and an increased supply of homes for sale have helped to support demand for housing. U.S. employers added 214,000 jobs to payrolls last month[http://online.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/jobs-report-economy-adds-214000-jobs-1415367269] and are on pace to post the best yearly gain in employment since 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates, which rose last year when the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> signaled it would start rolling back its easy money policies, have been easing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the week ended late Thursday, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 3.99%, according to data from <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. That was down from 4.01% a week earlier and 4.22% a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a steady run-up in prices means housing affordability has continued to deteriorate. The mortgage payment for a median-priced U.S. home rose to 16.3% of median household income in June, a six-year high, according to a recent report from the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing sector faces other headwinds including stagnant household incomes and banks that are still cautious about lending. “Demand is holding steady but would be more robust if it weren’t for lagging wage growth and tight credit conditions,” National Association of Realtors chief economist Lawrence Yun said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kathleen Madigan   </div><div>337 words</div><div>25 November 2014</div><div>09:06</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The yearly growth in home prices across the U.S. decelerated further in September, according to a home price report released Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home price index covering the entire nation increased 4.8% in the 12 months ended in September, said the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index report. That is down from 5.1% in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home price index covering 10 major U.S. cities increased 4.8% in the year ended in September. The 20-city price index was up 4.9%. That is down from 5.6% in August but slightly above the 4.8% expected by economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On an unadjusted basis, the 10-city and 20-city gauges were unchanged in September from August, while the national index slipped 0.1%. <span class="companylink">S&amp;P</span> said that was the first national decline since November 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seasonally adjusted, the U.S. index increased 0.7% in September, while the two city composites each rose 0.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowdown reflects the lackluster pace of home demand as buyers are constrained by stagnant pay growth and tight lending conditions as well as lingering financial problems for some households even years after the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The overall trend in home price increases continues to slow down,” said David M. Blitzer, Chairman of the Index Committee at <span class="companylink">S&amp;P</span><span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> Indices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Other housing statistics paint a mixed to slightly positive picture,” he said, pointing to increased housing starts and a reduced mortgage default rate. “With the economy looking better than a year ago, the housing outlook for 2015 is stable to slightly better.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regionally, Charlotte and Dallas were the only cities to see their annual gains accelerate while Cleveland remained virtually unchanged for the fourth consecutive month.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Min Zeng   </div><div>727 words</div><div>21 November 2014</div><div>15:32</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices of government bonds in the U.S. and Europe strengthened on Friday as bond investors cheered the latest signals from central banks in China and the eurozone to support the flagging economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late-afternoon trading, the benchmark 10-year <span class="companylink">Treasury</span> note was 5/32 higher, yielding 2.317%. Yields fall as prices rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Europe, Greece’s government bonds led the price rally Friday with the yield on the 10-year Greek government bond dropping over 0.3 percentage point to 7.981%. The yield on the 10-year <span class="companylink">German government</span> bond fell to 0.771%. The yield on the 10-year <span class="companylink">U.K. government</span> debt declined to 2.048%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">China’s central bank</span> announced Friday to lower interest rates for the first time in more than two years. The <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> started buying asset-backed securities Friday. ECB President Mario Draghi said Friday that the bank is ready to take fresh monetary stimulus, boosting optimism that it would buy government bonds in the eurozone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Central bank actions are putting downward pressure on global rates,” said Andrew Hollenhorst, interest-rate strategist at <span class="companylink">Citigroup Global Markets Inc</span>. in New York. “It is just more evidence of central banks being willing to react to slowing growth with accommodative monetary policy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The news came as global policy makers and investors confront an uneven pace of the global economic growth, lower energy prices and alarming low inflation in the eurozone. While the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> has stopped buying bonds amid an improving U.S. economy, other major central banks including the ECB and the <span class="companylink">Bank of Japan</span> have stepped up stimulus this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major central banks have cut interest rates to record lows and embarked on unconventional easing measures such as buying government bonds following the 2008 financial crisis. The generous liquidity has kept global bond yields at very low levels and propped up prices of many riskier assets such as stocks, junk bonds and commodities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The news out of China and the eurozone boosted investors’ appetites for riskier assets. The preference initially sapped demand for ultrasafe <span class="companylink">Treasury</span> bonds, pushing the 10-year <span class="companylink">Treasury</span> yield higher to 2.354% earlier Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But buyers stepped in as Mr. Draghi’s comments raised speculation that the next step for the ECB would be to buy government bonds which sent yields in the eurozone falling broadly. U.S. bonds offer much more attractive yields compared with many developed bond markets. The rising dollar has added to the allure of U.S. financial assets to foreign buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“U.S. bonds continue to be attractive against the backdrop of low global bond yields,” said James DeMasi, chief fixed-income strategist at <span class="companylink">Stifel Nicolaus Co</span>. in Baltimore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The uneven pace of the global economy has drawn investors into <span class="companylink">U.S. government</span> bonds this year even as the U.S. economy has gained traction and the <span class="companylink">Fed</span> wound down its monthly bond buying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-year <span class="companylink">Treasury</span> yield has fallen from 3% at the start of January. The yield has traded in a tight band of 2.27% and 2.4% in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is tough to bet on higher yields in the Treasury market at the moment,” said Jason Rogan, managing director of <span class="companylink">U.S. government</span> bond trading in New York at <span class="companylink">Guggenheim Securities LLC</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year through Thursday, <span class="companylink">Treasury</span> bonds overall have handed investors a total return—including price changes and interest payments—of 4.19%, according to <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>. <span class="companylink">Treasury</span> bonds maturing in 10 years or longer have returned 18.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, a survey showed that manufacturing and services activity in the eurozone fell to a 16-month low in November. In China, the preliminary HSBC China manufacturing purchasing managers index fell to 50.0, the lowest reading since May. But U.S. existing home sales rose by 1.5% last month, compared with economists’ forecast of a 0.1% decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Fed</span> officials have signaled patience in raising official interest rates from near zero amid contained inflation and mixed global growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many investors expect the <span class="companylink">Fed</span> to start raising rates in the second half of 2015, which has bolstered investors’ confidence that bond yields wouldn't rise sharply.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts fell 2.8% in October from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.009 million units, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. But the decline was driven by a slide in multifamily properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New construction on single-family units, roughly two-thirds of the market, rose 4.2% in October to reach its best pace since November 2013. Through the first 10 months of 2014, the number of single-family homes that builders started is up 5.3%, compared with the same period in 2013. That is a modest improvement, not the rapid acceleration some economists had projected would stir stronger growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The "gradual upward trend in housing starts" is supported by single-family building, <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> economist Blerina Uruci said. "We maintain our view that housing activity continues to recover, although the pace of the recovery remains slower than in the previous couple of years."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits, a bellwether of future construction, increased 4.8% last month to a 1.08 million rate, the best pace since June 2008. The recent growth in permitting, however, has been driven by multifamily properties. Individual units in that category tend to contribute less to employment and economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of houses builders started has slowly rebounded since the recession ended in mid-2009, but the pace remains well off from the annual average of 1.7 million from 1996 to 2006.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A gauge of home-builder sentiment rose in November -- with the first sign of optimism in the Northeast region since 2006 -- a hopeful signal for the U.S. housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing-market index for new single-family homes rose four points to a seasonally adjusted level of 58 this month, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A reading over 50 means most builders generally see conditions as positive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index has now been above the 50-point mark for five consecutive months, said David Crowe, the home-builder group's chief economist. "Low interest rates, affordable home prices and solid job creation are contributing to a steady housing recovery," he said. Now, economists are looking to see how the optimism plays out in terms of single-family housing starts, which have remained tepid over the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While housing starts are up this year, construction of apartment buildings and other multifamily dwellings has outpaced the building of new single-family homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction this year through September rose 22.7% on structures with five or more units, compared with the first nine months of 2013. Single-family-home construction rose 3.8% from a year earlier, according to the Commerce Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The key question now is if single-family starts are on their way to a rate seen in the past when the home-builder survey was registering readings similar to current ones," MFR Inc. chief U.S. economist Joshua Shapiro said in a note to clients. He doubts it, "given a considerable supply overhang of existing homes that is presenting significant competition to the new home market and likely will for the foreseeable future."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, Mr. Shapiro said, "we expect a very slow rise in single-family starts going forward, with the earlier jump representing a move back toward more sustainable levels after activity plunged to rock-bottom post-bubble lows."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Beazer Homes USA Inc</span>. Chief Executive Allan Merrill lends credence to the caution. "Despite favorable demographics and excellent affordability, demand for new homes has been uneven and, over the course of the year, somewhat disappointing," Mr. Merrill told analysts last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAHB sentiment gauge rose in all four regions of the country in November from the prior month. In the Northeast it hit 51, the first time the region has seen a reading of 50 or above since April 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It remains to be seen if the Northeast's upward trend will hold in the coming months. The three-month moving average for the region rose to 44 in November from 41 in October, reaching its highest level since June 2006 but remaining well below the 50-point mark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starts on new single-family homes declined 5.5% in the Northeast during the first nine months of 2014 compared with the same period a year earlier, according to the Commerce Department. But construction of multifamily dwellings, like apartment buildings, has been much more robust. Overall, housing starts in the region are up 18.1% so far this year compared with 2013.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Michael Calia </div><div>540 words</div><div>19 November 2014</div><div>06:50</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-improvement retailer Lowe’s Cos. on Wednesday raised its outlook, as its sales and profit grew in the most recent reporting period, and the company maintained its cautious optimism about improvement in the U.S. housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of the company rose nearly 6% in price in recent late-morning trading, as the results exceeded analysts’ expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lowe’s posted its results for the most recent period a day after bigger rival <span class="companylink">Home Depot Inc</span>. reported sales that exceeded expectations. It also reiterated its confidence in a slow-but-steady U.S. housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the quarter ended Oct. 31, Lowe’s posted earnings of $585 million, or 59 cents a share, up from $499 million, or 47 cents a share, a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Net sales rose 5.6% to $13.68 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts had projected 58 cents a share in earnings and $13.55 billion in revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lowe’s said it sees encouraging signs in the housing market, pegging consumer confidence in the market at prerecession highs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chief Executive Robert A. Niblock said the company’ is cautiously optimistic outlook comes as customers, buoyed by lower fuel prices and interest rates as well as appreciation in home values, are looking to invest in their homes more now than at any point since 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lowe’s reported a 5.1% increase in same-store sales for the most recent quarter, compared with Home Depot’s 5.2% increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview, Mr. Niblock played down any potential benefit to Lowe’s from Home Depot’s recent data breach, in which millions of customers’ personal and financial data were compromised.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think that our strong performance in the quarter was really driven by internal initiatives that we’ve been working on over the past several years,” the CEO said, adding the company has also taken advantage of what he called a strengthening macroeconomic backdrop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for potential data-security concerns at Lowe’s, Mr. Niblock said the company has placed a heavy focus on protecting customer information, while taking a proactive approach to prevent and defend against any such intrusions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">”We’re doing everything we can to have a safe and secure environment for customer data,” Mr. Niblock said. “Each time there’s one of these incidents that take place, we certainly have a team that focuses on learning everything we can about what happened, how it happened, and we go back and layer what we learned there over our plans.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lowe’s, meanwhile, upgraded its expectations for full-year sales growth to 4.5% -5% from a previous projection of 4.5%. It also sees same-store sales expanding 3.5%-4%, compared with previous guidance of 3.5%. Lowe’s had lowered its guidance in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company also increased its earnings forecast for the year ending Jan. 30 by five cents a share to $2.68.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Niblock said during a conference call that average ticket rose 3.4%, while transactions grew 1.7%. He added that the company has experienced an encouraging rise in big-ticket purchases, although most home-improvement purchases have been smaller. </p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto and Eliot Brown </div><div>901 words</div><div>18 November 2014</div><div>15:52</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City Hall is considering a proposal that could take advantage of a soaring luxury real-estate market to help deliver on Mayor Bill de Blasio’s $41 billion affordable-housing plan by raising the tax on top-priced apartment sales, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan, which would direct the additional money to affordable housing, would require the approval of the state Legislature. It is unclear just how seriously the de Blasio administration is considering a push for it in a legislative session shaping up to include several fights on real-estate policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But city officials have floated the idea with real-estate executives. While some of them oppose the notion as discriminatory against high-end buyers and an unreliable way to raise revenue, a handful of influential developers have been supportive of the concept, according to real-estate executives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supporters include Stephen Ross, chairman of Related Cos., the city’s most prolific developer. While most active in the luxury and office segment, Mr. Ross has been pushing the city to fund more so-called workforce housing aimed at middle-income families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and other Related executives have told other developers they believed an increase in the so-called mansion tax—which levies a 1% state tax on housing sales over $1 million—would be a good source of money given the strength of the ultraluxury apartment market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others said they would support such a plan—particularly as an alternative to other proposals being advocated by some tenant groups, including an annual tax on second homes or rescinding a tax break that encourages rental developments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“A tax on very high-end condos would be a better way to create resources for affordable housing than further taxing rental development,” said Jed Walentas, who is redeveloping the site of the Domino Sugar factory in Brooklyn with more than 2,000 apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the details of any increase to be proposed are unclear, the city’s Independent Budget Office ran the numbers on a similar proposal to levy an additional 0.5% tax on apartment sales of $5 million or more that it said would generate $34 million in 2015, increasing in subsequent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current 1% mansion tax generated $259 million for the state in fiscal year 2013, according to the New York State Division of Budget. That is up significantly from the real-estate slump, when the tax generated $176 million for the state in fiscal 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate executives said that any successful proposal would likely be more complex than a simple, broad-based increase in the mansion tax and the additional proceeds would go to the city. For example, it might impose a higher tax on top-level sales—say, at least $10 million—than on lower-priced sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When asked about the administration’s Albany agenda at a hearing Monday, Housing Preservation and Development Department Commissioner Vicki Been said the city planned to push for changes to the 421-a city tax break for new development and the J-51 tax break for renovating apartment buildings; strengthening the city’s rent laws; and changing certain tax exemptions. She didn’t mention the mansion tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for the mayor’s office said, “We are still developing our legislative agenda for the coming session. We fully intend to work with our partners in government on a range of affordable-housing priorities at the state level.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposal has been in the air at City Hall for months. It was in a draft version of the mayor’s affordable-housing strategy, but was dropped before it was presented in May, people familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a Republican-led state <span class="companylink">Senate</span>, elected with the help of generous donations from the real-estate industry, developers are in a strong political position going into the legislative session that opens in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the willingness of some developers to back the proposal could help demonstrate they are supporting affordable housing and create goodwill with the administration as the real-estate industry plans to lobby lawmakers seeking the upper-hand on policies such as 421-a. Tenant groups are advocating to push back against developers and landlords on those issues, which come up for renewal in the spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It certainly may be that they support this to get what they want on the housing and rent control laws,” said Mitchell Moss, a <span class="companylink">New York University</span> urban planning and policy professor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some in the industry questioned the effectiveness of the tax as a revenue stream. Douglas Durst, chairman of the Durst Organization, said he wouldn’t oppose raising the mansion tax, but said it was an ineffective way to raise money because it could largely dry up if the market slows down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Gary Barnett, the developer of One57, said he was against a proposal that would target the top end of the market. “Anything that’s discriminatory against a class of owners, visitors, buyers in New York City sends the wrong message and will be counterproductive,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was more supportive of the potential for a broad-based increase in the mansion tax to assist affordable housing, saying, “I don’t think that’s crazy.”</p>

</div><div class="author">By Daniel J. Goldstein </div><div>1166 words</div><div>15 November 2014</div><div>15:14</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Sunday</div><div>SNJR</div><div>WSJSunday</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The impact of the real-estate bubble has only made appraisers harder to work with.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1‘We’re working under a cloud.’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are about 80,000 real-estate appraisers in the U.S., and they play a key role in most home sales: Until they weigh in with a determination of a property’s value, the buyer typically can’t finalize a mortgage. (Appraisers also play roles in property-tax appeals and home-equity lending, among other transactions.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The profession got a reputational black eye, however, during the housing bust, when some appraisers were accused of fudging their numbers so that unscrupulous lenders could approve loans for unqualified buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a reaction to such allegations, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Protection Act of 2010 required more state and federal supervision of appraisers, and put more pressure on lenders to work through appraisal management companies, or <span class="companylink">AMCs</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These independent firms are designed to keep appraisers and lenders from getting too cozy, explains Sam Heskel, manager of appraisal firm Nadlan Valuation in Brooklyn, N.Y. The law also gave consumers greater recourse to complain to federal regulators about appraisers’ behavior.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But appraisers say that new rules have made the process slower and more complicated for consumers—and that they haven’t stopped some appraisers from yielding to pressure from banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2‘We don’t know your neighborhood.’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One unintended consequence of the Dodd-Frank reforms: AMCs are increasingly sending out-of-county or out-of-state appraisers to calculate property values. “They may not know the area all that well, and not use the right [comparisons],” says Phil Huff, CEO of Platinum Data Solutions, an appraisal-data company in Aliso Viejo, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This matters because inaccurate appraisals can hurt consumers. An appraisal that undervalues a property may keep a seller from getting a fair price; one that’s too high could put a mortgage out of reach for a buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3‘We work for the bank, not for you...’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The typical appraisal costs between $350 and $500, according to Zillow, and it’s paid for by the consumer (usually the buyer). But the appraisal is actually owned by the bank, and in some cases, homeowners and buyers are adversely affected by appraisals they never personally see.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers do have recourse: Federal law requires that a copy be given to consumers who request it in writing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4‘But banks still don’t trust us.’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the housing bust, many banks tried to resell homes they’d foreclosed on—only to find that their real value was far lower than the appraiser had suggested. “The home wasn’t in the condition the appraiser said it was, and sometimes the home wasn’t even there,” says Greg Schroeder, president of Comergence Compliance Monitoring, a Mission Viejo, Calif., appraisal-technology company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In part to satisfy the banks, regulations now require appraisers to fill out more paperwork, with the size of the typical appraisal record having doubled to about 30 pages. “Most of this work is defensive in nature,” says Lora Helt, an appraiser in San Jose. “If the deal goes bad, the first person that gets blamed is the appraiser.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5‘Get a second opinion (maybe in advance).’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When an appraiser’s decision jeopardizes a deal, consumers are likely to feel aggrieved. The <span class="companylink">Appraisal Institute</span>, an industry trade group, says that such situations aren’t uncommon, especially in “distressed” markets, and it encourages consumers to get a second opinion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some real-estate pros advocate getting an independent valuation estimate, even before the appraiser shows up. Buyers and sellers can ask their real-estate agents to provide a broker price opinion: Those estimates themselves may not always be accepted by lenders, but they can give the borrower a baseline from which to judge an official appraisal’s accuracy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Heskel advises that buyers get at least two opinions, even if they’re paying cash. Differences in estimates can knock $10,000 to $20,000 off the final sale price of a home, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">6‘It’s too hard to get this job.’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many states, it takes relatively little training to qualify as a home inspector or real-estate agent. But for appraisers, simply becoming a trainee requires 75 hours of classroom time, according to the Appraisal Institute. To become a licensed residential appraiser is another 150 hours of classroom time; higher levels of certification have even heavier requirements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given that some residential appraisers earn only about $150 per job after the AMCs take their cut, many would-be trainees are put off by the educational hurdles, says Mr. Schroeder: “There’s too much work for too little money.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">7‘Our ranks are shrinking (and aging).’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2010, there were 90,000 appraisers in the U.S. By last June, that figure had shrunk more than 10%, according to the Appraisal Institute, which says its ranks are thinning due to retirements and fewer people entering the profession. Today, more than half of appraisers are between 51 and 65 years old.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">8‘We’ve got some bad news about your home makeover.’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some homeowners assume that spending $50,000 on, say, a fancy new kitchen will raise the value of their house by $50,000. But that’s seldom the case: Ambitious home-improvement projects “are often not worth the price in a resale situation,” says Lance Coyle, incoming president of the Appraisal Institute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which renovations are more likely to raise a home’s value? A fresh coat of paint in neutral colors, or new fixtures, can add value the fastest, says Mr. Coyle, as can “green” renovations that pay the homeowner back in lower utility bills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">9‘Don’t follow us around.’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some homeowners confuse the roles of home inspectors (who assess the physical condition of a home) and appraisers (who estimate its sale value). One key way in which they differ: While many inspectors want consumers to follow them around—so they aren’t shocked when they’re presented with a multi-page fix-it list—experts say there’s no benefit for the owner or buyer in tagging along with the appraiser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">10‘Someday, drones could do our jobs.’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A typical appraisal takes about eight hours to complete, even if only an hour is spent at the property itself, says Ms. Helt, the San Jose appraiser. Behind the scenes, appraisers gather property records and data on land values and check features of the home against “comps”—similar homes sold in the same area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But technology is speeding up the process. “Big Data” software has eased the gathering of real-estate information, while tools like <span class="companylink">Google</span> Earth are figuring in more appraisers’ research. Even drones could soon come into play, if regulators allow their commercial use. “I don’t think there’s a replacement for boots on the ground, but the precise way a piece of collateral information is collected will change,” Mr. Huff says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Chinese insurer agreed to buy the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York City in October. A Business &amp; Finance article Wednesday about Fosun International Ltd. looking to expand its real-estate holdings incorrectly said the deal happened in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(WSJA November 13, 2014)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHANGHAI -- Chinese conglomerate <span class="companylink">Fosun International Ltd</span>. is looking to expand its real-estate holdings abroad, even as foreign competitors bridle at the high prices Chinese buyers have been paying for commercial property, homes and other assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fosun made a splash last year when it purchased New York's Chase Manhattan Plaza for $725 million and London's Lloyds Chambers for GBP 64.5 million ($102 million).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, backed by bank loans and funds from insurers, Fosun is on the hunt for real estate in cities such as Los Angeles, Paris, Hamburg, Frankfurt, Lisbon and Sydney, said Xu Xiaoliang, president of Fosun Property, the company's real-estate arm. The firm is finalizing a deal in Los Angeles that could close by the end of the year, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Xu, in an interview in his Shanghai office overlooking the Huangpu River and downtown skyline, said Fosun is looking for office, hotel and residential assets and is interested in completed buildings and development projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S., with its expanding economy and well-established regulatory framework, is an attractive market, Mr. Xu said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fosun also is eyeing property-services firms. In May, it bought Tokyo-based real-estate management firm <span class="companylink">IDERA Capital Management Ltd</span>. for an undisclosed sum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the group delisted its property unit from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2011, Fosun has placed less emphasis on China's hotel and office sectors, given oversupply problems and intensified competition, and is focusing more on niche projects such as senior-living centers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fosun Property expects to more than triple its assets under management to 500 billion yuan ($81.7 billion) by 2020 from 140 billion yuan. It also plans to boost the share of its overseas real estate to 50% of its portfolio from 21%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While overseas expansion could boost Fosun's profits and act as a hedge against a downturn in China, it also carries risks, analysts said. "They've only just started buying property abroad in recent years," said Kai Hu, senior credit officer in <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Corporate Finance Group, adding that there could be "refinancing risks if the cash flow from their real-estate operations can't cover their loan repayment at its maturity."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fosun is one of many Chinese individual and institutional investors buying more real estate abroad to diversify operations in the face of a domestic downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this has created tension in some countries, including Australia, Singapore and Canada, amid complaints that rivals are getting priced out of the market by flush Chinese buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This month, a Chinese insurer agreed to buy the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York City from <span class="companylink">Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc</span>. for $1.95 billion, the highest price ever for a U.S. hotel, brokers said, although it isn't the highest on a per-room basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Australia, foreign investors bought about one of every six new or yet-to-be-built houses or apartments sold in the third quarter, according to a <span class="companylink">National Australia Bank</span> survey. That has helped fuel price increases of about 10% in Australian homes nationwide over the past year and nearly 15% in Sydney.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawmakers there have come under pressure to respond. Philip Lowe, deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, reminded banks in a recent speech to be prudent in mortgage lending and be mindful of risks as home prices soar. "At least some parts of the housing market have become unbalanced and this has generated some increase in overall risk," Mr. Lowe said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FRANKFURT—Deutsche Bank AG is close to selling most of a $2 billion portfolio of commercial real-estate loans to U.S. private-equity firm TPG, people familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal is driven by an upswing in the U.S. commercial real-estate market, which will allow Deutsche Bank to post a profit on the sale, these people said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The transaction is subject to regulatory approval but could be signed as soon as this month, these people said. Deutsche Bank, Germany’s largest lender, will retain a minority stake in the portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The assets to be sold include mortgages for shopping malls and office buildings originated by Deutsche Bank and outstanding debt that it bought on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale comes amid Deutsche Bank’s effort to reduce assets on its balance sheet to mitigate effects of increasingly strict banking rules. The German lender aims by the end of next year to shed €250 billion ($313 billion) in assets, weighted by their risk. At the end of September it had already disposed of nearly €200 billion in assets, or roughly 80% of its target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. commercial real-estate market has surged recently. Banks issued $28 billion in commercial mortgage-backed securities, or CMBS, in the third quarter, the highest quarterly level since the housing crisis hit in 2007, according to data from Commercial Mortgage Alert. Deutsche Bank is poised to sweep the four major league tables for underwriters and lenders of these securities. The bank said in May it would continue investing in strengthening its U.S. commercial real estate financing business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Booming demand for commercial real estate securities is increasingly attracting private-equity firms, who are amassing funds from investors looking to bet on rising commercial-property prices around the world. TPG is pushing a step further by snapping up commercial real-estate brokers that link buyers to sellers and landlords to renters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A venture led by TPG last week completed a $1.05 billion acquisition of Chicago-based DTZ, a real estate services firm with 209 offices in 52 countries and more than $1.9 billion in annual revenue. TPG plans to merge DTZ with <span class="companylink">Cassidy Turley</span>, a Washington, D.C., firm, which the venture is set to buy before the end of the year, in a deal valued at up to $600 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Cassidy Turley is a leading real estate services business in the U.S. and will complement DTZ’s existing very strong businesses in Asia and Europe as well as DTZ’s existing U.S. businesses,” Ben Gray, Managing Partner Asia at TPG said in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commercial real-estate industry has seen a flurry of acquisitions in recent years, partly in response to globalization. As companies have opened offices throughout the world, they increasingly have preferred real-estate firms that can help them solve their space needs in numerous locations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deutsche Bank’s portfolio being sold is held by its special situation group, which is headed by Jonathan Pollack, the bank’s global head of commercial real estate and head of risk for structured finance. Mr. Pollack, a leading figure in commercial real estate financing, previously helped start the bank’s European commercial real-estate business and ran the European commercial mortgage-backed securities trading desk.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Esther Fung  </div><div>899 words</div><div>11 November 2014</div><div>13:37</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHANGHAI—Chinese conglomerate <span class="companylink">Fosun International Ltd</span>. is looking to expand its real-estate holdings abroad, even as foreign competitors bridle at the high prices Chinese buyers have been paying for commercial property, homes and other assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fosun made a splash last year when it purchased New York’s Chase Manhattan Plaza for $725 million and London’s Lloyds Chambers for £64.5 million ($102 million).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, backed by bank loans and funds from insurers, Fosun is on the hunt for real estate in cities such as Los Angeles, Paris, Hamburg, Frankfurt, Lisbon and Sydney, said Xu Xiaoliang, president of Fosun Property, the company’s real-estate arm. The firm is finalizing a deal in Los Angeles that could close by the end of the year, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In major cities abroad, there are still assets that are undervalued,” Mr. Xu said. He said Fosun is looking for office, hotel and residential assets and is interested in completed buildings and development projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S., with its expanding economy and well-established regulatory framework, is an attractive market, Mr. Xu said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fosun also is eyeing property-services firms. In May, it bought Tokyo-based real-estate management firm <span class="companylink">IDERA Capital Management Ltd</span>. for an undisclosed sum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the group delisted its property unit from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2011, Fosun has placed less emphasis on China’s hotel and office sectors, given oversupply problems and intensified competition, and is focusing more on niche projects such as senior-living centers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fosun Property expects to more than triple its assets under management to 500 billion yuan ($81.7 billion) by 2020 from 140 billion yuan. It also plans to boost the share of its overseas real estate to 50% of its portfolio from 21%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While overseas expansion could boost Fosun’s profits and act as a hedge against a downturn in China, it also carries risks, analysts said. “They’ve only just started buying property abroad in recent years,” said Kai Hu, senior credit officer in <span class="companylink">Moody’s</span> <span class="companylink">Corporate Finance Group</span>, adding that there could be “refinancing risks if the cash flow from their real-estate operations can’t cover their loan repayment at its maturity.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fosun is one of many Chinese individual and institutional investors buying more real estate abroad to diversify operations in the face of a domestic downturn [http://online.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/china-home-prices-continue-to-skid-1412069291?tesla=y&amp;mg=reno64-wsj&amp;url=http://online.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/article/SB10174660853354833355504580185611290600890.html].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this has created tension in some countries, including Australia, Singapore and Canada, amid complaints that rivals are getting priced out of the market by flush Chinese buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October, a Chinese insurer agreed to buy the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York City from <span class="companylink">Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc</span>. for $1.95 billion, the highest price ever for a U.S. hotel, brokers said, although it isn’t the highest on a per-room basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Australia, foreign investors bought about one of every six new or yet-to-be-built houses or apartments sold in the third quarter, according to a <span class="companylink">National Australia Bank</span> survey. That has helped fuel price increases of about 10% in Australian homes nationwide over the past year and nearly 15% in Sydney.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawmakers there have come under pressure to respond. Philip Lowe, deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, reminded banks in a recent speech to be prudent in mortgage lending and be mindful of risks as home prices soar. “At least some parts of the housing market have become unbalanced and this has generated some increase in overall risk,” Mr. Lowe said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Xu of Fosun said higher prices are a normal result of cities becoming more international, as seen in Australia. “This to a certain extent has to do with investment demand,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of China’s recent overseas investments seem less driven by profit than a desire to learn the ropes in overseas markets, property consultant Cushman &amp; Wakefield said in a recent report.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Chelsey Dulaney </div><div>204 words</div><div>10 November 2014</div><div>02:45</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll Brothers Inc. said revenue in its October quarter surged 29%, lifted by strong demand in the home builder’s West Coast division.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll reported preliminary revenue of $1.35 billion for the quarter ended Oct. 31, topping the $1.31 billion expected by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue in its West Coast division jumped 25%, while revenue in its mid-Atlantic division climbed 17%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Toll’s average home price increased to $747,000 from $703,000 a year ago, as the company continues to benefit from a slowly improving housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“For the first time in four quarters, our contracts were up in both dollars and units compared with the prior year’s same period,” said Chief Executive Douglas C. Yearley, Jr.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The value of Toll’s contracts increased 16%, while the value of its backlog edged up 3.4%. A higher backlog in its West Coast division was offset by a decline in its mid-Atlantic division.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll Brothers reported the preliminary results ahead of Thursday’s investor meetings. The company will report results for the quarter on Dec. 10.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a 7-acre property in Silicon Valley went on the market for $14.85 million, a busload of real-estate agents arrived for a tour. The draw? In addition to the resort-style pool and the putting green, the agents, who specialize in finding upscale properties for Asian buyers, wanted to see the two guesthouses -- ideal spaces for aging parents and in-laws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I probably did $18 million worth of business with Asians in the last 12 months," said Arthur Sharif, associate broker at <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span> in San Francisco who is listing the estate in Woodside, Calif. "A huge, huge part of the conversation with these folks is the side house," and how it can accommodate elderly relatives, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Put away the snarky in-law jokes. For both domestic and foreign buyers, the hottest amenity in real estate these days is an in-law unit, an apartment carved out of an existing home or a stand-alone dwelling built on the homeowners' property. While the adult children get the peace of mind of having mom and dad nearby, real-estate agents say the in-law accommodations are adding value to their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an analysis of real-estate listings, homes with in-law units, technically called accessory-dwelling units (ADUs), were priced about 60% higher than houses without them, according to real-estate website Zillow, which examined the past four years of new listings in major cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a 2012 survey of 550 homeowners with one or more living parents by <span class="companylink">PulteGroup</span>, one of the nation's largest home builders, 32% of respondents said they expected to have an aging relative live with them in the future. In its Southwest markets, Pulte last year rolled out "casitas," stand-alone in-law units; in the Southeast the company has introduced MultiGen dwellings that are built into the main home. Miami-based <span class="companylink">Lennar</span>, another large builder, introduced NextGen dwellings in late 2011 that are part of the main home but have a separate entrance. Sales of homes with NextGen spaces grew by 27% year-over-year, said Jeff Roos, <span class="companylink">Lennar</span>'s Western region president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span>, a luxury builder based in Horsham, Pa., has been building more communities that include both large, single-family homes and smaller houses designed for empty nesters, said chief marketing officer Kira Sterling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Architects also cite an uptick in requests for in-law units. "We hardly ever do a house anymore that doesn't have multiple buildings," often as dwellings for aging parents, said Michael Frederick, an architect in Beaufort, S.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and his architect wife, Jane, combined two bedrooms in their home to make a one-bedroom apartment for Ms. Frederick's mother, Ann Lunsford Young. At 81 years old and coping with health issues, Ms. Young downsized from her 3,100-square-foot home in Tennessee and now rents the 500-square-foot apartment in her daughter and son-in-law's home. Ms. Young paid for the renovation, which cost about $40,000 and included transforming a walk-in closet into a kitchenette and installing a skylight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Likewise, Alyce Pollock, 89, moved from a 2,800-square-foot house in Watsonville, Calif., and now rents a 1,000-square-foot apartment in Santa Cruz, Calif., on the property owned by her daughter, Janet Pollock, and son-in-law, architect Mark Primack. The couple spent $450,000 to build an 1,800-square-foot house on a lot they owned next door to their own home. The house includes the two-story unit where Ms. Pollock lives and a small studio for Mr. Primack.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Young and Ms. Pollock both say that having their children living just steps away helped ease the transition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I had to make new friends and find new exercises, and find a new fit for what I'm doing," Ms. Pollock said. "But it's great. I'm never lonely and I always know they are right next door."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, moving meant each woman had to pare down a lifetime of belongings. "I went from 3,100 square feet to 500. But really, this is all I need," said Ms. Young.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Minimalism, however, is in the eye of the beholder. Seeing Ms. Pollock fill the sleek, modern space he designed with her lifelong furniture and "tchotchkes" gave him a jolt, Mr. Primack said. "The architect has to let go," he sighed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently, homeowners in many areas weren't able to build in-law units on their properties because of local regulations that made them either illegal or too complex to build. But efforts by lobbying groups like AARP and individuals like Portland-based ADU blogger and educator Kol Peterson have led to loosened rules in some areas, advocates say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fully permitted in-law units see the highest property values in areas where short-term rentals are both in-demand and legal, brokers in various parts of the country said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Frederick/Young home would likely list in the $800,000 range, said broker Edward Dukes, managing partner of <span class="companylink">Lowcountry Real Estate</span>, which sells luxury property. The Primack/Pollock house might list for around $1 million, said Lauren Spencer, a <span class="companylink">Coldwell Banker</span> broker in Santa Cruz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Oakland, Calif., Larson Shores Architects recently launched a division called Inspired Independence to focus on housing solutions for aging parents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, Rosan Gomperts and her wife, Kim Gaumer, installed a Larson Shores-designed dwelling in the backyard of their Mountain View, Calif., home. Ms. Gomperts' parents, Connie, 92, and Robert, 87, paid about $200,000 for the construction and moved cross-country from Virginia into the prefabricated, wheelchair-accessible home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While both women are happy to have the elderly couple close by, it has been surprisingly stressful to deal with their many health issues. "It's unclear how sustainable this all is, in all honesty," said Ms. Gomperts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inger and Norbert Bischofberger have had the opposite -- albeit less challenging -- experience. In 2004, the couple bought a $5.5 million, 6,700-square-foot house in Hillsborough, partly with the idea that they would build a smaller house for Ms. Bischofberger's father on the property. In 2009, they completed construction on a 405-square-foot Tudor-style in-law cottage. But her 93-year-old father has still not moved in, because he is doing so well and is happy living on his own, Ms. Bischofberger said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"To disrupt that just for the sake of occupying what I built would be wrong," she said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Oakland, Calif., Larson Shores Architects recently launched a division called Inspired Independence to focus on housing solutions for aging parents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, Rosan Gomperts and her wife, Kim Gaumer, installed a Larson Shores-designed dwelling in the backyard of their Mountain View, Calif., home. Ms. Gomperts’ parents, Connie, 92, and Robert, 87, paid about $200,000 for the construction and moved cross-country from Virginia into the prefabricated, wheelchair-accessible home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While both women are happy to have the elderly couple close by, it has been surprisingly stressful to deal with their many health issues. “It’s unclear how sustainable this all is, in all honesty,” said Ms. Gomperts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inger and Norbert Bischofberger have had the opposite—albeit less challenging—experience. In 2004, the couple bought a $5.5 million, 6,700-square-foot house in Hillsborough, partly with the idea that they would build a smaller house for Ms. Bischofberger’s father on the property. In 2009, they completed construction on a 405-square-foot Tudor-style in-law cottage. But her 93-year-old father has still not moved in, because he is doing so well and is happy living on his own, Ms. Bischofberger said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Joe Light </div><div>652 words</div><div>3 November 2014</div><div>12:12</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time home buyers made up the smallest share of U.S. buyers in nearly three decades, a traditionally solid slice of the housing market whose absence is raising questions about the impact of the crash on potential homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The finding, in a report by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>, said about 33% of home buyers were first-time purchasers during the 12-month period that ended in June. That is down from 38% in the year-earlier period and off from the 40% that the group said is the historical norm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the financial crisis, first-time buyers have contended with a confluence of factors making a purchase more difficult. Wages and benefits have been relatively stagnant, growing only 0.5% per quarter on average since the recession, according to a <span class="companylink">Labor Department</span> index released last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the average down payment, typically a hurdle for new buyers, was 18% in September, only slightly lower than the 19% put down in September 2013, according to Ellie Mae, a mortgage software provider that tracks the characteristics of loans run through its platform.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Rising rents and repaying student-loan debt makes saving for a down payment more difficult, especially for young adults who’ve experienced limited job prospects and flat wage growth since entering the workforce,” said NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond the issues of affordability, some renters might be putting off home purchases because of the damage they saw housing do to the last generation of buyers, said Doug Duncan, chief economist of mortgage-finance company <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Duncan said that when looking at reasons for not buying, renters typically don’t put tight mortgage credit as one of the primary concerns. “Today, demand weakness trumps credit tightness,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jill Moylan, a broker and owner of Home Advantage Realty in Columbia, S.C., said that she thinks many recent college and professional graduates have had less confidence in finding and keeping jobs, leading them to choose to rent rather than buy immediately. She said that as a result, some move-up buyers, who would typically sell their starter home to move to a larger one, are instead keeping the property and renting it out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Confidence in the economy is really what we need,” Ms. Moylan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sam Amadon, 34 years old, bought his first home in Columbia, S.C. in July. Mr. Amadon said that home prices in his area didn’t experience the large rise and crash that some other parts of the country did, and that he and his wife are confident they won’t lose money on the home—though they also don’t expect a windfall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It seems like there’s a possibility of it being a wealth-building tool and that we wouldn’t be throwing away so much money on rent. But it’s really just that we like the house,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders have been slow to commit to the first-time buyer segment. Before the housing bust, first-time buyers made up about 40% of the business of Home South Communities LLC, a builder in Suwanee, Ga., said chief financial officer Stephen Palmer. Now, such buyers make up merely 5% of the builder’s business, which Mr. Palmer said is in part a result of little demand from younger buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Millennials saw their parents take a beating on a house. The initial inclination is, ‘I don’t want to get tied down by a house. I saw what happened to my parents,’ ” Mr. Palmer said. He said that the profit margins on entry-level homes are also too low to warrant building them in a slow sales environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR results were based on responses from 6,572 primary home buyers in July. The NAR has conducted the survey since 1981.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Dinny McMahon   </div><div>671 words</div><div>31 October 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEIJING -- Sour loans on the books of China's biggest banks have risen 22% since the start of the year, as slowing economic growth and overcapacity in a number of industries take an increasing toll on the financial sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bad loans remain only a small portion of the overall loan portfolio of China's four biggest state-owned banks, which dominate lending in the world's No. 2 economy after the U.S. The banks also remain profitable, though their profit growth continues to pale compared with the double-digit quarterly surges they posted as recently as 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the growth in nonperforming loans adds to other signs of weakness in the Chinese economy. They include an ailing property market, where average new home prices are declining and where in some cities developers offer incentives ranging from free appliances to iPhones to new fittings for a residence to spur sales. Industrial overcapacity in coal production, steel and textiles is starting to bite, and many small and privately owned firms are struggling to stay afloat, particularly in the manufacturing heartland of the Yangtze and Pearl River deltas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of the third quarter, China's big-four banks -- <span class="companylink">Bank of China Ltd</span>., <span class="companylink">Industrial &amp; Commercial Bank of China Ltd</span>., <span class="companylink">China Construction Bank Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Agricultural Bank of China Ltd</span>. -- had 415 billion yuan ($67.85 billion) of nonperforming loans on their books. That is up 22% from the end of 2013 and is 8% higher than when they last reported data at the end of June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They averaged a nonperforming loan ratio of only 1.14% at the end of September, up from 1.03% at the end of 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The banks also decreased the provisions they set aside against bad loans, suggesting they have been writing down bad debt. The banks didn't disclose details of any write-downs in the third quarter; Chinese banks generally disclose more details in their half-year and full-year results. ICBC posted the sharpest decline in such provisions; they fell more than 70 percentage points, to 216.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Following a debt-fueled investment boom that started in 2008 and has only recently tapered off, economic growth is slowing and many companies are struggling to pay back what they borrowed during the good times. The Chinese economy grew 7.3% during the third quarter, down from 7.4% in the second quarter and 7.7% for all of last year. The third-quarter rate was the slowest since the global financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, interest-rate liberalization has complicated life for the banks by intensifying competition. Last year China removed a floor on lending rates, while officials have discussed removing a cap on deposit rates, which would further ratchet up competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks have been raising funds amid tighter conditions and government requirements that they buff up their capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, <span class="companylink">China Citic Bank Corp</span>., the country's seventh-largest lender by assets, said it plans to raise up to 11.9 billion yuan by selling shares to China's national tobacco company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also Thursday, <span class="companylink">Agricultural Bank of China</span> said third-quarter net profit rose 6% from a year earlier, to 48.41 billion yuan. Nonperforming loans stood at 103.47 billion yuan at the end of September, up from 97.47 billion yuan at the end of June, the bank said. Its bad-loan ratio stood at 1.29%, up from 1.24%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Bank of China</span>, which also reported earnings, said its third-quarter net profit rose 5% from a year earlier, to 41.41 billion yuan, lifted by higher interest income. <span class="companylink">Bank of China</span> also posted 90.7 billion yuan of nonperforming loans as of the end of September, up from 85.86 billion yuan at the end of June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bad-loan ratio stood at 1.07%, up from 1.02%.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto  and Keiko Morris </div><div>718 words</div><div>29 October 2014</div><div>17:06</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neighborhoods from the Garment District to downtown Brooklyn have billed themselves as New York City’s next tech and creative hub. Now lower Manhattan is bolstering its claim with data showing the number of employees in the coveted fields increased 71% in the past five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the presence downtown of financial-services companies falters, brokers and business leaders have increasingly pitched the neighborhood below Chambers Street as an affordable, conveniently located alternative to neighborhoods such as Chelsea and SoHo, where rents have risen and available space is scarce. In one of the most-watched lease deals, Condé Nast is set to begin moving downtown next week into One World Trade Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s the fastest-growing because there’s space and it’s affordable,” said Wes Rudes, a principal at Cresa, a real estate services firm. “If I need 20,000 square feet, what are my choices?…I can go to Hudson Square and pay $60 or $70 a square foot in some cases, or I can go downtown to pay $48, $49.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several companies said the hype around other areas has made one of the city’s oldest neighborhoods, marked by City Hall and the vestiges of Wall Street, look like the fresh choice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We looked at Williamsburg and Dumbo. It seemed a little 2012,” said Andrew Essex, vice chairman of Droga5, an advertising firm with 500 employees globally that recently moved from NoHo to Wall Street. “We were charting our own path.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past four years, 32% of Manhattan leasing by technology, advertising and media companies was in lower Manhattan, compared with 14% from 2007 to 2010, according to the report by LaunchLM, an initiative of the Downtown Alliance, an association of local businesses and property owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Midtown South area that includes Chelsea, Flatiron and SoHo saw its share of the pie shrink for those types of leases—to 40% from 47% over the same time period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower Manhattan still faces significant challenges attracting tech and creative companies. It lacks former industrial buildings with expansive layouts. A number of its older office buildings with less costly space were converted to apartments, and young companies that like to bounce their ideas off peers may find themselves isolated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To address that last concern, LaunchLM on Thursday plans to announce a new, 12,500-square-foot space dubbed “lower Manhattan HQ” at 150 Broadway. The 20th-floor space will give companies an opportunity to network, hold training events and book rooms for special projects. It is scheduled to open next spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It became clear that there was need for a space like this,” said Downtown Alliance President Jessica Lappin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The center was created with $2.5 million in state money secured by Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies said they are starting to feel less like pioneers than they did a decade ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When we first moved in, it was a lot of government agencies, insurance companies and law firms that were populating the building,” said Scott Anderson, a partner at Control Group, a technology and design company that moved to the Woolworth Building in 2007. “Now the makeup of the people on the street is so much different than it was before.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also helping the area is a tax break of $3,000 per eligible employee to firms that relocate some or all of their operations to lower Manhattan. It was established after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and extended this year to 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, despite the growth in new types of companies, downtown has more empty office space than it did before the recession. More than 10.5% of office space was vacant in the third quarter of this year, compared with less than 8% in the third quarter of 2007, according to JLL, a real-estate brokerage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies said the retail and restaurant scene—long a drawback for companies with young employees— has improved with the addition of spots such as Melt Shop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Essex, the advertising executive, said that the area east of Broadway could use more life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“East of Broadway is a gastronomical wasteland,” he said. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tens of millions of elderly and disabled Americans will see a small bump in their government payments next year, another reflection of a sluggish economic recovery that has kept inflation low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Social Security Administration</span> last week announced a 1.7% annual cost-of-living adjustment[http://online.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/low-inflation-flatter-cola-social-security-benefits-to-get-1-7-bump-1414013215?KEYWORDS=eric morath] for the nearly 64 million Americans who receive federal retirement or disability benefits. The increase would result in about a $22-a-month increase for the average retiree. Increases have been between 1.5% and 1.7% for three straight years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The benefit increase in 2015 matches the 1.7% gain in consumer prices in September, compared with a year earlier, according to <span class="companylink">Labor Department</span> data also released last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The small bump nonetheless limits the ability of beneficiaries—about one-fifth of the U.S. population—to step up spending. A majority of people age 65 and older rely on Social Security benefits for at least half of their retirement income, according to <span class="companylink">AARP</span>, the lobbying group for older Americans.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage Rates Tumble</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest rates on mortgages are tumbling again, defying experts who have long predicted a sustained rise and offering borrowers a fresh opportunity to save money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate on a fixed-rate 30-year mortgage[http://online.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/mortgage-rates-tumble-1414079815?mod=WSJ_hp_LEFTWhatsNewsCollection] fell to 4.03% in the week ended Oct. 17—the lowest level since June 2013—and remained there through Thursday, according to mortgage-information website HSH.com. Rates have hovered around that level in the intervening days, HSH.com says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That compares with 4.29% in mid-September and marks a sharp decline from the average rate in the week ended Jan. 3, when it was 4.63%. Declines of that magnitude can translate into tens of thousands of dollars in savings through lower monthly payments over the course of a 30-year mortgage—and potentially even greater savings on jumbo mortgages.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home Sales Climb</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home sales reached the highest level of the year in September, a sign of halting progress in the housing market that could lift the broader economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes[http://online.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-rise-2-4-in-september-1413900192?mod=WSJ_hp_LEFTWhatsNewsCollection] climbed 2.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.17 million in September, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said. Sales had declined slightly in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected sales to rise 1% to a rate of 5.1 million. Home sales exceeded an annual pace of seven million at the height of the last decade’s boom. After the crash, they hit a low of 3.45 million in mid-2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report suggests the housing market resumed the steady climb it began early this year, after hitting a soft patch at the end of summer. Despite the latest progress, the market continues to underperform. Sales in September were down 1.7% compared with a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I would say one year from now, two years from now, things will be much better because we have so many factors that will support home sales,” said Lawrence Yun, the NAR’s chief economist. He noted strong job creation, persistently low interest rates and expanding inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales reached a pace of 5.38 million in mid-2013 but lost momentum amid a rise in interest rates and home prices. They haven’t reached that pace this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices, meanwhile, continue to climb. The median sale price for a home last month stood at $209,700, up 5.6% from a year earlier.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pension-fund managers across the U.S. are rethinking their investments in hedge funds[http://online.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/pension-funds-eye-reducing-hedge-fund-investments-1413762698?KEYWORDS=calpers] in the wake of a retreat by the <span class="companylink">California Public Employees’ Retirement System</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In San Francisco, the chairman of that city’s pension fund has put on hold a vote to invest 15% of its assets in hedge funds. In Austin, Texas, officers responsible for the retirement savings of city police officers are discussing whether to withdraw all of their hedge-fund investments. In Harrisburg, Pa., a prominent state official asked the systems that manage money for teachers and other public workers to reconsider the $7.6 billion parked in such investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We need to be talking about this,” Pennsylvania Auditor General Eugene DePasquale said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new conversations were spurred by <span class="companylink">Calpers</span>, the largest U.S. public pension fund, which last month decided to shed its entire $4 billion in hedge-fund investments over the next year. <span class="companylink">Calpers</span> said the investments were too small a slice of its $298 billion portfolio to justify the time and expense they required.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, average pay gains in the nonprofit field outpaced gains in the broader private sector. Nonprofit pay increased more than 16% between 2007 and 2012, while profit-sector wages advanced almost 12%. The average weekly wage for a nonprofit worker was $85 higher than for a private-sector employee in 2012, the most recent data available. The data exclude government workers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage Rates Tumble</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest rates on mortgages are tumbling again, defying experts who have long predicted a sustained rise and offering borrowers a fresh opportunity to save money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate on a fixed-rate 30-year mortgage fell to 4.03% in the week ended Oct. 17—the lowest level since June 2013—and remained there through Thursday, according to mortgage-information website HSH.com. Rates have hovered around that level in the intervening days, HSH.com says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That compares with 4.29% in mid-September and marks a sharp decline from the average rate in the week ended Jan. 3, when it was 4.63%. Declines of that magnitude can translate into tens of thousands of dollars in savings through lower monthly payments over the course of a 30-year mortgage—and potentially even greater savings on jumbo mortgages.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home Sales Climb</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home sales reached the highest level of the year in September, a sign of halting progress in the housing market that could lift the broader economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes climbed 2.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.17 million in September, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said. Sales had declined slightly in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected sales to rise 1% to a rate of 5.1 million. Home sales exceeded an annual pace of seven million at the height of the last decade’s boom. After the crash, they hit a low of 3.45 million in mid-2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report suggests the housing market resumed the steady climb it began early this year, after hitting a soft patch at the end of summer. Despite the latest progress, the market continues to underperform. Sales in September were down 1.7% compared with a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales reached a pace of 5.38 million in mid-2013 but lost momentum amid a rise in interest rates and home prices. They haven’t reached that pace this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices, meanwhile, continue to climb. The median sale price for a home last month stood at $209,700, up 5.6% from a year earlier.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Rethink on Hedge Funds</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pension-fund managers across the U.S. are rethinking their investments in hedge funds in the wake of a retreat by the <span class="companylink">California Public Employees’ Retirement System</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In San Francisco, the chairman of that city’s pension fund has put on hold a vote to invest 15% of its assets in hedge funds. In Austin, Texas, officers responsible for the retirement savings of city police officers are discussing whether to withdraw all of their hedge-fund investments. In Harrisburg, Pa., a prominent state official asked the systems that manage money for teachers and other public workers to reconsider the $7.6 billion parked in such investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new conversations were spurred by Calpers, the largest U.S. public pension fund, which last month decided to shed its entire $4 billion in hedge-fund investments over the next year. Calpers said the investments were too small a slice of its $298 billion portfolio to justify the time and expense they required.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nonprofit sector largely dodged massive job losses and weak wage growth experienced across most of the U.S. during the recession and first years of the economic recovery, new Labor Department data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nonprofit field, a cross-section of employment mainly in industries such as health care, social assistance, and religious and civic organizations, added jobs each year from 2008 through 2012. By contrast, the broader economy didn’t recover all the jobs lost during recession until this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, average pay gains in the nonprofit field outpaced gains in the broader private sector. Nonprofit pay increased</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">more than 16% between 2007 and 2012, while profit-sector wages advanced almost 12%.

</div><div class="author">By Ben Leubsdorf </div><div>590 words</div><div>24 October 2014</div><div>07:41</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales rose slightly in September after surging in August, hitting their fastest pace of the lackluster recovery despite downward revisions to sales during the summer months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of newly built single-family homes in the U.S. rose 0.2% in September from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 467,000, the Commerce Department said Friday. Sales were up 15.3% in August to a 466,000 pace, revised down from an initial estimate of 504,000. Sales in July and June also were revised down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There is little evidence that the new single-family housing market is decisively breaking out of its medium-term flat pattern,” MFR Inc. chief U.S. economist Joshua Shapiro said in a note to clients. “The best that could be said is that perhaps there is some modest upside impetus.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected sales would come in at a 470,000 annual pace in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department’s estimates for new-home sales can be volatile from month to month. September’s 0.2% gain came with a margin of error of 15.7 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales in September were up 17% from a year earlier. In the first nine months of the year, sales rose 1.7% from the same period in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">September’s 467,000 pace was the highest since July 2008, but still well below historical normal levels. “The general story in the past couple years has been a stalled recovery at a still depressed pace of sales,” <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> economist Ted Wieseman said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newly built homes account for roughly 10% of home purchases in the U.S. Sales of existing homes rose 2.4% in September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.17 million, the fastest pace of the year, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Tuesday. But sales of previously owned homes remained down 1.7% last month from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing sector has gained steam in recent years, but a jump in mortgage rates in mid-2013 threw the recovery off track. Sales of existing homes have risen since the spring, and interest rates have fallen. But the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>, in its September policy statement reiterated its worry about the “slow” housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">”Households with relatively low credit scores continued to have difficulty obtaining mortgage loans,” said minutes of the Fed’s Sept. 16-17 meeting. “It was noted that this difficulty could be a factor restraining the demand for housing, particularly among younger households who have high levels of student loan debt or weak job prospects.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts are up 9.5% so far this year, according to Commerce Department data. But construction of multifamily structures, like apartment buildings, has far outpaced the construction of single-family homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales in September fell from the prior month in the West, were flat in the Northeast and rose in the South and Midwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At last month’s pace, there was a 5.3-month supply of new homes available for sale across the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sale price of a newly built home was $259,000 in September. New homes tend to be more expensive than existing homes, and the gap has widened in recent years. The median sale price for a previously owned home last month was $209,700, according to the Realtors group.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Judge Suspended Over</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sexually Explicit Emails</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Pennsylvania Supreme Court suspended Justice Seamus McCaffery with pay following allegations he had sent emails containing sexually explicit photographs on a government computer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The suspension, announced late Monday, comes amid revelations that sexually explicit emails were shared by members of the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office on agency computers from 2008 to 2012. The news has roiled the state government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The court ordered the Judicial Conduct Board to determine whether misconduct charges should be brought against Justice McCaffery over the alleged emails.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A statement provided Tuesday by a spokesman for Justice McCaffery said, "We are confident that [Justice McCaffery] will be cleared of any wrongdoing and returned to the bench soon."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement last week, Justice McCaffery said: "Unfortunately, personal, private emails between me and some longtime friends were never meant to be viewed by anyone else, but they were. I sincerely apologize for my lapse in judgment."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The emails shared by members of the Attorney General's Office were discovered during a review of the office's investigation of former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky, who was convicted of child sex abuse in 2012. The emails weren't related to that investigation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, in response to requests from news organizations, Democratic Attorney General Kathleen Kane released the names of eight men who sent or received such emails. The emails were shared while the men worked for her Republican predecessors, including Gov. Tom Corbett.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Corbett, who is running for re-election, has said he was unaware of the emails while attorney general and wouldn't have tolerated such conduct.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- A push to tighten mortgage-lending standards in the wake of the housing bust has given way to making credit more accessible as Washington frets about the strength of the housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, federal regulators took a big step toward easing postcrisis lending rules, agreeing to drop a proposed requirement that borrowers make a 20% down payment in order to get a high-quality mortgage. Regulators, heeding warnings of real-estate groups and consumer advocates who said such a move could crimp the ability of millions of Americans to get a mortgage, voted to require only that a bank document a borrower's ability to repay a loan and ensure their debt is below a certain threshold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the federal government is shifting course on <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, announcing plans to use the mortgage giants to expand credit rather than reducing their outsize role in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mel Watt, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which regulates the entities, said earlier this week that Fannie and Freddie are planning to guarantee some loans with down payments of as little as 3%. The companies also have reached an agreement with mortgage lenders defining what kinds of mistakes on loans could result in penalties years after they are issued -- a highly anticipated resolution that could lower barriers and restrictions on borrowers with weak credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York on Tuesday, J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. Chief Executive James Dimon said most forms of credit have loosened since the financial crisis except mortgages. Mortgage credit is too tight, he said. Mr. Dimon attributed that to demands by Fannie and Freddie for banks to repurchase loans that defaulted. They should have changed that a long time ago, he said at a conference held by the <span class="companylink">Urban Land Institute</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The regulatory changes are happening against a backdrop of slowing growth in the housing market. U.S. home sales rose 2.4% last month to the highest level this year but were still down nearly 2% from a year earlier, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Tuesday. Lending has been weak this year because of a drop in refinanced loans, with the total value of mortgage-backed securities issued in 2014 down about 50% from a year earlier, according to trade publication Inside Mortgage Finance. The <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span> expects total lending for home purchases will fall 13.5% this year to $635 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sluggishness is prompting concern in Washington as officials fret that postcrisis attempts to limit credit may have gone too far. Exacerbating those worries is the so-called private-label market for mortgage-backed securities -- those without government backing -- has remained tiny, despite U.S. efforts to jump-start such lending. Only $27.8 billion of such mortgage-backed securities were issued last year, less than 2% of the $1.58 trillion in mortgage securities issued that year, according to Inside Mortgage Finance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think we all underappreciated how long it would take" to restore the market for private mortgage securities, said Jim Parrott, a senior fellow at the <span class="companylink">Urban Institute</span> and a former housing-policy adviser in the Obama administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fannie Mae CEO Timothy J. Mayopoulos, in a discussion at the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span> conference in Las Vegas this week, said the market for private-label mortgage securities "might not come back for quite some time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, regulators moved to ease a rule that critics said could further damp the private mortgage-backed securities market. Under a requirement of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, regulators originally proposed that banks either have "skin in the game" and hold 5% of the risk from the mortgages they package into securities and sell to investors -- or require that borrowers make a 20% down payment to get a loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regulators on Tuesday backed away from the 20% down payment, with officials saying they were sensitive to mortgage-industry concerns about the health of the U.S. housing market and didn't want to add an extra layer of complexity that could constrain lending. Lenders can avoid holding 5% of the risk as long as they verify a borrower's ability to repay the loan and ensure their debt-to-income doesn't exceed 43%. Loans sold to Fannie and Freddie are effectively exempt from the risk-retention requirement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics say Washington's moves are enshrining, perhaps permanently, the dominant role of the federal government in the mortgage market. Some predict the push to loosen lending standards could end just as badly as it did before the 2008 housing bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's certainly possible that this is only the beginning of government pressure to make loans with lower lending standards," said Alex Pollock, a fellow at the <span class="companylink">American Enterprise Institute</span>, which has long pushed for a reduced federal role in the housing system.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jason Chow </div><div>287 words</div><div>22 October 2014</div><div>03:00</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After snapping up luxury condos and commercial properties in New York and Los Angeles, Asian investors are now training their eyes on U.S. apartment buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investment from Asia into U.S. multifamily real estate is set to reach record highs this year, according to a report released by real-estate firm CBRE. Asians have snapped up $522 million worth of multifamily properties during the first eight months of the year, near the 2013 total of $537 million and surpassing the 2012 total of $356 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Asian investors understand residential, especially those in dense, downtown areas,” said Marc Giuffrida, executive director at CBRE Global Capital Markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asian buyers now make up 18% of foreign investment in the asset class—an increase from 8%—while Canadian buyers remain the top foreign investors in the U.S. multifamily category. Asian buyers’ purchases show that they are moving beyond deals for marquee office buildings and hotels and into more-mundane but often more-profitable areas of real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Francisco ranked first for Asian buying, attracting $326 million worth of purchases since January 2013. Los Angeles was second at $252 million, followed by New York at $175 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While investing more in apartment buildings, Asian investors still prefer to buy single properties, as opposed to portfolios of multiple buildings, Mr. Giuffrida said. He added that transactions were typically $10 million to $70 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We haven’t seen the sale with the big number yet,” he said. “But we’ll see the trend accelerate. The private wealth of the market is just starting to pick up. There are more to come.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARKETS AT A GLANCE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Data as of approximately 5 p.m. ET)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SNAPSHOT:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. stocks rallied Tuesday, sparked by upbeat earnings from <span class="companylink">Apple</span> and reports that the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> was considering buying corporate bonds. Treasurys fell on the ECB reports. Oil prices ticked higher on better-than-expected economic data from China. Gold closed at its highest level in six weeks. The dollar gained as an increase in U.S. existing home sales and expectations for higher core inflation improved investors’ outlook for interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OPENING CALL:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Australia will unveil its third-quarter consumer price index data on Wednesday. (In the second quarter, Australia had a 3% annual inflation rate.) Despite the slump in its economy and deflationary forces elsewhere in the world, Australia still produces inflation readings above those of the rest of the world. That doesn’t seem to faze the <span class="companylink">Reserve Bank</span> too much but it’s one of those factors keeping its interest rates more firmly in positive territory than those of the U.S. or Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EQUITIES:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. stocks rallied, with gains in technology stocks propelling the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> Composite to its biggest one-day percentage jump since January 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 215.14 points, or 1.3%, to 16614.81. The S&amp;P 500 gained 37.27 points, or 2%, to 1941.28, marking its biggest one-day percentage gain in a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Nasdaq Composite rose 103.40 points, or 2.4%, to 4419.48. Stocks closed near the highs of the session.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gains were sparked by upbeat earnings from Apple Inc. and reports that the European Central Bank was considering buying corporate bonds. The <span class="companylink">Dow</span> rose for its third session in a row, while the S&amp;P and Nasdaq both notched their fourth straight session of gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rebound in the last few sessions comes after a sharp pullback. The S&amp;P fell 7.4% from its Sept. 18 record close to its recent closing low last Wednesday. The Dow declined 6.7% between its Sept. 19 record close and its recent low on Thursday. The Dow has rallied since then, with Tuesday’s gains dragging the blue-chip index into positive territory for the year, up 0.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We just got oversold,” said Bill Nichols, head of U.S. equities at <span class="companylink">Cantor Fitzgerald</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In corporate news <span class="companylink">Coca-Cola</span> shares fell 6% after the company reported flat soda volumes in the third quarter and an unexpected decline in revenue. The company also introduced a new cost-cutting plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asian shares had a lackluster finish Tuesday after data showed China’s economy grew at a slower pace in the third quarter, albeit a touch faster than expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOREX:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar gained against the euro and the British pound as an increase in U.S. existing home sales and expectations for higher core inflation improved investors’ outlook for interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro fell 0.7% versus the U.S. currency to $1.2715, heading for its lowest close in the Americas in a week. The pound weakened 0.4% against the dollar to $1.6119. The ICE Dollar Index, which measures the dollar against a weighted basket of rival currencies, rose 0.5% to 85.36.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar received a boost after sales of existing homes climbed to the highest level this year in September, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. The number of previously owned homes sold-5.17 million-was above economists’ forecasts and signaled that the housing market was angling into a position to support the U.S. economy, as it once had.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors also positioned themselves for an uptick in inflation numbers that exclude food and energy, or core inflation, for September. Although economists mostly expect U.S. inflation to be unchanged in September from August, they predict core consumer prices rose 0.2% over the span, said Ken Wills, senior corporate dealer at USForex, a company that helps U.S. corporations hedge their currency exposure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The market is expecting some core inflation gains in the U.S. last month, and people are trading on that today,” Mr. Wills said. The monthly report is due to be released at 8:30 a.m. EDT Wednesday.</p>

</div><div class="author">By John Carney </div><div>342 words</div><div>21 October 2014</div><div>10:53</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eleven years ago, Angelo Mozilo declared down payments for home purchases were “nonsense.” Now, U.S. financial regulators are essentially agreeing with the former head of <span class="companylink">Countrywide Financial</span>, which helped inflate the housing bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal agencies on Tuesday began signing off on a revised banking rule that defines when banks will have to retain some risk from mortgages sold to investors. As part of this, regulators dropped the idea of requiring down payments for mortgages exempt from risk-retention rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is a sharp turnaround from an earlier version that required a 20% down payment. It reflects objections from lenders, home builders and consumer advocates, who saw this as a hurdle to higher housing sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given that, regulators adopted a looser definition of a so-called qualified mortgage set by the <span class="companylink">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</span>. Unfortunately, those rules were designed to protect consumers from predatory lending, not the financial system from a repeat of the housing and financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The CFPB rule lacks the loss-sharing feature of down payments. Those can reduce the likelihood of defaults but more importantly create a buffer for the financial system and taxpayers when defaults do occur. Down payments require homeowners to have skin in the game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new rule is also broad enough that it will make risk retention the exception at banks rather than the rule. That turns on its head the Dodd-Frank Act’s aim to ensure banks are at risk if they sell shoddy mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What’s more, it means banks will have little incentive to scrutinize loans deemed qualified mortgages. This could turn them into the new version of triple-A-rated securities in that investors feel little need to verify their quality. Yet if these mortgages prove riskier than regulators anticipate, the entire financial system will be overexposed to them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new rule isn’t just a small step back for mortgages, it is a giant leap backward for the financial system.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Josh Mitchell </div><div>733 words</div><div>21 October 2014</div><div>08:06</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—U.S. home sales reached the highest level of the year in September, a sign of slowly building momentum in a housing market whose recovery has come in fits and starts over the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes climbed 2.4% from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.17 million in September, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Tuesday. That marked the fifth increase in six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report suggests the housing market resumed the steady climb it began early this year, rebounding from a soft spell in August. Interest rates are near historic lows, and stronger job growth is boosting consumers’ confidence and pay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The signs of life in the housing market are generally positive and the resale market appears to be strengthening again,” economist John Ryding of RDQ economics said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the latest progress, the market continues to underperform. Sales in September were down 1.7% compared with a year earlier. Many Americans are continuing to rent or live with others rather than buy, a sign that credit standards remain tight and many families remain financially strained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, the Realtor group’s chief economist, said the market’s short-term outlook remains unclear but the medium-term outlook is bright.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I would say one year from now, two years from now, things will be much better because we have so many factors that will support home sales,” Mr. Yun said. He pointed to strong job creation, persistently low interest rates and expanding inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overall subdued activity has prompted discussions among <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and mortgage lenders to loosen credit standards so more families can obtain loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yun said sales would be roughly 10% higher if credit conditions returned to “normal,” which he defined as the credit standards used by lenders in 2000, before the last decade’s boom and bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales exceeded an annual pace of 7 million at the height of the last decade’s boom; after the crash, they hit a low pace of 3.45 million pace in mid-2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales reached a pace of 5.38 million in mid-2013 but lost momentum amid a run-up in interest rates and home prices. They haven’t reached that pace this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Broad factors are working in the housing market’s favor, including stronger economic growth and a fall in interest rates. The nation’s gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 4.6% in the spring and likely expanded about 3% in the summer, according to economists’ projections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate on a fixed 30-year mortgage has fallen back to levels last seen in June 2013, slipping below 4% last week, according to Freddie Mac. The drop likely reflects investors flocking to the safety of government bonds amid mounting worries about the global economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But tight lending standards remain a major obstacle, with lenders directing loans to only the safest borrowers. Surveys also show that the inability of Americans to come up with down payments remains a major factor holding back sales. Also, investors—who snapped up properties in foreclosure earlier in the recovery—have stepped away from the market this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The outlook on interest rates is unclear as the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> winds down a bond-buying program that was designed to push down borrowing costs. The Fed is set to end that program this month and is considering when to raise short-term interest rates, which also influence mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday’s report showed housing inventory loosened. The number of for-sale homes rose 6% in September compared with a year earlier. At the latest sales pace, it would take 5.3 months to exhaust the housing supply</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices, meanwhile, continue to climb. The median sale price for a home last month stood at $209,700, up 5.6% from a year earlier. Prices have risen year over year for 31 consecutive months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales in September rose in every region but the Midwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors made up 14% of home purchases in September, down from 19% a year earlier. Meanwhile, purchases by first-time buyers have yet to climb significantly after falling earlier in the recovery.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Hong Kong Protests as Much About Dollars as Democracy; Hong Kong’s Tycoons and Wealth Inequality Are Sources of Frustration for Protesters</span>
</div><div class="author">By Kathy Chu </div><div>1339 words</div><div>19 October 2014</div><div>13:49</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HONG KONG—Frustration over this city’s staggering wealth gap and pro-business establishment has helped fuel protests calling for free elections, forming a strong undercurrent to the student-led democracy campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One target of the protesters’ frustration is the city’s tycoons, a handful of families and colonial era conglomerates that control most of the real estate, many of the retailers and nearly all of the utilities and buses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Tycoons don’t need sympathy, but they’re between a rock and a hard place,” said Jean-Pierre Lehmann, a visiting professor in the <span class="companylink">University of Hong Kong</span>’s business and economics program. “Hong Kong has a number of critical problems, such as inequality, and the tycoons are seen as being an emblem of that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hong Kong has one of the world’s biggest wealth gaps and its highest real-estate prices. Years of stagnant wage growth have created deep frustration among students and the middle class.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, protesters are angry about the rising influence of mainland China on the former British colony, but when asked, many students will express frustration with their economic prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the weekend, nearly 70 people were injured and 37 arrested in clashes between the police and demonstrators as the rallies entered their fourth week. Tensions had eased by late Sunday night after protest leaders called for calm ahead of meetings with government officials planned for Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the city’s tycoons have been silent since the protests began. Those who have spoken out have called for an end to the protests while finding gentle words for the pro-democracy movement. Asia’s richest man, Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing, who Forbes says is worth about $31.4 billion, said Wednesday that he understood the “passion” of Hong Kong students but urged them to go home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tycoon’s words don’t resonate with young protesters such as Arnold Chung, 19, who expects to live with his parents for years. Average starting salaries for university graduates have risen 1% annually over the past 17 years, to 198,000 Hong Kong dollars (US$25,522) a year, lagging behind inflation, and far behind the rise in housing prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The young generation doesn’t listen to Li Ka-shing,” said Mr. Chung, a student. “We expect rich people to say this [protest] will disturb the economy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as thousands of protesters took to the streets, Mr. Li’s Cheung Kong property-development arm was unveiling apartments that totaled 165 square feet, among the city’s tiniest homes. The apartments, about the size of a one-car garage, haven’t been priced yet, but slightly larger units have recently sold in the city for between HK$1.77 million and HK$3.6 million (US$228,000 and US$464,000). Mr. Li and Cheung Kong wouldn’t comment beyond Mr. Li’s earlier statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once seen as the proud symbols of Hong Kong’s rising power, tycoons have faced criticism for getting richer while residents fall behind. Many have benefited from China’s growth, which aligns their interests with Beijing and further alienates them from the protesters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“These people are seen to be making a lot of profit with the government’s help,” said Joseph Cheng, a political-science professor at the <span class="companylink">City University of Hong Kong</span>. They are typically family-run empires that have large real-estate businesses—five Hong Kong companies account for 70% of the private residential market, according to brokerage firm CLSA—and government concessions in industries such as telecommunications, ports and transportation. Some own retail outlets in highly concentrated industries such as supermarkets, where two tycoon-owned chains dominate sales, and they have franchises for goods such as <span class="companylink">Coca-Cola</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hong Kong’s tycoons range from Mr. Li, whose empire began with a factory making plastic flowers, to colonial-era conglomerates such as <span class="companylink">Jardine Matheson Holdings</span>, run by the Keswick family, which got rich by trading opium and other goods in the mid-1800s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The wealth concentrated in these families makes Hong Kong among the most unequal places in the world, and the inequality has gotten worse over the past decade. According to Welch Consulting, an economic consulting firm, Hong Kong has 41 billionaires valued at a total of $203.9 billion, equal to 74.4% of the city’s annual economic output. The only country with a higher concentration by this measure is the southern African nation of Swaziland, where the wealth of its one billionaire equals 99% of GDP, the firm’s analysis of <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span> data shows. The ratio for Georgia, the No. 3 ranked country is 32.2% and for the U.S. it is 14.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The wealth of the city has become increasingly concentrated. In 2000, 65.6% of the city’s assets were controlled by the wealthiest 10% of its people, according to <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>. In 2007, the figure was 69.3% and this year it is 77.5%, making the concentration among the highest in the world and the growth among the fastest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some other tycoons have spoken, but carefully. Peter Woo, chair of Hong Kong-based real-estate developer <span class="companylink">Wheelock &amp; Co</span>., said this month that the pro-democracy protests cannot continue, saying that the city has already won because people have the right to protest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jardine Matheson said it respects the public’s right to express its views, but “we believe that any expression of views should also respect the rights of fellow citizens.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of these companies have felt the protests firsthand. Students blocked the road in front of Mr. Li’s headquarters and they forced a third of the Chow Tai Fook jewelry stores, controlled by the family of Cheng Yu-tung, to close early. Guests at Jardine Matheson’s flagship Mandarin Oriental Hotel had to walk 400 meters to their rooms because the street was closed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One way the tycoons exert control over Hong Kong is through the 1,200 member committee that has selected the city’s chief executive. While some members are elected by the public, most are selected by business groups. A new version of this committee will likely be used to approve the candidates for the next chief executive’s election in 2017, which frustrated protesters, who want candidates to be nominated by the public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Negotiations between the city and students are likely to start this week and one area city officials have said could be negotiated is the makeup of that committee. While that could erode the tycoons’ power, few expect the change to be dramatic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Beijing has relied on cooperation with the tycoons to control the selection of the chief executive,” said David Webb, a former investment banker who runs corporate governance site Webb-Site.com. “There’s no way that they’re going to shift the composition of the committee from the tycoons to the pro-democracy camp.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another way the government could placate protesters is to announce a plan to make housing more affordable in Hong Kong. That was a big focus for Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying when he took office and something that Beijing has backed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tycoons’ difficult position was illustrated before the protests exploded, when China’s leaders called them to Beijing to get them to publicly support the rules it has approved for elections in the city. They dutifully traveled to Beijing, met with China’s President Xi Jinping, among others, and made statements afterward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The effort didn’t help much. “Their sway on public opinion is declining, particularly among those below 30,” said Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the <span class="companylink">Chinese University of Hong Kong</span>’s Centre for China Studies. “But nonetheless, Beijing still subscribes to the old belief that Hong Kong people are economic animals, and these tycoons are major employers.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then when the protests hit, most of the tycoons went quiet.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Art Patnaude </div><div>396 words</div><div>18 October 2014</div><div>17:04</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luxury property brokerage Christie’s International Real Estate is making its first foray into the Middle East, opening an office in Dubai.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move is the latest stage in the rapid global expansion of the auction house’s real-estate arm, which now has affiliates in 46 countries, compared with just four offices beyond the U.S. 10 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision to move into Dubai, the most populous city in the United Arab Emirates, comes as the housing market there shows signs of stabilizing after years of capricious price swings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a speculation-fueled housing bubble burst in 2008, dwelling prices in Dubai were cut in half. Last year, they rose by 50%, sparking fresh concerns that another bubble was inflating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, house prices are up 3.8%, according to data from real-estate broker Cluttons. Even the hottest luxury spots—like the villas on the palm tree-shaped islands off the coast, or penthouses in the world’s tallest building—have held steady.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dubai now has “all the merits of a market where we need to be. The government knows Dubai has to be a success,” said Joachim Wrang-Widén. “Before the crisis, we weren’t convinced by the fundamentals.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real-estate arm of rival auction house <span class="companylink">Sotheby’s</span> opened a franchise in Dubai late last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in Dubai have been kept in check by government regulation, including a cap on mortgages, said Faisal Durrani, head of international research at Cluttons. The government is “eager to halt the type of speculation seen before the crisis,” when homes were bought and sold multiple times before construction even began, Mr. Durrani said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Christie’s</span> auction business has operated in Dubai for 10 years. The introduction of the real-estate arm is part of a broader effort to expand that business globally, Mr. Wrang-Widén said. Signing up new affiliates in other countries, such as Israel and India, could come as soon as 2015, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Etemad, who has worked with some of the most influential families in the region, was appointed chief executive of the new Christie’s affiliate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’re targeting the very affluent,” said Mr. Wrang-Widén, and Mr. Etemad “is very well connected.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home building rebounded in September on the strength of apartment construction, a category that provides less of an economic boost than single-family homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts rose 6.3% in September from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.017 million units, the Commerce Department said Friday. Building permits, a bellwether of future construction, increased 1.5% last month to a 1.018 million rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had forecast housing starts would rise 4.6% last month and building permits would increase 2.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The underlying pace of housing starts continues to grind higher," RBS Marketplace economists wrote in a note to clients. But "it's been a volatile ride led by a booming multifamily sector and a single-family sector that is inching up at a glacial pace."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a sharp fall early in the year, starts did rebound to match a postrecession high of a 1.1 million annual rate in July before slipping in August. Starts in August fell 12.8% from July, a slightly smaller decline than initially estimated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family starts remain down 9% from the postrecession peak established in November 2013. Starts of properties with five or more units, mainly apartment buildings, have increased 22.7% so far this year, compared with the first nine months of 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That provides a lot less "bang for the buck given the smaller size and value of an average multifamily start versus single family," said <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> economist Ted Wieseman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newly started single-family units, roughly two-thirds of the market, rose just 1.1% in September. Permits for the category declined 0.5%. It has largely been a disappointing year for single-family construction, with starts up just 3.8% through the first nine months of the year, compared with the same period in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A decade ago, buildings with more than five units represented less than 20% of starts. Last month, the figure was 36%, showing increasing demand for apartments and other multifamily dwellings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As boomers and millennials look to higher-density housing, this segment is likely to be the key driving force for the sector for a while," said Joel Naroff, president and chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heading into 2014, there was hope that better job creation and still historically low interest rates would generate demand for new homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a cold winter stalled construction and buyers gravitated toward a growing inventory of existing homes, which tend to cost less. Sales of previously owned properties had increased for four straight months through July before falling slightly in August, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monte Hewett, chief executive of Georgia builder <span class="companylink">Monte Hewett Homes LLC</span>, started construction on 20 homes in September, slightly more than a year ago. Production was hindered, he said, by a shortage of lots ready for construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We moved through a lot of our existing [lot] positions quicker than we anticipated," Mr. Hewett said. "Our new lot positions are not quite in the ground yet."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Confidence among builders slipped in October as they grew more concerned about current sales conditions, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> said Thursday. More broadly, volatile financial markets and global concerns about the Ebola virus and Middle East turmoil are weighing on consumers' confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there are some factors supporting a stronger finish to the year for home building. The labor market has added more than 200,000 jobs on average each month this year and the unemployment rate fell to 5.9% in September, the lowest reading since 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower interest rates on mortgages could also boost demand for homes late in the year. The average interest rate on a 30-year mortgage fell to 3.97% this past week, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. It was the first time rates have fallen below 4% in more than a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But credit to buy a home is still difficult to attain for some consumers. "Mortgage credit really is, at this point, available really to those with pristine credit," Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen said last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colorado home builder <span class="companylink">Oakwood Homes LLC</span> started construction of 75 houses in its home state in September, up roughly 20% from a year earlier. Chief Executive Pat Hamill said he is seeing more entry-level homes under construction, but high prices are causing some buyers to balk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Pricing has expanded quite dramatically, and costs have, too," Mr. Hamill said. "That's kind of taken a little froth out of demand."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Candace Taylor </div><div>345 words</div><div>16 October 2014</div><div>10:08</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A house on nearly 7 acres in Miami’s Coconut Grove is set to list for $65 million, which would make it the most expensive home on the market in the Miami area, according to listing agent William P.D. Pierce of <span class="companylink">Coldwell Banker Residential Real Estate</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Known as “La Brisa,” the roughly 13,800-square-foot home has nine bedrooms, eight full bathrooms and three half-bathrooms, Mr. Pierce said. With about 200 feet of waterfront on Biscayne Bay, it has a private boat slip that can accommodate a 70-foot yacht. Originally built in the 1920s, the Mediterranean-style house underwent an extensive renovation and restoration starting in 2009. With balconies providing views of the Bay and the Atlantic Ocean, the house has much of its original woodwork and keystones intact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">La Brisa’s grounds include a two-bedroom guest cottage, a four-car garage with two bedrooms above it, a swimming pool and a sunken fire pit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pierce declined to identify the seller, but according to public records the owners are Simon and Tamara Decker, who purchased the property through an LLC in 2008 for $11.5 million. Mr. Decker is a co-founder of the Miami-based juice maker Raw Foods International. He didn’t respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agent Audrey Ross of EWM Realty International, who isn't involved in the listing, said La Brisa’s asking price is ambitious, since homes in Coconut Grove have yet to approach that price range. The highest-priced closed sale to date in the Miami area was the $47 million sale of an Indian Creek house in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pierce, who is also listing a home in Hillsboro Beach for $139 million, said the Miami market has appreciated significantly since the Indian Creek sale, and noted that La Brisa is located on an unusually large piece of land for the area. </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">U.S. Home-Builder Confidence Fell in October; Index Remained Above the 50-Point Threshold for a Fourth Consecutive Month</span>
</div><div class="author">By Ben Leubsdorf </div><div>562 words</div><div>16 October 2014</div><div>07:34</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A gauge of home-builder sentiment fell in October, the latest in a string of mixed signals for the U.S. housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index, which measures builder confidence in the market for new single-family homes, declined by five points to a seasonally adjusted level of 54 in October, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> said Thursday. A reading over 50 means most builders generally see positive conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index jumped in September to 59, its highest level since November 2005. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected the index would remain at that level in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">October marked the index’s first decline since May, though it remained above the 50-point threshold for a fourth consecutive month. “Historically low mortgage interest rates, steady job gains and significant pent-up demand all point to continued growth of the housing market,” said David Crowe, the trade group’s chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But U.S. home builders this month grew less confident about current sales conditions, expected future sales and traffic from prospective buyers. The index fell from September in all four regions of the country. At 54, October’s reading was unchanged from the same month a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While weaker than expected, “the October figure was not especially bad by the standards of this expansion,” <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span> economist Daniel Silver said in a note to clients. “We think the housing market will likely continue to improve over time, but the related indicators have been mixed lately and there will likely continue to be ups and downs in the data throughout the housing recovery.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a streak of strong growth in 2012 and the first half of 2013, the U.S. housing sector has hit turbulence over the past year, in part due to a jump last summer in mortgage rates. The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>, in a policy statement last month, reiterated its concern about the “slow” housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes were down 5.3% in August from a year earlier, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. Sales of newly built homes, which make up roughly 10% of the market, were up 2% in the first eight months of 2014 compared with the same period a year earlier, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growth in construction of multifamily housing, such as apartment buildings, has outpaced construction of traditional single-family homes. Overall housing starts rose 8.6% in the first eight months of the year compared with 2013. But new construction on single-family homes rose just 3.1%, and building permits for single-family homes were flat from a year earlier, according to Commerce Department data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Miami-based builder <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>. last month reported a boost in quarterly profits, aided by the sale of two apartment properties. “These sales demonstrate the earnings potential of a maturing business,” Chief Executive Stuart Miller told analysts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> analysts this week lowered their forecast for starts in 2015, “as we doubt that the dysfunction in the housing market will be resolved quickly enough to allow more than a 10% increase in sales volume next year,” they wrote in a report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAHB index released Thursday only gauges home-builder confidence in the single-family market.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Shelly Banjo </div><div>719 words</div><div>15 October 2014</div><div>15:40</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wal-Mart Stores Inc. appealed to investors for patience Wednesday, as it tries to retool its operations for shoppers who are buying more online and in smaller stores closer to home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The world’s largest retailer unveiled plans to slash the number of massive supercenters it plans to build in coming years in favor of investing more in e-commerce, which represents the fastest-growing part of its business but continues to generate operating losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company said its yearly e-commerce sales could approach $35 billion by early 2018, up from $10 billion last year. But it warned of a rough stretch for sales and profits as it plows ahead with its overhaul.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wal-Mart cut its forecast for sales growth in the current fiscal year to between 2% and 3% from a previous range of 3% to 5%, citing lower food-stamp payments and a stronger dollar, which eroded overseas gains when translated into its home currency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have the tolerance to think long term and to be patient,” Chief Executive Doug McMillon told investors. “It will put short-term pressure on the company, but we believe you and others will support it as long as you understand the strategy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Citing what it called a tougher-than-expected sales environment, the company said it hadn’t witnessed any change in the general weakness of the economy or its customer base, and that it doesn’t foresee much improvement next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Everywhere I travel, I see tough economies and stretched consumers, and that hasn’t changed through the course of the year,” Wal-Mart International Chief Executive David Cheesewright said Wednesday. The company expects sales to grow 2% to 4% next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wal-Mart’s shares fell 3.6% to $75.20 Wednesday, a rough day for markets overall. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 173 points on the day on mounting concerns about sluggish global growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The giant retailer has found itself on the wrong side of trends in the U.S., as shoppers favor smaller and more conveniently located stores or making purchases online. In response, Wal-Mart said Wednesday it would build only about half as many supercenters next year as this year and would shift investment dollars to e-commerce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We will change the mix of our capital spend through reductions in areas we have invested in historically to fund investments in new growth opportunities,” Mr. McMillon said. “Overall capital range will be slightly lower than last year with a mix difference toward more e-commerce dollars.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wal-Mart said it plans to build 60 to 70 supercenters and between 200 and 220 smaller stores next fiscal year. It aimed to build as many as 300 smaller-format stores this year, but said it would miss that target and now intends to complete 240.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the company plans to spend between $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion on e-commerce investments next year, up from $400 million last year. It said it will build two new 1.2 million-square-foot warehouses next year dedicated to handling Internet orders and speeding up shipments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two distribution centers, in Atlanta and Bethlehem, Pa., add to the three warehouses it built this year to process Web orders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The retailer hasn’t booked sales growth in the U.S., excluding newly opened or closed stores, since 2012, as its crowds of shoppers have dwindled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company has posted much better results for its 400 Neighborhood Markets, where sales rose by 5.6% in the quarter ended July 31, excluding newly opened or closed stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales at its 3,400 supercenters fell by 0.3% during the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wal-Mart’s Sam’s Club unit also will cut its store openings in half next year, planning to open nine to 12 stores next year, down from 20 this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wal-Mart said it would open fewer of its massive supercenters next year in the U.S. in favor of building out smaller-format stores and e-commerce. A previous version of this article said the company would open fewer of its massive supercenters this year.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Low Inflation Hampers China Debt Escape</span>
</div><div class="author">By Alex Frangos </div><div>453 words</div><div>15 October 2014</div><div>00:07</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deleveraging is hard to do when inflation isn’t on your side. For the indebted parts of China’s economy, that lesson is becoming clearer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China reported consumer prices rose a measly 1.6% in September from a year earlier, the slowest increase since just after the global financial crisis. Producer prices accelerated their decline, falling 1.8%, a reflection of subdued commodity markets and continued problems with overcapacity. China’s data will add to worries at the U.S. Federal Reserveand elsewhere about the state of the world economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may be unsurprising that China’s prices are tame, given the dour economic mood. Car sales have decelerated four months in a row. People are even drinking less beer. <span class="companylink">SABMiller</span>, co-owner with state-owned <span class="companylink">China Resources Enterprises</span> of “Snow” brand lager, the world’s biggest-selling beer, saw Asia-Pacific sales fall 8% by volume.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While low prices may be good for consumers, they can be a burden for corporate balance sheets. Inflation makes existing debt easier to pay as companies generate more cash by charging customers higher prices. The debt-to-equity ratio at 2,200 listed nonfinancial companies in China, compiled by <span class="companylink">Bank of America-Merrill Lynch</span>, rose to 53% by the middle of this year, from 34% at the end of 2010, around the time when China’s overall growth and inflation began to grind downward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among sectors in need of deleveraging, real estate rules. Developers’ business model is risky: Borrow heavily to buy land and build, and then sell apartments quickly. In cyclical fashion, debt levels swell and retreat as profits roll in. That has been upended as the selling part of the business model has been interrupted. The debt-to-equity ratio among these firms is now 95%, compared with a previous cycle peak of 68% in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In terms of pain relief from Beijing, companies will have to be satisfied with small doses. Coal import tariffs announced recently help the indebted mine sector. Cuts to short-term borrowing rates in money markets help companies roll over debt for now. Rules announced in September that allow faster depreciation on certain equipment reduce taxes and improve cash flow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will take worse news than the low inflation reading to move Beijing to try bigger tools, such as broad interest-rate cuts or the release of bank reserves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Communist Party</span> leaders, meanwhile, have sounded increasingly accepting of slower growth. Premier Li Keqiang said it was a “misunderstanding” that the 7.5% target for growth in gross domestic product is a “bottom line.” Companies will have to learn to live without the debt-eroding virtues of inflation.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Investors Ramp Up the Risk --- Boston Properties Sells Stakes in Existing Buildings in Broader Shift to Development</span>
</div><div class="author">By Eliot Brown   </div><div>914 words</div><div>15 October 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C10</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As foreign investors and pension funds push up prices for top-quality, low-vacancy office buildings, one of the nation's largest owners of existing office space is shifting gears.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Boston Properties Inc</span>., led by Chairman Mortimer Zuckerman, in the past 18 months has been cashing out of stakes in existing skyscrapers and funneling proceeds to new towers in San Francisco and Boston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rationale: While new projects carry a host of risks, from construction accidents to finding tenants, they also offer greater potential for returns in a tight market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Boston Properties</span>' new approach was on display in September when it struck a deal with the Norwegian Government Pension Fund Global to sell 45% stakes in a New York skyscraper and two Boston buildings for $1.5 billion, not including debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strategy shows how the global hunt for yield is rippling through the U.S. property market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign investors from East Asia, the Middle East, Norway and elsewhere have been dominating the acquisition market for top-quality skyscrapers, accepting low returns and high prices as they hunt for places to put their money. Values for office buildings in city centers in the second quarter were 10% higher than levels reached in the previous peak in 2007, while commercial-property values overall were on a par with 2007, according to the <span class="companylink">Moody's</span>/RCA Commercial Property Price Indices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, several publicly traded real-estate investment trusts such as <span class="companylink">Boston Properties</span> are piling into new projects offering better growth potential, even if it means more risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Most of the REITs are pivoting to development or heavy redevelopment as an investment strategy," said Jed Reagan, an analyst at <span class="companylink">Green Street Advisors Inc</span>. who follows office landlords. "There's so much aggressive capital out there that's looking for a home," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Boston Properties</span>' latest deal, for the buildings at 601 Lexington Ave. in Manhattan and 100 Federal St. and Atlantic Wharf in Boston, puts the company on track for more than $2 billion in property sales this year, up from $1.3 billion in 2013. At the same time, it had $3.5 billion of projects under development in the second quarter, including a San Francisco site that is to be the second-tallest tower west of the Mississippi River.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year earlier the company developed $2.5 billion of projects, its highest level in at least a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're certainly more bullish on development than buying buildings," Mr. Zuckerman said in an interview in his Midtown Manhattan office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Older buildings are trading at higher prices per square foot than where we can build," added Owen Thomas, the former <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> executive who became <span class="companylink">Boston Properties</span>' chief executive last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other firms making similar moves include Los Angeles-based <span class="companylink">Kilroy Realty Corp</span>., which has had success finding tenants for numerous office developments in California and Washington, and New York-based <span class="companylink">SL Green Realty Corp</span>., which has been buying empty buildings and is planning one of the city's tallest office buildings, its first major development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Brookfield Property Partners LP</span>, meanwhile, expects to seek buyers for a stake in the giant Brookfield Place complex in lower Manhattan -- formerly the World Financial Center -- and is planning a large development on Manhattan's far West Side called Manhattan West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ric Clark, Brookfield's chief executive, said at an investor conference last month the company was "selling into this wall of capital," and recycling the money into other investments including large-scale development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You make a lot of money in development," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Boston Properties</span> once was a highly aggressive buyer of iconic towers, paying $2.8 billion for the <span class="companylink">General Motors</span> building in Manhattan in 2008 and buying the John Hancock Tower in Boston for $930 million in 2010. But with the values of those and similar towers up considerably since, the company is pouring money into concrete and cranes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those efforts are concentrated in San Francisco, one of the nation's strongest office markets. <span class="companylink">Boston Properties</span> has taken on three developments there and Mr. Zuckerman said he wishes he had more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most notable project is a 1,070-foot tower in San Francisco. The project initially sparked concerns from some analysts given the size of the investment and the lack of tenants. But those risks were assuaged in April when <span class="companylink">Salesforce.com Inc</span>. agreed to lease the bottom half of the tower in the largest lease ever signed in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company has predicted the building's annual income ultimately will be more than 7% of its development cost. That yield is far more lucrative than the 3.8% initial yield that analysts estimate the Norwegian oil fund will see on its purchase of Boston's buildings, illustrating why the company is putting so much effort into development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Office developments are some of the riskiest property investments because if the economy sours, companies are often reluctant to sign pricey long-term leases, leaving landlords with empty buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boston executives say they are being prudent given the large amount of preleasing they have done and the large size of the company, with more than $30 billion of real estate. In addition, they have a long history of development, Mr. Zuckerman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is where we've got years of experience," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boston Properties Inc., led by Chairman Mortimer Zuckerman, in the past 18 months has been cashing out of stakes in existing skyscrapers and funneling proceeds to new towers in San Francisco and Boston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rationale: While new projects carry a host of risks, from construction accidents to finding tenants, they also offer greater potential for returns in a tight market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boston Properties’ new approach was on display in September when it struck a deal with the Norwegian Government Pension Fund Global to sell 45% stakes in a New York skyscraper and two Boston buildings for $1.5 billion, not including debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strategy shows how the global hunt for yield is rippling through the U.S. property market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign investors from East Asia, the Middle East, Norway and elsewhere have been dominating the acquisition market for top-quality skyscrapers, accepting low returns and high prices as they hunt for places to put their money. Values for office buildings in city centers in the second quarter were 10% higher than levels reached in the previous peak in 2007, while commercial-property values overall were on a par with 2007, according to the <span class="companylink">Moody’s</span>/RCA Commercial Property Price Indices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, several publicly traded real-estate investment trusts such as Boston Properties are piling into new projects offering better growth potential, even if it means more risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Most of the REITs are pivoting to development or heavy redevelopment as an investment strategy,” said Jed Reagan, an analyst at <span class="companylink">Green Street Advisors Inc</span>. who follows office landlords. “There’s so much aggressive capital out there that’s looking for a home,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boston Properties’ latest deal, for the buildings at 601 Lexington Ave. in Manhattan and 100 Federal St. and Atlantic Wharf in Boston, puts the company on track for more than $2 billion in property sales this year, up from $1.3 billion in 2013. At the same time, it had $3.5 billion of projects under development in the second quarter, including a San Francisco site that is to be the second-tallest tower west of the Mississippi River.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year earlier the company developed $2.5 billion of projects, its highest level in at least a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’re certainly more bullish on development than buying buildings,” Mr. Zuckerman said in an interview in his Midtown Manhattan office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Older buildings are trading at higher prices per square foot than where we can build,” added Owen Thomas, the former <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> executive who became Boston Properties’ chief executive last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other firms making similar moves include Los Angeles-based <span class="companylink">Kilroy Realty Corp</span>., which has had success finding tenants for numerous office developments in California and Washington, and New York-based <span class="companylink">SL Green Realty Corp</span>., which has been buying empty buildings and is planning one of the city’s tallest office buildings, its first major development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Brookfield Property Partners LP</span>, meanwhile, expects to seek buyers for a stake in the giant Brookfield Place complex in lower Manhattan—formerly the World Financial Center—and is planning a large development on Manhattan’s far West Side called Manhattan West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ric Clark, Brookfield’s chief executive, said at an investor conference last month the company was “selling into this wall of capital,” and recycling the money into other investments including large-scale development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You make a lot of money in development,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boston Properties once was a highly aggressive buyer of iconic towers, paying $2.8 billion for the <span class="companylink">General Motors</span> building in Manhattan in 2008 and buying the John Hancock Tower in Boston for $930 million in 2010. But with the values of those and similar towers up considerably since, the company is pouring money into concrete and cranes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those efforts are concentrated in San Francisco, one of the nation’s strongest office markets. Boston Properties has taken on three developments there and Mr. Zuckerman said he wishes he had more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most notable project is a 1,070-foot tower in San Francisco. The project initially sparked concerns from some analysts given the size of the investment and the lack of tenants. But those risks were assuaged in April when <span class="companylink">Salesforce.com Inc</span>. agreed to lease the bottom half of the tower in the largest lease ever signed in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company has predicted the building’s annual income ultimately will be more than 7% of its development cost. That yield is far more lucrative than the 3.8% initial yield that analysts estimate the Norwegian oil fund will see on its purchase of Boston’s buildings, illustrating why the company is putting so much effort into development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Office developments are some of the riskiest property investments because if the economy sours, companies are often reluctant to sign pricey long-term leases, leaving landlords with empty buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boston executives say they are being prudent given the large amount of preleasing they have done and the large size of the company, with more than $30 billion of real estate. In addition, they have a long history of development, Mr. Zuckerman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is where we’ve got years of experience,” he said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Chuin-Wei Yap   </div><div>667 words</div><div>14 October 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEIJING -- China's exports of steel products rose to a record last month, up sharply from a year earlier, as steelmakers boosted cheap sales abroad to make up for price cuts at home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese mills typically use exports as a means to bolster sagging domestic sales, a move that has often threatened to swamp global markets and led to trade friction with major importers, such as Europe and the U.S. Chinese steel officials say they are trying to get mills to cut back on such exports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">September net exports of steel products reached 7.2 million metric tons, rising 4.5% from the last high posted in May. Steel exports for the first nine months of the year are up 39% to 65.3 million tons. Net exports are exports less imports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By absolute volume, exports reached 8.5 million tons, also a record. September shipments rose 73% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. remains a top destination for Chinese steel exports. Weak manufacturing conditions and slack demand for steel spurred price cuts and exports among domestic steelmakers, according to Applied Value, a consulting firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cheap Chinese steel prices are boosting exports to record levels. In the U.S., domestic hot-rolled steel prices are $209 higher per ton, the firm said. Hot-rolled steel is used to make products such as cars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Past surges in Chinese steel exports have triggered disputes with the U.S., Europe and other trading partners, who say Beijing unfairly subsidizes its steel producers and sells products globally at below-market prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, Washington imposed preliminary tariffs of 159% on imports of Chinese grain-oriented electrical steel, which is used to make transformers. Last year, U.S. steelmakers filed 38 trade cases, the highest number of such complaints in more than a decade, calling for the government to impose higher tariffs and penalties on what they called unfairly traded steel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shandong Jingta Steel Co., a smaller firm that trades on behalf of producers, said it has seen exports rising among its clients on a level in line with the customs data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Domestic consumption has been declining since the start of the year, without much reduction in production. So as long as there's an opportunity to export, people will take it," said Wendy Qin, a manager at Jingta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state-backed <span class="companylink">China Iron and Steel Association</span> has called such measures protectionist, but at the same time has said it recognizes the problem and has been trying to persuade steelmakers -- a highly fragmented and far-flung quilt of regional producers -- to hold down cheap exports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The association has urged its members to favor higher value-added products over cheap construction steel. "As trade friction with China rises, China's exporters must adjust export policies," it said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Factory activity in China fell to a three-month low in August, prompting worries about a prolonged slowdown in the world's second-largest economy. While headline trade data Monday exceeded expectations, economists say they still worry about soft economic growth due in part to a slumping property market. The construction sector consumes half of China's steel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overcapacity continues to plague the Chinese steel industry. Domestic demand for steel is waning, which compounds the problem of excessive production capacity, said Applied Value analyst Jason Yang.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's crude steel production in the first eight months is up 2.6% at 550 million tons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five-year lows in prices of iron ore, the key raw material for steel, also are spurring Chinese mills to produce. September iron-ore imports rose 14% from a year earlier to 85 million tons. As global miners open new lines of supply, iron ore for delivery to the Chinese port of Tianjin reached $80 a ton last Friday, down 40% from the beginning of the year.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Craig Karmin </div><div>652 words</div><div>6 October 2014</div><div>13:50</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc</span>. is selling its flagship hotel, the historic Waldorf Astoria in Manhattan, for $1.95 billion, illustrating the heated competition—particularly among foreigners—for famous luxury properties that only a few years ago struggled to fill their rooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Waldorf sale, to <span class="companylink">Anbang Insurance Group Co</span>. of China, carries the steepest price tag ever for a U.S. hotel, brokers say, although it isn’t the highest on a per-room basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anbang is paying about $1.4 million per room. Asian buyers in recent years have acquired the <span class="companylink">Plaza Hotel</span> and the Carlyle Hotel at prices that exceeded $1.4 million-a-room, according to hotel data tracker STR Analytics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not long ago, $1 million per room was considered the high-water mark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Waldorf, which opened in 1931, has 1,413 rooms and covers a full city block on Park Avenue, making the Art Deco landmark one of the largest luxury hotels in the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Former president Herbert Hoover and celebrities from Cole Porter to Gen. Douglas MacArthur have called the Waldorf home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hilton will continue to operate the Waldorf under a 100-year management contract that begins when the sale closes. Hotel analysts say the pact is about five times the length of a typical luxury hotel-management deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conrad Hilton acquired the hotel and the management contract for the Waldorf in 1949 for $3 million, Hilton officials said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anbang couldn’t be reached for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese buyers, who view high-quality U.S. real estate as a haven for their savings, have led the charge in the race to snap up prestige properties. About a year ago, Shanghai-based conglomerate <span class="companylink">Fosun International Ltd</span>. bought the 60-story One Chase Manhattan Plaza building for $725 million, while a Chinese developer was part of a buying group that landed a stake in New York’s General Motors Building last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese insurers, meanwhile, are taking advantage of the government’s recent easing of rules governing the buying of real estate abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scramble for high-end properties has pushed up valuations, and some owners believe prices are near a peak, at least in the short term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luxury hotels were hard hit during the downturn, as companies shied away from putting up employees in lavish quarters. That stigma has faded and in recent months business and rewards travel has snapped back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I wouldn’t be surprised to see a flurry of activity continue in the luxury end, especially when [potential sellers] see the pricing for the Waldorf and think that we may be near a peak,” says Sean Hennessey, chief executive officer of Lodging Advisors, a hotel consulting firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hilton plans to use the proceeds to acquire other properties, in large part to avoid a hefty tax bill on this transaction, said people familiar with Hilton’s thinking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale ends a monthslong process in which Hilton explored various ways to wring more money out of the Waldorf.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company considered converting hundreds of Waldorf rooms into luxury condominiums, according to people familiar with the property. In recent weeks, however, Hilton decided to pursue a sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But before the hotel company could begin the formal marketing process, Anbang and at least two competing groups offered bids around the $2 billion mark, these people said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is unclear if Anbang plans to convert any of the rooms to private condos, but the insurer is expected to invest in upgrading the infrastructure of the 83-year-old property. The deal is scheduled to close by year’s end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Waldorf sale continues the trend of large U.S. hotel operators, including <span class="companylink">Marriott International Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts Worldwide Inc</span>., selling properties to focus instead on franchising agreements and hotel-management contracts.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employers' rising confidence in the economy and their determination to woo skilled workers with hip office environments fueled increased rents and competition for prime Manhattan space during the third quarter, brokers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan's office-vacancy rate at September's end stood at 9.7% -- its lowest level since the third quarter of 2008, according to real estate services firm JLL.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall average asking rents also rose, climbing to $64.91 a square foot, up less than 1% from the midyear but a 6.2% increase from the third quarter of 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Companies generally are doing better so they have capital now and confidence to make moves," said Peter Riguardi, JLL president of the New York tri-state region. "The battle for talent and balance for the work-live lifestyle is so apparent in the decisions for real estate right now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Increases in asking rents for two of the three major office submarkets were slight, but brokers noted that prices continued on their upward trend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Midtown South's vacancy rate fell to 6.7% in the third quarter from 7.7% in the previous quarter. The area's average asking rent fell to $58.83 a square foot from $60.09 at midyear, as new deals removed some of the higher-priced offices from the market, according to JLL.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Midtown's vacancy rate declined to 10.1%, and average asking rents grew less than 1% in the second quarter to $70.29. Lower Manhattan's vacancy rate fell to 10.6% from 12.1% in the previous quarter, as average asking rates increased slightly, from $52.85 a square foot to $53.12.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the larger new deals signed in the third quarter: law firm <span class="companylink">Paul Hastings LLP</span>'s move to 180,000 square feet in the MetLife Building; and digital advertising firm R/GA Media Group Inc.'s decision to take 173,000 square feet at <span class="companylink">Brookfield Property Partners LP</span>'s Hudson Yards District development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retailer <span class="companylink">Hudson's Bay Co</span>., the parent of <span class="companylink">Saks Fifth Avenue</span>, signed leases to consolidate its New York offices downtown in about 400,000 square feet at Brookfield Place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New leases rather than renewals made up much of the deal activity throughout the year, said Donald N. Noland Jr., managing director of tri-state research at real estate services firm <span class="companylink">Cushman &amp; Wakefield Inc</span>. Average new lease transactions exceeded 2 million square feet for each of the past 13 months, breaking the previous record of 12 consecutive months in 2010 and 2011, according to Cushman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renewals tend to happen during soft economic times or periods of recovery. Over the past year large tenants have been on the move -- in part to attract new employees and keep old ones, Mr. Noland said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through the third quarter, new leases totaled 24.4 million square feet. The year is on track to surpass the 30.1 million square feet of new leasing in 2011, a once-in-a-decade year, Mr. Noland said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This strong growth in occupied space is driven in part by the return of the megadeal," Mr. Noland said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While much of the leasing was for the highest-quality space, offices considered in the lower-tier category, class B, also have fared well. At 28 W. 44th St. in the Grand Central area, APF Properties has seen rents rise 10% to 15% as a result of both an improving real-estate market and upgrades to the 1920s-era tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One tenant in the building was looking for spaces in Midtown South but reversed course and stayed because of escalating rents in that market, said Berndt Perl, principal of APF Properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Midtown South class B rents are higher than Midtown, Mr. Perl said. So Midtown is a pretty good deal compared to Midtown South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The downtown rental market has bolstered sales of office property, with many buyers opting to retain them as commercial space. Sales of office buildings 200,000 square feet and larger hit 9.3 million square feet, worth about $3.5 billion in the third quarter, according to <span class="companylink">Newmark Grubb Knight Frank</span>. The three-year annual average is 5.8 million square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is now a destination rather than an alternative that was purely price driven," said Hal Stein, executive vice president and managing director at <span class="companylink">Newmark Grubb Knight Frank</span>.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Josh Barbanel   </div><div>935 words</div><div>4 October 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A15</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A fear of annual mansion taxes on the wealthy, many of them foreigners, is causing ripples in luxury housing markets on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In London, an Italian hedge-fund executive withdrew an offer a few weeks ago for a 4,000-square-foot home in the prime Knightsbridge neighborhood listed for about GBP 20 million ($32 million).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was worried, said his broker, Charles McDowell, about a proposal floated by the opposition Labour Party to raise nearly GBP 1.2 billion ($2 billion) through a new annual tax on the value of high-price homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York City, broker Caroline Guthrie of Brown Harris Stevens said she saw a sale fall apart between her Brazilian buyers and the owner of a $30 million Park Avenue co-op.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The breakdown, Ms. Guthrie said, followed remarks by Mayor Bill de Blasio that he was evaluating a plan to impose an annual property-tax surcharge on expensive pied-a-terres.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The buyers have been advised by their financial people that it is not wise to proceed while this in on the table," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Guthrie said other potential buyers raised similar worries spurred by their lawyers, accountants and advisers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But brokers and other lawyers say the uncertainty in the New York and London markets may be worse than the actual bite of whatever new taxes are adopted -- if any.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few years ago, when a wave of new less onerous taxes hit the luxury international home market in London, sales stalled briefly but rebounded and now are as strong as ever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices rose after these taxes were imposed but more modestly than before. Prices on expensive homes across England and Wales rose also more slowly than lower-priced homes not facing the higher taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent decades, and especially since the financial crisis of 2008, luxury homes in both New York and London have been seen by international buyers as a haven for their assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartment prices have set new records in New York and prices for London properties near the top of the market soared to 31.8% above the 2008 peak, according to data from <span class="companylink">Knight Frank LLP</span>, a global real-estate company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the flow of wealth has changed neighborhoods and has made the wealthy more of a target for tax collectors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is the same trend," said Liam Bailey, global head of residential research at a Knight Frank. "London and New York are being more internationalized. Locals get pushed out as the market becomes more unaffordable."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2011, the United Kingdom increased a one-time real estate transfer tax to 5% on properties valued at more than GBP 1 million ($1.6 million).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The following year, the top rate of the levy, known as the stamp duty land tax, was set at 7% for properties valued at more than GBP 2 million ($3.2 million), with a rate of 15% for many high-price residential properties owned by offshore and other corporate entities, in an effort to cut down on tax avoidance and evasion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Capital-gains taxes also were approved for both corporations and foreign homeowners who don't pay local taxes. They pay a similar federal tax in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increases were seen as a "massive attack on mostly foreigners or as we call them non-domiciliaries," said Charles Hutton, a partner at <span class="companylink">Speechly Bircham</span>, a London law firm who works with wealthy individuals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new tax regime also sowed confusion and worry about the impact on the market. Buyers rushed to close before changes took effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others stopped using corporations to buy houses. But it didn't turn out to be the disaster that he said everyone expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The last couple of years the London market has continued to roar away," he said. "A lot of people just regard the London market as such a good investment that even with a bit of tax on it is still pretty good."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New York tax, under a bill introduced Monday in Albany, would impose an annual tax on a sliding scale beginning at 0.5% for the value of properties over $5 million, up to 4% for more than $25 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Parrott, deputy director and chief economist at the Fiscal Policy Institute, a left-leaning research group that proposed the new tax, said the middle class was being priced out in both New York and London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said that even if the new taxes had some "restraining effect on prices on the high end" in the United Kingdom, "it doesn't seem like it has destroyed the market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But brokers and developers in both London and New York say they worry that proposals for annual taxes could have more impact on buyer behavior than one time transfer tax like the stamp duty tax in the U.K.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transfer taxes by New York City and New York state are 2.8% for properties that sell for $1 million or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Gilbert-Green, a broker and partner at <span class="companylink">Strutt &amp; Parker</span> in London, said that prices in London already have stalled "as a direct result of a lack of certainty in the market on the future taxes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even multimillionaires and billionaires with multiple homes who are willing to pay large sums for another home, don't like to be told they will have to pay extra taxes every year, Ms. Guthrie said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is not appealing," she said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The buyers have been advised by their financial people that it is not wise to proceed while this in on the table,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Guthrie said other potential buyers raised similar worries spurred by their lawyers, accountants and advisers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But brokers and other lawyers say the uncertainty in the New York and London markets may be worse than the actual bite of whatever new taxes are adopted—if any.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few years ago, when a wave of new less onerous taxes hit the luxury international home market in London, sales stalled briefly but rebounded and now are as strong as ever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices rose after these taxes were imposed but more modestly than before. Prices on expensive homes across England and Wales rose also more slowly than lower-priced homes not facing the higher taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent decades, and especially since the financial crisis of 2008, luxury homes in both New York and London have been seen by international buyers as a haven for their assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartment prices have set new records in New York and prices for London properties near the top of the market soared to 31.8% above the 2008 peak, according to data from <span class="companylink">Knight Frank LLP</span>, a global real-estate company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the flow of wealth has changed neighborhoods and has made the wealthy more of a target for tax collectors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is the same trend,” said Liam Bailey, global head of residential research at a Knight Frank. “London and New York are being more internationalized. Locals get pushed out as the market becomes more unaffordable.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2011, the United Kingdom increased a one-time real estate transfer tax to 5% on properties valued at more than £1 million ($1.6 million).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The following year, the top rate of the levy, known as the stamp duty land tax, was set at 7% for properties valued at more than £2 million ($3.2 million), with a rate of 15% for many high-price residential properties owned by offshore and other corporate entities, in an effort to cut down on tax avoidance and evasion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Capital-gains taxes also were approved for both corporations and foreign homeowners who don’t pay local taxes. They pay a similar federal tax in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increases were seen as a “massive attack on mostly foreigners or as we call them non-domiciliaries,” said Charles Hutton, a partner at <span class="companylink">Speechly Bircham</span>, a London law firm who works with wealthy individuals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new tax regime also sowed confusion and worry about the impact on the market. Buyers rushed to close before changes took effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others stopped using corporations to buy houses. But it didn't turn out to be the disaster that he said everyone expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The last couple of years the London market has continued to roar away,” he said. “A lot of people just regard the London market as such a good investment that even with a bit of tax on it is still pretty good.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New York tax, under a bill introduced Monday in Albany, would impose an annual tax on a sliding scale beginning at 0.5% for the value of properties over $5 million, up to 4% for more than $25 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Parrott, deputy director and chief economist at the <span class="companylink">Fiscal Policy Institute</span>, a left-leaning research group that proposed the new tax, said the middle class was being priced out in both New York and London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said that even if the new taxes had some “restraining effect on prices on the high end” in the United Kingdom, “it doesn’t seem like it has destroyed the market.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But brokers and developers in both London and New York say they worry that proposals for annual taxes could have more impact on buyer behavior than one time transfer tax like the stamp duty tax in the U.K.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transfer taxes by New York City and New York state are 2.8% for properties that sell for $1 million or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Gilbert-Green, a broker and partner at <span class="companylink">Strutt &amp; Parker</span> in London, said that prices in London already have stalled “as a direct result of a lack of certainty in the market on the future taxes.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even multimillionaires and billionaires with multiple homes who are willing to pay large sums for another home, don’t like to be told they will have to pay extra taxes every year, Ms. Guthrie said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is not appealing,” she said</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. consumers unexpectedly pulled back on their economic optimism in September, while the yearly growth in home prices nationwide slowed more than anticipated in midsummer, according to two reports released Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span>, a private research group, said its index of consumer confidence dipped to 86.0 in September from a revised 93.4 in August, first reported as 92.4.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The August index was the highest reading since October 2007, before the last recession started. The September drop puts confidence back to its lowest reading since May. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had forecast the latest index to edge up to 92.8.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The present situation index, a gauge of consumers' assessment of current economic conditions, dropped to 89.4 this month from a revised 93.9 in August, originally put at 94.6.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> pointed to worries about the labor markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A less positive assessment of the current job market, most likely due to the recent softening in growth, was the sole reason for the decline in consumers' assessment of present-day conditions," said Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the housing front, the home-price index covering the U.S. increased 5.6% in the 12 months that ended in July, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is down from 6.3% in June. <span class="companylink">Nationwide</span>, home prices were rising at double-digit yearly rates as recently as February 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home-price index covering 10 major U.S. cities increased 6.7% in the year that ended in July. The 20-city price index also was up 6.7%, less than the 7.3% expected by economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On an unadjusted basis, the national index increased 0.5% in July over June, while the 10-city index and the 20-city composite each increased 0.6%. Seasonally adjusted, the U.S. index increased 0.2% in July, the 10-city gauge and the 20-city composite each fell 0.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While the year-over-year figures are trending downward, home prices are still rising month-to-month although at a slower rate than what we are used to seeing over the past couple of years," said David M. Blitzer, chairman of the Index Committee at <span class="companylink">S&amp;P</span><span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> Indices. "The rise in August new home sales -- which are not covered by the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller indices -- is a welcome exception to recent trends."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The yearly growth in home prices across the U.S. slowed more than expected in the middle of summer, according to a home price report released Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home-price index covering the entire nation increased 5.6% in the 12 months ended in July, said the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index report. That is down from 6.3% in June. U.S. home prices were rising at double-digit yearly rates as recently as February 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home-price index covering 10 major U.S. cities increased just 6.7% in the year ended in July. The 20-city price index was also up 6.7%, less than the 7.3% expected by economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On an unadjusted basis, the national index increased 0.5% in July over June, while the 10-city index and the 20-city composite each increased 0.6%. Seasonally adjusted, the U.S. index increased 0.2% in July, the 10-city gauge and the 20-city composite each fell 0.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While the year-over-year figures are trending downward, home prices are still rising month-to-month although at a slower rate than what we are used to seeing over the past couple of years," said David M. Blitzer, Chairman of the Index Committee at <span class="companylink">S&amp;P</span><span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> Indices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The slower pace of home price appreciation is consistent with most of the other housing data on housing starts and home sales," he said. "The rise in August new home sales--which are not covered by the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller indices--is a welcome exception to recent trends."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regionally, cities in the south and west that saw the largest price cuts during the recession, are seeing some of the strongest price increases now. But even in areas like Las Vegas and Miami, the yearly gains have slowed.</p>
