<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Business investment, housing and consumer confidence in the U.S. all
showed surprising and widespread improvement, adding to the evidence an
end to the recession could be in sight.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In a wave of economic indicators released Friday, orders for new
capital equipment rose in November after a similar gain in October -- a
hopeful sign since slumping business spending has been a dominant
characteristic of the current recession. Other positives included a big
jump in consumer confidence in December, stronger sales of both new and
existing homes in November, and a third straight week of relatively slow
growth in unemployment insurance claims.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"What we're beginning to see more and more is that the sharpest
contractions are over, and we're starting to build for an economic
recovery in the spring," said Steven A. Wood, chief economist for
FinancialOxygen Inc., a financial services firm based in Walnut Creek,
California.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Orders for durable goods, which are designed to last three or more
years, fell 4.8% in November, the Commerce Department said, after
surging a record 12.8% in October. But that swing was dominated by
defense orders. In October, early bookings associated with the $200
billion Joint Strike Fighter contract to Lockheed Martin Corp., helped
send defense orders up 218% in October. In November, they fell back to
Earth, plummeting 70%. Excluding the volatile defense sector, November
orders were up for the second consecutive month, rising 2.7% on top of
October's 4.8% gain.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Orders for nondefense capital goods, a crucial indicator of business
investment, rose 4.8% in November, after increasing 5.9% in October.
Technology orders were up 2%; motor vehicles rose 4.5%; electrical
equipment increased 2.6%; and machinery gained 2.4%. Additionally,
inventories fell 1.1% in November, leading Thomas J. Duesterberg,
president and chief executive officer of the Arlington, Virginia-based
Manufacturers Alliance, to predict a recovery by spring. "Inventories
have been pared back so much that production is likely to pick up even
more as we enter the new year," he said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Many analysts, however, noted that civilian durable-goods orders
remained below the pre-Sept. 11 pace, and said a rebound may not be
imminent. "It's still too early to know whether the manufacturing sector
is bouncing back for real," Mark Vitner, economist for Wachovia
Securities, said in a report.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Nonetheless, economists noted other positive signs. The Conference
Board's index of consumer confidence jumped to 93.7 this month from 84.9
in November, putting it near pre-Sept. 11 levels. The increase was in
line with results of the University of Michigan's index of consumer
sentiment, which jumped to 88.8 this month from 83.9 in November. The
Conference Board said the December rise was driven by a sharp jump in
the expectations index, which measures consumers' feelings about the
future.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The improvement in consumer sentiment could be the product of a
stabilizing job market. Initial claims for unemployment benefits rose by
7,000 last week to 392,000, the Labor Department said. It was the third
consecutive week that new jobless claims remained below 400,000, the
level above which some analysts say overall employment starts to
contract, and significantly below the 535,000 new claims reported the
last week of September. The four-week moving average, a less volatile
measure, continued to drop, to 413,000, from 439,000 the week before --
the lowest level since Sept. 15.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Meanwhile, the housing market continues to defy the recession, helped
by low interest rates and mild weather in much of the U.S. The average
fixed rate for a 30-year mortgage was 6.66% in November, more than a
point lower than the average rate a year earlier. The National
Association of Realtors reported Friday that existing-home sales could
possibly break the record of 5.21 million units set in 1999. November
sales matched that pace, the association said, up 0.6% from a 5.18
million pace in October. New-home sales rose jumped to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 934,000 units, up 6.4% from 878,000 in October,
the Commerce Department reported.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
However, the construction industry continues to lose some momentum, as
construction starts fell 3% in November, according to the latest report
from F.W. Dodge. The value of new-construction contracts fell to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $478.2 billion, owing to a decline in
housing and public-works projects, said F.W. Dodge, a building-research
division of publisher McGraw-Hill Cos. Nonresidential buildings showed
improvement for the third month in a row, the report said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"The November figures point toward a construction industry that
continues to settle back gradually from its heightened performance at
the outset of 2001," said Robert A. Murray, vice president of economic
affairs for F.W. Dodge.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Dodge Index, a measure of national construction value that uses
1996 as a base year of 100, was at 144 for November, down from 148 in

Construction Starts Fell 3% in November
On Decline in Housing and Public Works

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Construction starts fell 3% in November, indicating the industry
continues to lose some momentum.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The value of new-construction contracts fell to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of $478.2 billion, due to a decline in housing and
public-works projects, according to the latest report from F.W. Dodge, a
building-research division of publisher McGraw-Hill Cos. Nonresidential
buildings showed improvement for the third month in a row, the report
said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"The November figures point toward a construction industry that
continues to settle back gradually from its heightened performance at
the outset of 2001," said Robert A. Murray, vice president of economic
affairs for F.W. Dodge. "It's important to note that the loss of
momentum for total construction has been very mild, as a result of an
offsetting pattern by the industry's major sectors."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
When commercial building declined during the first half of 2001, Mr.
Murray said, some of the shortfall was picked up by high-level activity
for housing, public works and power plants. Now, he said, housing and
public works appear to be slipping back, but the institutional building
sector, namely school construction, continues to be strong.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Dodge Index, a measure of national construction value that uses
1996 as a base year of 100, was at 144 for November, down from 148 in
October. The index began the year at 153 but weakened during the summer,
the report said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Residential building in November dropped 5% to $202.6 billion compared
with the prior month. Single-family housing fell 6% in dollar volume,
while multifamily housing remained steady. "For most of 2001,
single-family housing has been able to hold up quite well, as low
mortgage rates have countered the negatives of weak consumer confidence
and rising layoffs," Mr. Murray said. "However, it now appears that
these negatives are beginning to have a greater dampening effect, which
means that single-family housing will likely see a continued retreat in
the next few months."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Nonbuilding construction fell 18% to $91.1 billion. A 30% decline was
reported for public works such as highways, bridges, sewers and
water-supply systems, but Mr. Murray pointed out that the sector is
subject to occasional volatility month by month. He said November should
be viewed as a "correction" that brings public works more in line with
the 6% increase reported by the sector for the first 11 months of 2001.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Nonresidential building grew by 10% to $184.5 billion. The
institutional side of the nonresidential market -- schools, courthouses,
detention facilities, health-care facilities and amusement-related
projects -- was strong, the report said. On the commercial side,
warehouse construction fell 8% and hotel construction fell 36%. However,
construction of stores and shopping centers rose 9%, while office
construction rose 26%.

U.S. Stocks Strengthen on GE Outlook

Surge in November Housing Starts Also Boosts Shares

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Blue-chip stocks led the market higher Tuesday as investors cheered an
encouraging earnings forecast from General Electric and a surge in
November housing starts.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The advance put the Dow Jones Industrial Average just shy of 10000 and
pushed the Nasdaq Composite Index back above 2000. Both had captured
those milestones weeks ago but retreated amid continued uncertainty
about the timing of a recovery in the economy and corporate profits.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Dow industrials closed up 106.42 at 9998.39, after gaining 80.82
in the previous session. The Nasdaq composite advanced 17.31 to 2004.76,
after advancing 34.28 on Monday.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Other indexes also rose Tuesday. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index
edged up 8.56 to 1142.92, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index
moved up 4.71 to 580.56 and the Russell 2000 Index inched up 5.55 to
485.49.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Bonds rose and the dollar was mixed.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
After the closing bell on Monday, GE said it is comfortable with
analysts' fourth-quarter earnings estimates and anticipates profit
growth of 17% to 18% in 2002, despite the recession. The company's
stock, a component of the industrial average, led the index higher and
was up 4.2%.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Alan Ackerman, executive vice president and market strategist at
Fahnestock &amp; Co., said GE's announcement was the excuse many investors
needed to put some money to work.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"Investors seem to be perked up by the GE projections -- they don't
need a lot of good news to pique their interest," Mr. Ackerman said.
"There's so much money on the sidelines looking for long-term
opportunities."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A stronger-than-expected report on new-home construction for November
also fueled buying. The Commerce Department said that U.S. housing
starts surged 8.2% to 1.65 million last month from 1.52 million in
October.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The report also showed that the number of building permits, an
indication of future building activity, totaled 1.56 million in
November, compared with 1.48 million a month earlier. Economists
surveyed by Thomson Global Markets expected 1.54 million housing starts
in November and 1.5 million building permits.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Among individual stocks, Best Buy was up 3.8% after the company said
third-quarter profit soared 40%, driven by strong sales of digital and
video-game products, and new store openings. The consumer-electronics
retailer also issued an optimistic outlook for its fourth quarter and
the year.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Competitor Circuit City saw its shares edge higher after the company
swung to a profit for its third quarter as increased advertising boosted
traffic at the electronics-retail chain.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Meanwhile, the U.S. Justice Department dealt a blow to British
Airways' efforts to form an alliance with AMR's American Airlines,
saying the deal should be scaled back to protect competition. British
Airways shares were up 5%; AMR shares were down slightly.

U.S. Housing Starts
Return to Levels
Of Before Sept. 11

November's Increase of 8.2%
Was Busiest Month Since July

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The U.S. housing market continued to show its resilience in November
as home-construction activity rebounded to pre-Sept. 11 levels.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Commerce Department said builders broke ground on homes at a
seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.65 million units in November, an
8.2% increase over October and the busiest month for home construction
since July.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The gain was led primarily by a 28% surge in multifamily construction,
but starts for single-family homes, a larger and more important part of
the housing sector, also were stronger than expected, rising 3.2% after
a 3.4% drop in October. Permits for new homes, a good indicator of
future construction activity, rose 5.3% in November to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 1.56 million units.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"There's very little evidence of a downturn in housing," said David
Berson, the chief economist at mortgage concern Fannie Mae. Indeed,
despite fears that the market was poised to fall apart after Sept. 11,
"housing is holding up," said Gerald Cohen, a senior economist at New
York investment bank Merrill Lynch.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Economists said warm weather helped boost the numbers, as did the
recent uptick in interest rates, which appears to be encouraging some
home shoppers to buy now in case rates go higher. The average rate for a
30-year fixed-rate mortgage bottomed out at 6.45% in early November,
according to Freddie Mac; last week, the average rate was 7.09%, which
is still low by historical standards. Many economists say they expect
home sales to slow a bit as the weather gets colder, but the current
consensus is that sales will remain relatively strong well into next
year.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The healthy housing starts data are only the latest in a steady stream
of encouraging reports on the housing market in recent days. Monday, the
National Association of Home Builders said its monthly survey of builder
sentiment rose eight points in December, the largest monthly increase
since 1998. Meanwhile, applications for mortgages to purchase homes have
shot up in recent weeks to levels not seen since the summer, when home
sales were running at a record pace, the Mortgage Bankers Association of
America said.

November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.56 million units.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"There's very little evidence of a downturn in housing," said David
Berson, the chief economist at Fannie Mae. Indeed, despite recent fears
that the market was poised to fall apart after Sept. 11, "housing is
holding up," said Gerald Cohen, a senior economist at Merrill Lynch.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Economists said warm weather helped to boost the numbers, as did the
recent uptick in interest rates, which appears to be encouraging some
home shoppers to buy now before rates go higher.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage bottomed out at
6.45% in early November, according to Freddie Mac; last week, the
average rate was 7.09%, which is still low by historical standards. Many
economists say they expect home sales to slow a bit as the weather gets
colder, but the current consensus is that sales will remain relatively
strong well into next year.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The healthy housing starts data are only the latest in a steady stream
of encouraging reports on the housing market in recent days. On Monday,
the National Association of Home Builders said its monthly survey of
builder sentiment rose eight points in December, the largest monthly
increase since 1998. Meanwhile, applications for mortgages to purchase
homes have shot upward in recent weeks to levels not seen since this
summer, when home sales were running at a record pace, the Mortgage
Bankers Association of America said.

U.S. Housing Starts Rise 8.2%,
Outpacing Analysts' Forecasts
---
Gain is Biggest Monthly Increase Since January

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON -- U.S. home-building activity rebounded in November as
housing starts posted their biggest one-month gain since January.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
U.S. housing starts overall rose 8.2% for the month to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 1.6 million, the Commerce Department said. The
November rise follows a revised 4% decline in October to a 1.5 million
annual rate. October housing starts previously were reported to have
slid 1.3%.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The November data are much stronger than Wall Street anticipated.
Economists surveyed by Thomson Global Markets predicted housing starts
would slide 0.8%. Some economists had expected unusually warm weather in
November to boost starts, but few analysts expected such a large monthly
gain.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
While housing remains the strongest sector of the U.S. economy,
economists expect the market to soften in coming months. Mortgage rates
have been at 30-year lows, but rates have started edging up as investors
in bonds have grown more optimistic that the end of the recession is
near. The 30-year mortgage rates rose to a five-month high last week of
7.09%.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Another bad omen for the housing market is a continued rise in
unemployment. The jobless rate is at a six-year high of 5.7% and is
expected to climb to more than 6.5% by June. Job worries may keep
consumers from shelling out the money necessary to buy a new home,
economists say.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Building permits, an indication of future building activity, rose 5.3%
in November after falling a revised 2.8% in October. Building permits
previously were reported as falling 3.6% in October.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The report showed that single-family housing starts rose 3.2% in
November, while housing starts on multifamily units and apartment
buildings surged 30%.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
By region, housing starts rose 20% in the Northeast, 21% in the
Midwest and  13% in the West. Housing starts fell 1.6% in the South.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Separately, Redbook Research's latest indicator of U.S. retail sales
showed sales fell 4.6% in the first two retailing weeks of December from
the same period in November. The report also showed that seasonally
adjusted sales fell 1.1% from the year-earlier period.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Redbook said that on an unadjusted basis, sales in the week ended Dec.
15 fell 1.2% from the year-earlier week. Redbook added that performance
slowed a bit in the second week of December, although most retailers'
sales went according to plan. Department stores and discount stores had
slower sales growth than in the previous week.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The report said sales growth is expected to be strongest this week and
next, as consumers continue to delay purchases until right before
Christmas.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
U.S. stocks advanced as investors reacted to an encouraging earnings
forecast from General Electric, along with a surge in November housing
starts.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In midmorning trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 87
points at 9979, after gaining 80.82 points on Monday. The Nasdaq
Composite Index was ahead 15.10 points at 2002.50, after rising 34.28
points on Monday.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Other indexes also gained ground. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock
index edged up 9.10 points to 1143.50, the New York Stock Exchange
Composite Index moved up 4.40 points to 580.20 and the Russell 2000
Index edged up 3.90 points to 483.90.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Bond prices rose and the dollar was stronger.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
After the closing bell on Monday, GE said it is comfortable with
analysts' fourth-quarter earnings estimates and anticipates profit
growth of 17% to 18% in 2002, despite the recession. The company's
stock, a component of the Dow Jones industrials, gained 4.1%.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A stronger-than-expected report on new-home construction for November
also fueled buying. The Commerce Department said U.S. housing starts
surged 8.2% to 1.645 million last month from 1.521 million in October.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The report also showed that the number of building permits, an
indication of future building activity, totaled 1.564 million in
November, compared with 1.485 million a month earlier. Economists
surveyed by Thomson Global Markets expected to see 1.54 million housing
starts for November and 1.5 million building permits.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The U.S. Justice Department dealt a blow to British Airways' efforts
to form an alliance with AMR's American Airlines, saying the deal should
be scaled back to protect competition. British Airways shares climbed
3.7%; AMR shares were up slightly.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Moody's Investors Service Inc. downgraded Boeing's long-term senior
debt rating, saying the aviation crisis in the wake of the Sept. 11
attacks will hurt the aerospace company's earnings and cash flow. Boeing
shares edged higher.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
On the New York Stock Exchange, where 219.8 million shares traded,
1,796 stocks rose and 800 fell. On the Nasdaq Stock Market, 368.4
million shares changed hands.

Advantage: Buyers

With Housing Sales Slow, Buyers
Demand Deals, Fancy Extras;
A Sub-Zero and 0% Down

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
CHRIS AND GLORIA MOSER recently made a rock-bottom deal with 0% down
and 0% closing costs. Were they buying a new Toyota Camry? No, try a
three-bedroom custom-built home in Cleveland, Tenn. "I know what I
want," says Mrs. Moser, an accountant, who also got the builder to throw
in the first year's hazard-insurance payment.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
These days, the nation's home buyers may finally have the one thing
they haven't had in almost a decade: the upper hand. In a small but
growing number of markets, they're pushing sellers and new home builders
not only to lower prices but also to throw in cut-rate financing, fancy
appliances, even gift certificates to malls. In Los Angeles, one
developer is giving granite countertops and a Sub-Zero fridge at no
extra cost, while a Houston builder has agreed to give out discounts on
golf-club memberships.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"People are asking for the moon -- and getting it," says Gertrude
Gregorio, a Union City, Calif., real-estate agent.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Not all of this is surprising, of course, given the shaky economy and
the aftermath of Sept. 11. But few analysts predicted just how quickly
buyers would gain the advantage in some areas, in part because
nationally real estate has remained relatively strong. But in places
like Silicon Valley, where home prices had until recently been growing
as much as 25% annually, things have changed. For more than two months,
for example Huck Hibberd has been unable to sell his Los Gatos, Calif.,
home for $998,000. Included in the offer: his sons' batting cage,
$30,000 of furniture and a 600-square-foot addition that he'll finish to
the buyer's wishes. "No one seems to know what his home is worth
anymore," says Mr. Hibberd.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Just how aggressive are buyers? Honore Frumentino, a Deerfield, Ill.,
agent, says that before Sept. 11, most homes there sold for within 5% of
the asking price. Now emboldened buyers are bidding as much as 25% below
that, and some sales are closing at a 10% discount, as anxious sellers
"cut their losses and get out," she says.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
By the time Robert and Dina Bomgardner made an offer on a one-bedroom
apartment on New York's Upper West Side in October, they were able to
lop more than 7% off the seller's $335,000 asking price. And when the
co-op board insisted that they put nearly $7,000 in escrow to cover a
year's maintenance, the couple simply said no -- and still got approved.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Some of the best deals are being offered by builders, who for the
first time in years are facing slowing sales. New-home sales across the
country fell 4.6% in October from the year before, and building permits
fell 3.6% that month from the month before. That has builders buying
down interest rates, subsidizing closing costs, and throwing in extras
to get their houses sold. Carr Homes of Annandale, Va., for instance, is
not only giving buyers $5,000 toward closing, but it is offering loans
three-quarters of a percentage point below the prevailing rate. (How can
they do that? Carr has built the cost into the $750,000 prices of its
custom homes.)
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Meanwhile, Shea Homes, Livermore, Calif., has cut prices 12.5% and is
also offering buyers in certain developments a choice of granite or
marble countertops and hardwood floors instead of the standard
carpeting. "For buyers, it's all about `What are you gonna give us?'"
says Joanne Anderson, vice president of sales and marketing.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
To be sure, anxious sellers have thrown in incentives before, from
grand pianos to pricey art and even cars. But those have usually been
offered by the owners of high-end homes using the extras as gimmicks to
prop up inflated prices. This time around, the goodies are available at
almost every level of the market -- and they often come on top of a
discounted sales price. And what's being offered is often cold hard
cash, in the shape of those discounted mortgages or givebacks on closing
costs. Paul Lazzaro, vice president of marketing for The Woodlands, a
Houston community, says it was selling just 12 homes a week after Sept.
11, down from 30 or more before. So at the end of October, the developer
and builders there started offering $1,000 gift certificates, $5,000
toward a golf-club membership, even $25,000 in upgrades. Last month, 80
houses sold, and the incentives will probably continue into next year.
"We think it will be necessary," he says.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Some sellers are deciding they'd rather wait for the market to
rebound, rather than give in to buyers. When he put his Bodega, Calif.,
house on the market for $740,000 in October, Marshall Logue agreed to
throw in his 500-channel satellite dish and projection TV, along with a
horse corral on three acres. But as sales in the region fell more than
20% in October, he realized he'd have to knock at least $100,000 off his
asking price -- and probably add in one of his horses in the bargain.
"Buyers say, `Give me this, this and this,'" says Mr. Logue. "I'm just
not willing to go that far." Now he's decided to stay put.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Indeed, agents around the country say more deals are falling apart as
buyers push harder, convinced that time is on their side. Connie Sadler
Gray, a real-estate agent on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, has had
seven deals fall apart in the past three months, as buyers have asked
for more concessions than sellers were willing to make. "They're waiting
for the economy to tank," she says. Agents are making deals, too. Ms.
Gregorio, the Union City, Calif., real-estate agent, says buyers have
lately been playing hardball with sellers, then turning around and
asking her to give up as much as half of her commission. And she's been
saying yes.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
As the buyer's market gains steam, builders who can afford to give
only modest incentives find themselves unable to compete. Only five
months ago, developer Ray Mills' three-bedroom homes in Aberdeen, Wash.,
usually sold within 30 days -- but since Sept. 11, he hasn't sold one,
even though he's lowered prices by as much as $15,000 and is offering
$5,000 toward a down payment. In fact, the only offer he's had was from
a couple who didn't think that was enough -- they wanted him to take
their old house in trade. Mr. Mills passed. "That's all I need," he
says, "another house to sell."
</p>

                     Stealing Home
  Builders in some markets around the country are facing falling prices
and slowing sales, so they're willing to bargain. Here are some things
they're offering buyers at their developments:
  Name/Location: Millstone Ridge, Millstone, N.J.; 732-780-1800
  Deal: Upgrades worth $20,000, from a sunroom to fancy fixtures
  Comment: Sales have slowed in the area since Sept. 11. Extras are
nice, but the builder, Calton Homes, recently raised prices by $30,000
on houses ranging up to $640,000
  Name/Location: Copper Creek, Oak Hill, Va.; www.carrhomes.com[http://www.carrhomes.com/]
  Deal: Discounted mortgages and $5,000 toward closing costs
  Comment: Prices are still going up in Northern Virginia, but houses
are taking longer to sell, including these four-bedroom, $750,000 ones.
  Name/Location: KB Homes, Las Vegas; www.kbhomes.com[http://www.kbhomes.com/]
  Deal: Free Whirlpool fridge, washer and dryer
  Comment: This is a limited-time offer. KB, a national builder, has
unsold houses in various Las Vegas developments.
  Name/Location: Stonecrest, Summerfield, Fla.; 561-274-2000
  Deal: Rebate of 3% of purchase price, to put toward finishes, carpets
  Comment: Houses are lingering on the market in Florida; these three-
and four-bedroom houses built by Oriole Homes range from $120,000 to
$200,000.
  Name/Location: Antelope Hill, Denver; 303-220-0232
  Deal: Cut-rate mortgages, starting at 3.99%

developer, has built the cost into the price of these three- to
five-bedroom houses, which range up to $362,000.
  Name/Location: Falbrooke, Livermore, Calif.; www.sheahomes.com[http://www.sheahomes.com/].
  Deal: Granite counters, Roman shades, even a Sub-Zero fridge
  Comment: Bay-area homes prices have declined for the first time in
six years. Builders of high-end houses, like Shea Homes, have been

Construction Starts Slid 1% in October
But Stayed Stronger Than the Economy

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Construction starts fell 1% in October, but industry continued to show
more strength than the overall economy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The value of new-construction contracts dipped to a
seasonally-adjusted annual rate of $490.1 billion, spurred by a steep
drop in the building of public works and utilities, according to the
latest report from F.W. Dodge, a building-research division of publisher
McGraw-Hill Cos. Nonresidential building, especially hotels, rose
substantially, the report said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"The construction industry has yet to see a sustained loss of
momentum," said Robert Murray, vice president of economic affairs for
F.W. Dodge. "It remains one of the better performers in this year's
faltering economy."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Dodge Index, a measure of national construction value that uses
1996 as a base year of 100, was at 148 for October, down from 149 in
September. The index began the year at 153, but weakened during the
spring and summer months, the report said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Residential building decreased 4% to $204.4 billion, with
single-family housing down 5%. The slowdown "will likely be followed by
further slippage in the next few months, given diminished consumer
confidence and falling employment levels," said Mr. Murray.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Nonbuilding construction, such as bridges and sewers, fell 12% to
$113.5 billion, even with the start of a $200 million Chicago
mass-transit program. The sector will probably continue to feel pinched
by "tighter fiscal conditions for the federal and state governments,"
said Mr. Murray.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Nonresidential building rose 11% to $172.1 billion, with the help of
a $75 million casino-related hotel in Henderson, Nev. Warehouse
construction rose 16%, and office starts grew 16%. Store construction in
October posted a 2% gain.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Murray said the nonresidential segment's performance is "a brief
departure from a more general downward trend," but notes that "the
correction now under way may become less severe in coming months."

Factory Activity Fell
Again in November
But at Slower Rate
</span>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
U.S. manufacturing activity fell in November at a slower pace than in
October.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In other promising signs for the economy, the government said that
consumer and construction spending each rose in October, while incomes
were flat.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In a report released yesterday, the National Association of
Purchasing Management said its manufacturing index stood at 44.5 last
month, compared with economists' expectations of 42.6. Index readings
above 50 indicate expansion of activity and prices in the manufacturing
sector, while readings below 50 denote contraction. The factory sector
continued working through a 16-month downturn.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"After absorbing last month's aftershock of the terrorist attacks,
the manufacturing sector showed surprising resilience in November," said
Norbert Ore, director of the survey, in a written statement. "The trend
is definitely in the right direction, but it is too soon to claim an
imminent recovery."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The November reading suggests a small amount of growth in the overall
economy, the report said; at 44.5, the index was above the 42.7
considered the threshold between expansion and contraction in the wider
economy and corresponds to a 0.7% annualized increase in gross domestic
product.The November reading follows the very weak 39.8 reported for
overall business activity in October.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
After a sharp drop the prior month, new orders rebounded sharply in
November. The November index stood at 48.8 after 38.3 in October and
50.3 in September. The gain in new orders was among the biggest
one-month gains in that category, the report said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Price pressures eased again last month, with the index standing at
31.6, compared with 32.5 in October. The reading implies that input
costs for manufacturers are of little concern, easing worries about
inflation. Meanwhile, manufacturing-sector employment remained weak. The
November employment index rose slightly to 35.7 from 35.1 during
October.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The NAPM data is closely watched by economists and Federal Reserve
policy makers. The Fed meets next week to deliberate on monetary policy,
and most analysts expect the central bank to cut rates to 1.75% from 2%
at that meeting.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"It's a little too soon to conclude the economy is out of recession
yet," Mr. Ore said. "But it was encouraging that we got such a bounce in
the production and new orders components. He called October "the bottom
for the overall economy."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
October consumer-spending data showed shoppers doing their part to
lift the economy. Personal spending rebounded by a record 2.9% as
purchases of cars and other big-ticket items soared. The Commerce
Department said the increase was the largest monthly jump since 1959,
when the data series began. The previous record had been a 2.6% rise in
September 1987.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Because spending rose more than incomes during the month, the savings
rate dropped to 0.2% from a revised 4.6% rate recorded in September.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The October consumer-spending rise exceeded analysts' expectations,
while incomes didn't edge up as expected. Economists generally expect
the U.S. economy to remain weak through the end of 2001, with
anticipation of a rebound early next year. The report probably won't
change expectations for a Fed rate cut.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Meanwhile in October, spending on new office buildings, roads,
public-works projects and homes rose, snapping a string of five
consecutive declines.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Total construction spending climbed 1.9% to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of $863.5 billion, the Commerce Department said. The report
shows the construction industry bounced back somewhat in October after
falling along with the rest of the economy, which shrank for the first
time in eight years during the July-to-September quarter.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Hard-hit business investment showed signs of life in October as new
orders for non-military capital equipment, led by technology, rose for
the first time since March, though the underlying trend remains weak.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
At the same time, a jump in jobless claims and drop in help-wanted
advertising suggested unemployment is headed higher, though a rise in
new home sales offered an encouraging sign that consumers are still
willing to make big-ticket purchases.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Orders for durable goods, or items meant to last three years or
longer, rose a record 12.8% in October, the Commerce Department said,
more than reversing a 9.2% plunge in September, which had initially been
reported as 8.5%. But most of the increase came in defense capital goods
orders, which tripled.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
That may include some of the $200 billion joint strike fighter
program awarded to Lockheed Martin Corp. on Oct. 26, but the government
said there was no way to know how much. If defense orders are excluded,
overall durable goods orders would have risen by 5.6%.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Capital goods orders outside defense rose 7.4%. That didn't offset
September's drop of 13%, and even at the latest level those orders stand
31% below their peak level of June 2000. But it did suggest business
investment isn't in freefall.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"The durables number seems to suggest that capital spending can't get
any lower," said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi. "I think we've reached the bottom there, not for the
fourth quarter, but in the first quarter of next year business spending
could pick up."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Separately, the U.S. Labor Department said first-time claims for
unemployment insurance jumped 54,000 last week to a seasonally-adjusted
488,000.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Many economists were expecting a rise of 13,000, but some experts
caution that the Labor Department had an unusually difficult time
correcting for the special seasonal effects of the Thanksgiving and
Veteran's Day holidays this year. "You have to wait a couple of weeks to
see these swings play out, but I expect a decline back toward 450,000
next week," said Jim Glassman, senior economist at J.P. Morgan.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
That level would still be consistent with declining overall
employment and a rising jobless rate.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In another sign of a weakening job market, the Conference Board said
its index of help-wanted advertising dropped six points in October to 46
-- its lowest level since 1982 -- from 52 in September.

New home sales held steady in October, adding weight to the view that

10% last week, back to their summer levels.

Orders for Big-Ticket Items Surged in October, Led by Aircraft Sector

Housing Market Remains Firm, but Jump in Unemployment Claims Signals

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON -- Orders for big-ticket items rebounded by a record amount
in October, more than reversing a large drop in the previous month amid
a surge in demand for aircraft and parts.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Meanwhile, sales of new, single-family homes unexpectedly rose last
month, suggesting that the resilient housing sector isn't yet feeling
the impact of the overall weak U.S. economy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
However, the number of workers filing first-time applications for
unemployment benefits surged last week after four consecutive weeks of
decline, suggesting that the shrinking economy continues to hurt the
labor market.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Orders for durable goods, or items meant to last three years or
longer, rose a record 12.8% to $184.76 billion in October, the Commerce
Department reported. September's durable-goods orders were revised to a
9.2% decline from the previously reported 8.5% drop.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The October surge was far greater than the 2% increase predicted by
economists in a survey by Thomson Global Markets.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Orders were mostly higher across the board. Transportation orders had
the largest dollar increase, rising $16.8 billion or 38.8% for the
month. The increase was led by a 233.2% jump in orders for aircraft and
parts, the biggest gain since June 2000. Excluding transportation,
durable-goods orders would have risen 3.4% for the month.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Defense capital-goods orders surged 206.3%, also the biggest increase
since June 2000. Some analysts had expected defense orders to partially
include the $200 billion joint strike fighter awarded to Lockheed Martin
Corp. on Oct. 26. However, the Commerce Department said there was no way
to know how much of that contract was reflected in the report. Excluding
defense, durable-goods orders would have risen 5.6%.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Orders for computers and electronic products rose 10.3% in October
after falling 8.6% the previous month. Orders for communications
equipment surged 58.2%, while orders for electrical equipment edged up
3.8%. Primary metals orders fell 2.6%, while fabricated metal products
orders rose 3.1%.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Durable-goods shipments rose 3.2% in October while unfilled orders
rose 0.9%. Durable-goods inventories fell 0.4% after being down 1.2% in
September.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Separately, sales of new homes edged up 0.2% to an annual rate of
880,000, the Commerce Department said. September sales were revised to a
1% gain to an annual 878,000 rate from the previous estimate of a 1.4%
drop to an annual rate of 864,000.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Economists surveyed by Thomson Global Markets anticipated that home
sales would drop to an 850,000 annual rate.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Despite weakness across most segments of the economy during the past
year, the housing sector has been remarkably stable. Mortgage rates have
been historically low for months and have been below 7% for the past
several weeks, helping boost home sales.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Other recent housing reports also have been better than expected as
well. The National Association of Realtors reported that sales of
existing homes rose by 5.5% in October.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The October new-home sales report showed that sales jumped 15.8% in
the Northeast, rose 3.3% in the West and edged up 1.4% in the South.
Sales in the Midwest, however, fell 11.7%.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The median price for a new home, the midpoint of all prices, was
$168,400 in October, an increase from the $165,300 median recorded in
September.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The average price for a new home was $204,200 in October, up from the
$200,200 average price in September.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
New-home sales were down 4.6% from last October's level.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Meanwhile, initial jobless claims rose by 54,000 to 488,000 in the
week that ended last Saturday, the Labor Department said. The increase
was the largest since Sept. 29. Economists had expected to see 435,000
claims in the week ending Nov. 24.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A Labor Department spokeswoman said jobless-claims numbers tend to
fluctuate greatly during the last three months of the year. The
four-week-moving average of claims, which smoothes out fluctuations,
declined by 2,000 to 454,000, the department said.

10% last week from the previous week, rising back to their summer
levels. With mortgage rates climbing, some buyers could be making their
move now, rather than risking higher rates later.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Some housing experts warn against putting too much stock in the
new-home sales data. In a research report released earlier this month,
Salomon Smith Barney housing analysts argued that the monthly new-home
sales data were "the least reliable statistic we track" for the housing
market because of flaws in the indicator's methodology that often lead
to large revisions. Indeed, the latest new-home sales report included a
significant revision for September's data; last month, the Commerce
Department said new-home sales fell 1.4% in September, but that was
revised in yesterday's report to show a 1.0% rise in September.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Some economists said they would rather see several more months of
positive data before declaring the housing market secure. Rising

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The housing market showed signs of rebounding after a dismal
September, but consumer confidence continues to weaken, suggesting that
housing and the broader economy might not be out of the woods yet.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In its monthly report on home sales, the National Association of
Realtors said sales of existing homes rose 5.5% in October to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.17 million units. That pace easily
beat the consensus of economists, who had predicted a rate of five
million units, and it represented a healthy recovery from September,
when sales dropped nearly 12% to a revised 4.9 million units.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But the strength of the housing market varied by region. Although all
regions saw gains, sales in the U.S. Northeast jumped 10.2% while sales
in the West rose just 1.6%.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Separately, however, the Conference Board reported that its index of
consumer confidence continued to slide in November, driven in large part
by rising unemployment and continued layoff announcements, to an
eight-year low of 82.2 from a downwardly revised 85.3 in October. In
November, 23% of consumers said jobs were hard to get, up from 20.6% in
October. The index contradicted the improving trend in a different
consumer sentiment gauge maintained by the University of Michigan. The
divergence appears due to the greater relative weight the Conference
Board, a New York research organization, places on job market
indicators, and the lesser weight it puts on financial indicators.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The decline in consumer confidence pushed stocks lower late Tuesday
afternoon, and raised new fears that consumer spending on everything
from holiday gifts to houses could weaken in the coming months. Earlier
this week, the National Bureau of Economic Research said the economy
slipped into a recession in March, making the recent 10-year expansion
the longest on record. Analysts worry that the depth and length of the
recession could be greater than expected if consumers, whose spending
makes up two-thirds of the nation's total tally of goods and services,
lose faith in the economy's strength and tighten purse strings.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"Rising unemployment and continuing layoff announcements" are damping
confidence Lynn Franco, director of the board's Consumer Research
Center, said in a written statement. "A turnaround in confidence levels
is not likely before year end, nor are retailers likely to enjoy a
blockbuster holiday season."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Even with October's rebound, questions remain about the strength of
the housing sector. Much of the gain came from sales that were already
in the works in September but delayed because of the fallout from Sept.
11 and a recent surge in mortgage refinancing that kept lenders from
processing loan applications quickly. Even with the October rebound,
sales are still weaker than they were late summer, when sales of
existing homes hit a record pace of 5.54 million units.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
There was also a potentially troubling sign in the October sales
report: The inventory of available homes fell 10.1% to a total of 1.95
million homes. That drop suggests fewer homeowners are putting their
houses up for sale, possibly because they view the market as weakening.
"If people are not listing their homes to sell, those are the same
people that would have bought a trade-up house" and now won't, says
David Lereah, the NAR's chief economist. The inventory decline "may be a
leading indicator that November's sales will soften compared to
October's numbers."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Overall, however, economists and analysts were mostly relieved that
the October housing numbers didn't repeat the sharp decline of
September. The data also undercut some other negative reports released
in recent weeks. Earlier this month, The Meyers Group, a consulting
firm, reported that sales of new homes fell 30% in California in the
third quarter compared to a year earlier, and dropped in other areas as
well.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But John Burns, a housing-market analyst at Meyers Group, said low
interest rates have brought many new-home buyers back into the
marketplace much like 0% financing offers have lured car buyers out of
the woodwork. Mortgage rates fell to their lowest level in 30 years
earlier this month, although they have risen in recent weeks. "All of
our (homebuilder) clients are saying that they've had a great last six
weeks," he says. The U.S. Department of Commerce will release on
Thursday a national report on new-home sales.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Prices declined in November compared with a month earlier, but
analysts cautioned against reading too much into the numbers. Prices
usually decline during winter months before shooting upwards again in
the spring, and prices are still well above their year-earlier levels.
The national median existing-home price was $145,300 in October, down
1.4% from September but up 4.8% from a year earlier. The median is the
midpoint: half the homes sell for more, while half sell for less. The
average home-sale price was $181,600, down 1.9% but up 2.7% from a year
earlier.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Other economic news was mostly negative. The Federal Reserve released
revised figures that show the industrial sector's decline has been
longer and steeper than originally reported. Output of factories, mines
and utilities peaked in June of last year, and has dropped 7% since.
Previously, the Fed had said the industrial production peaked last
September, and had dropped 6.4% since. The September peak and subsequent
drop was one of the factors that went into the decision by the National
Bureau of Economic Research to declare that a recession is now under
way, though it picked March as the recession's start date, mainly
because that's when employment peaked.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The revisions do show an increase in industrial production in July
instead of a decrease, wiping away the previously reported 13
consecutive month string of declines, the longest since the 1930s. But
they also show a bigger, 1.2% drop in October instead of the originally
reported 1.1% decline.

Existing-Home Sales Rebounded in October

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
NEW YORK -- U.S. consumer confidence fell unexpectedly in November,
driven in large part by rising unemployment and continued layoff
announcements, the Conference Board said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Separately, existing-home sales rose in October as home buying
bounced back after slipping in the aftermath of September's terrorist
attacks.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The consumer-confidence index fell to 82.2 in November from a revised
85.3 reading for October.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The present-situation index, a gauge of consumers' assessments of
current economic conditions, fell sharply to 93.5 in November, compared
with a revised 107.2 reading for October.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Consumer expectations, however, rose to 74.6 in November, compared
with a revised 70.7 reading for October.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The index is gauged toward its base-year reading of 100 in 1985.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"A turnaround in confidence levels is not likely before year end, nor
are retailers likely to enjoy a blockbuster holiday season," said Lynn
Franco, director of the group's Consumer Research Center.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Consumers grew more pessimistic in November than in October, with
21.4% of survey respondents characterizing current economic conditions
as "bad," compared with 20.7% in October. Those rating conditions as
"good" declined to 16.4% in November from 18.6% in October.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In November, 14.1% of consumers surveyed said they expect jobs to
become more plentiful over the next six months, compared with 13.9% in
October.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Separately, the National Association of Realtors said sales of
existing homes rose 5.5% to 5.2 million in October, from September's
revised 4.9 million sales. Previously, September resales had been
reported at 4.9 million.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"This report is not surprising. We were expecting some bounceback in
October," Chief Economist David Lereah said. Some home sales that would
have taken place in September were pushed into October, he said, adding
to the rebound.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The October report came in stronger than Wall Street expectations.
Analysts generally expected existing home sales to rise 2% to about five
million.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In its previous report in September, the association recorded a
housing market stunned by terrorist attacks. Housing activity came to a
near standstill in the week of Sept. 11 but has since recovered to about
95% of pre-attack levels, the association said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Earlier in the year, housing had been one of the more stalwart parts
of the U.S. economy as falling long-term interest rates supported home
sales.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the association's October report, the inventory of homes on the
market fell to 4.5 months from September's revised 5.3 months.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The median home price decreased to $145,300 in October, compared with
a revised $147,400 in September.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Existing-home sales among the regions were strong. In the Northeast,
sales were up 10% while in the Midwest sales rose 7.3%. Home resales in
the South gained 6.2% and the West region saw sales advance 1.6%.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In another report, Redbook Research said retail sales rose 2.4% in
the first three weeks of November compared with the same period in
October.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Redbook's report also shows seasonally adjusted sales in the
three-week period up 3% from the year-earlier period.

New-Home Construction Fell in October
As Permit Requests Came at Slow Pace
</span>
</div><div class="author">

</div><div>Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</div>
<div>613 words</div><div>20 November 2001</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>

</div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Evidence that the housing market is slowing mounted as new-home
construction fell in October and builders requested permits at the
slowest pace in four years. But many economists still believe the
housing market will avoid the depths of trouble apparent in other
economic sectors.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Commerce Department said housing starts fell 1.3% in October,
better than some economists expected, to a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 1.55 million units, after rising a revised 0.8% in September.
The decline was confined to the West, however, where builders broke
ground on 16.7% fewer homes than in September. Elsewhere, housing starts
were either flat or rose. Economists had been expecting a 4.7% decline
overall in October to an annual rate of 1.50 million units.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Meanwhile, requests for permits to build homes slid 3.6% to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.47 million units, a possible
indication that new-home construction will decline further soon.
October's drop came on the heels of a revised 2.7% decline in September.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The housing market has been sending out mixed signals ever since
Sept. 11. Although sales fell dramatically in the days following the
terrorist attacks, they have rebounded somewhat in some markets and are
now running at about 90%-95% of their pre-Sept. 11 pace, when sales were
at historically high levels. But some builders have pared back on
speculative construction, and economists worry that a continued rise in
unemployment could sap the life out of home sales, which have been held
aloft by low mortgage rates. Mortgage rates fell to the lowest level in
30 years earlier this month. They have risen significantly -- by as much
as half a percentage point at some lenders -- over the past week, but
remain close to historic lows. The rise was sparked by an uptick in
yields on 10-year Treasury notes, which serve as a benchmark for
mortgage rates.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Conrad DeQuadros, an economist at Bear Stearns in New York, said he
is concerned that the housing market is accumulating "quite a bit of
negative momentum." His own calculations suggest that housing starts
over the past three months have declined at a 23.6% annual pace. By the
same measure, building permits are down 22.7%, he said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Even declines of that magnitude for a short period would still leave
a healthy market, provided they don't get much worse. Freddie Mac, the
government-sponsored mortgage-finance company, said recently that it
expects home prices to grow 2% to 3% over the next year. While that
would be the weakest price appreciation since 1993 and 1994, it is
better than the price decline that some had feared.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Meanwhile, some other indicators are looking up. Late last week, the
National Association of Home Builders said its monthly index of builder
expectations rose two points this month, from 47 to 49, after falling
nine points in October. The index is based on surveys of builders, who
are asked about current traffic in model homes as well as their
expectations for future activity.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Barry Rutenberg, president of Barry Rutenberg Homes, Gainesville,
Fla., says sales in his area are as strong as they were in late summer,
as people who had made up their minds to buy in recent months are
rushing to take advantage of low mortgage rates. "The question that is
undecided is the next wave of people -- the people who hadn't yet
decided before Sept. 11 -- to see if they decide to enter the market,"
he says.

the U.S. economy deteriorates further. Although mortgage rates have
recently been at 30-year lows, unemployment continues to climb. Job
worries may keep consumers from shelling out the money necessary to buy
a new home, economists say.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Building permits, an indication of future building activity, fell
3.6% in October after dropped 2.7% in September.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Last month, single-family starts fell 1.2%, while multifamily starts,
or starts on apartment buildings, rose 1.9%. By region, starts rose 5.3%
in the Northeast and surged 14.3% in the Midwest. In the South, housing
starts were unchanged, and they dropped 16.7% in the West.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Housing activity, aided by low mortgage rates, has helped to support
the U.S. economy during its more than yearlong slump. The average rate
on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in October was 6.6%, down from 7.8% a
year earlier.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Rates on 30-year mortgages dropped to 6.45% several weeks ago, the
lowest level in 30 years of record keeping, according to mortgage agency
Freddie Mac. Rates edged up last week, however, to 6.51%.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Aftershocks of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks not only left consumers
and businesses shaken, but battered builders' optimism on sales. That
has improved, however. A November survey by the National Association of
Home Builders found that builders are more confident now about sales for
the next six months. But, they expect housing starts and home sales to
decline in the fourth quarter.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Evidence that the housing sector in the U.S. is slowing continues to
accumulate. New-home sales during the third quarter dropped sharply in
California and several major metropolitan areas in other states,
according to a new study.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The number of new homes sold in California fell 30% from a year
earlier, according to data compiled by Meyers Group, a real-estate
consulting firm in Irvine, California. The declines were 35% in
Washington, 19% in Philadelphia and 31% in Baltimore.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The data come at a time of uncertainty in the housing market, which
until the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 had been one of the few bright
spots in a weakening economy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Although home sales have rebounded somewhat since coming to a
near-standstill in the days following Sept. 11, it is still unclear how
strong the market is.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
New homes are also an important indicator because construction has a
broad effect on the economy in terms of employment and the purchase of
new materials, said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo &amp; Co.
in Minneapolis. "It generates a lot of ripple effect," he said. Sales of
pre-existing homes fell nearly 12% in September, according to the
National Association of Realtors. But sales of new homes fell only 1.4%
that month, the U.S. Commerce Department said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Although the Meyers data are just a small portion of the overall U.S.
market, while the Commerce report covers the entire country, recent
evidence suggests the Commerce Department may have understated the
problems in housing, and the numbers could be revised downward. A
Salomon Smith Barney research report released earlier this week warned
housing-market investors to expect "a fairly constant barrage of
negative housing statistics" in the coming months.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"The housing market has really been keeping the economy going for the
last 18 months, and that's clearly no longer going to be the case," said
John Burns, vice president at Meyers Group.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
New homes are also an important indicator because construction has a

economists had been expecting.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Although the Meyers data represent just a small portion of the
overall U.S. market, while the Commerce report covers the entire
country, recent evidence suggests the Commerce Department may have
understated the problems in housing, and the numbers could be revised
downward. For example, a Salomon Smith Barney research report released
earlier this week noted that several major publicly traded builders,
including Los Angeles-based KB Home Corp. and Lennar Corp. of Miami,
have reported significant drops in orders since the terrorist attacks.
The report warned housing-market investors to expect "a fairly constant
barrage of negative housing statistics" in the coming months.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The market would probably be even worse, analysts said, except that
interest rates are so low and are expected to fall to their lowest level
in 30 years when new data are released by mortgage buyer Freddie Mac
today.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Indeed, Mr. Burns, of Meyers Group, noted that low interest rates
have helped to sustain sales of lower-valued homes. In Las Vegas, for
instance, new-home sales rose 6% for the third quarter compared with
last year, he said, because of a large population of first-time home
buyers taking advantage of the rates. Still, that is a lower rate of
increase than the city has seen in the past, he said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In California, the rate of the downturn varied significantly in
different parts of the state. The sharpest drops were in high-cost
regions such as the San Francisco Bay area and Orange County. The
declines were less severe in Los Angeles County and in the Inland Empire
region made up of the counties of San Bernardino and Riverside. Meyers
said its data reflect contract agreements for new-home sales rather than
closing of transactions.

Bright Spot Dims
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Residential housing permits, which had been one of the few remaining
economic bright spots, declined in all but two regions in September
compared with a year earlier. The Mid-Atlantic was hit by the biggest
decline as the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, D.C.,
"undermined the psyche of home buyers and home builders" in an area
stretching from Maryland into New England, says Economy.com chief
economist Mark Zandi. The temporary closure of government permit-issuing
agencies aggravated the problem. Meanwhile, an already-souring economy,
notably in manufactured goods, contributed to the downturn in East South
Central states such as Mississippi. The more resilient energy and
agriculture sectors helped sustain the housing market in Rocky Mountain
and Great Plains states. But overall, home building is expected to
weaken further as widening layoffs -- worsened by terrorist-attack
ripple effects in states such as tourism-dependent Hawaii -- overwhelm
the benefit of lower mortgage rates.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
U.S. stocks dropped, erasing early gains after the release of an
economic report showing worse-than-expected performance in the
long-suffering manufacturing sector.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In midmorning trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 39
points at 9036, and the Nasdaq Composite Index had shed 1.80 points to
1688.40.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Other indexes also fell. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index moved
down 5.10 points to 1054.70, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index
lost 3.20 points to 543.20 and the Russell 2000 Index inched down 3.30
points to 424.80.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The economy remained the focus of stock investors.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Manufacturing activity declined for the 15th consecutive month in
October, pushed lower by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The National
Association of Purchasing Management said its index of business activity
plunged to 39.8 from 47 in September.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A number below 50 indicates contraction. Economists surveyed by
Thomson Global Markets had estimated a reading of 44.5.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"The manufacturing sector received a very significant setback driven
by the events of Sept. 11," said Norbert J. Ore, who oversees the
monthly report. "The decline in production and new orders are among the
largest in the history of our report, which began in 1931."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
However, Mr. Ore said that the "trend lines were moving in a positive
direction prior to this report. It is worth noting that the New Export
Orders Index indicated a much sharper decline in September than in
October, while the other indexes declined significantly in this
reporting period -- possibly signaling a greater sense of confidence in
global business during October."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In addition, the Commerce Department said U.S. expenditures on new
office buildings, roads, public-works projects and homes declined for a
fifth consecutive month in September. Total construction spending fell
0.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual $843.1 billion, the lowest level
since December. Economists had estimated a 0.7% decline in construction
spending.

Housing Starts Increased 1.7% in September

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Housing starts were stronger than expected in September, but other
forward-looking indicators continue to suggest the housing market is
weakening.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Commerce Department reported that housing starts rose 1.7% in
September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.57 million units.
Despite last month's rise, starts in September were running 3.4% lower
than the average rate of 1.63 million units for the first seven months
of the year.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Meanwhile, permits for new construction fell 3.0% to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 1.52 million, nearly a four-year low, suggesting
that activity will decline later this year. Also, the National
Association of Home Builders said earlier this week that its monthly
index of builder expectations fell eight points, the largest monthly
decrease since the index began in 1985.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Economists say that while home sales have rebounded somewhat from the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, demand for homes is still running below
pre-Sept. 11 levels, and some builders have said they intend to reduce
speculative construction. However, most expect low interest rates to
help prevent the market from completely falling apart.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"I would not look for a collapse of the housing market, but I would
look for a limited downward drift" the rest of the year, said Jade
Zelnik, the chief economist at Greenwich Capital Markets in Greenwich,
Conn.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The increase in housing starts last month was led by a 6.3% increase
in multifamily units, generally the more volatile segment of the
housing-construction industry. Starts for single-family units rose 0.6%.

Greenspan Sees Recovery Signs
---
U.S. Is Starting to Rebound From Terror Attacks, Fed Chief Says
---
Remarks to Congress Suggest Fed Is Inclined to Cut Rates Again This Year

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told lawmakers
the U.S. economy is beginning to recover from the shock of terrorist
attacks, but he warned that the recovery is uneven and that the
country's vaunted productivity growth could see a "one-time" dip.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"Economic activity recovered somewhat from the depressed levels that
immediately followed the attacks, though the recovery has been uneven,"
Mr. Greenspan said in prepared remarks to Congress's Joint Economic
Committee. He noted, however, that a full economic recovery will depend
on "the behavior of consumers and businesspeople," which remains
"difficult to predict."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
His remarks suggested the Fed is inclined to cut short-term interest
rates at least once more this year, possibly as early as next month. The
central bank has cut its target for federal funds, or the overnight
lending rate, nine times this year, bringing it down to a 39-year low of
2.5%. Investors widely expect the Fed to cut the rate to 2.25% when
policy makers next meet Nov. 6.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"Nobody has the capacity to fathom fully how the effects of the
tragedy of Sept. 11 will play out in our economy," Mr. Greenspan said.
"But in the weeks ahead, as the initial shock continues to wear off, we
should be able to better gauge how the ongoing dynamics of these events
are shaping the immediate economic outlook."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Greenspan said one predictable consequence of the attacks will be
new burdens imposed on the economy by the country's need for better
domestic security. In addition, he said, businesses are likely to devote
additional resources to make sure that supplies won't be disrupted again
because of unforeseen events such as the Sept. 11 attacks. Those
changes, he said, impose "important new collateral costs" that will slow
U.S. productivity growth.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"The level of productivity will presumably undergo a one-time
downward adjustment as our economy responds to higher levels of
perceived risk," Mr. Greenspan said. "But once the adjustment is
completed, productivity growth should resume at rates in excess of those
that prevailed in the quarter century preceding 1995." U.S. productivity
growth grew at an average rate of 1.5% in the 1970s and 1980s, and
accelerated to a 2.5% rate in the 1990s.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Still, Mr. Greenspan said, those burdens could be less onerous than
the economic burdens imposed by the Cold War. "We are, in effect,
currently using part of our increase in efficiency to supply increased
security, the Fed chairman said. "Of course, given the heightened risks
we face, these investments in security are, doubtless, quite sound. In
any event, such costs are likely to fall short of the costs we incurred
for security during the height of the Cold War."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Greenspan's remarks came amid a report showing that home-building
activity unexpectedly rose in September, suggesting the housing market
remains a bright spot in the otherwise struggling U.S. economy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
U.S. housing starts rose 1.7% for the month to a seasonally adjusted
1.574 million annual rate, the Commerce Department reported. That
follows a revised 6.7% drop in August to a 1.548 million annual rate.
August starts previously were estimated as falling 6.9% to a 1.527
million annual rate.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The September figures were stronger than expected. A Dow Jones
Newswires-CNBC poll of eight economists estimated a 2.8% drop in housing
starts to a 1.485 million annual rate.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The housing market has remained strong in the past year despite a
broader slowdown in the overall economy, helped by rising home values
and historically low mortgage rates, which have been below 7% for the
past several weeks.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Still, many economists expect the housing market to soften as the
rest of the economy weakens further. The terrorist attacks likely tipped
the overall economy into a recession. Even before Sept. 11, the economy
was weak, growing just 0.3% in the second quarter.

Hot Real-Estate Market
In New York Cools a Bit

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
NEW YORK -- Despite a torrent of demand for office space in the wake
of the World Trade Center attacks, New York may still be heading into a
softening real-estate market, say some local brokers and landlords.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
With the economy in a downturn, some real-estate executives are
concerned about how an increase in sublease space coming back on the
market and dwindling demand from new tenants will affect the city.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Meanwhile, softening market conditions are helping homebuyers in New
York to negotiate better prices. "I think there's a transfer of power
here," says Scott Durkin, chief operating officer of the Corcoran Group,
one of the city's largest brokerage firms that was recently bought by
NRT Inc. "Our prediction is we will have more buyers, but that they will
be looking at much more property, taking their time, and not feeling
like they basically have to bid on anything they see like they did a
year ago."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
He said the company had about 20% more listings in the third quarter
of this year compared with last year and that prices had eased between
3% and 5%.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
To date, companies displaced by the terrorist attacks have signed
leases in Manhattan for about 2.7 million square feet, according to
Bruce Mosler, president of U.S. operations at New York real-estate
services firm Cushman &amp; Wakefield. Deals representing another five
million square feet are pending, he said. Certainly, the grim twist of
fate brought on by the terrorist attacks has meant landlords have signed
many more deals in the past month than they would have otherwise.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But since Sept. 11, according to Bethesda, Maryland-based real-estate
information service CoStar Group Inc., more than 9.52 million square
feet of office space has been brought to the market. About half of that
is sublease space from tenants who no longer need space on which they
have outstanding leases.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Vivendi Universal, for example, put 250,000 square feet on the market
just over a week ago, according to Giles Wrench, director at CRESA
Partners, a real-estate broker in New York. "It was the intention prior
to Sept. 11 to dispose of that space," said Mr. Wrench, who is
representing Vivendi. "But obviously we have accelerated the marketing
program because of the current demand."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The terrorist attacks destroyed about 15 million square feet and
damaged about 15 million square feet more, though not all of the
displaced tenants will be seeking to replace all their previous space
downtown. "Many of those companies suffered such grievous losses that
it's unlikely that they're going to need as much space," said Mark S.
Weiss, executive managing director at Julien J. Studley Inc., a
real-estate brokerage firm in New York.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Moreover, said Mr. Weiss, many of the larger tenants in and around
the World Trade Center had extra space elsewhere in the New York region
where they have put displaced workers. Salomon Smith Barney, a unit of
Citigroup, Inc., for example, has been able to place about 2,200 general
counsel, human-resource department and asset-management employees from 7
World Trade Center in facilities in New Jersey and other offices in
Manhattan. The company has also taken extra space in Stamford,
Connecticut.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Given such factors, said Steve Swerdlow, president of the eastern
division of real estate brokerage firm CB Richard Ellis Services Inc.,
"even with the loss of the space (downtown) and commitments made (since
Sept. 11), the market's still soft. It could take us a while for this
market to tighten up again."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Adam Hochfelder, president and chief executive of property owner Max
Capital Management Corp., which owns eight million square feet of office
space in New York, believes the vacancy rate in New York, currently
somewhere between 5% and 7%, could rise as high as 10%. "I think short
term, there are definitely concerns," said Mr. Hochfelder. "But long
term, my theory has always been that Manhattan is still an island and
there is only so much capacity here."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Even with the sublease space and recession conditions, said Raymond
Torto, managing director of Torto Wheaton Research, a Boston real-estate
data arm of CB Richard Ellis Services, the New York market should remain
relatively tight. Mr. Torto predicts that vacancy rates will be down
around 3% by the end of the year.

Terrorist Attacks Have Varied Impact on U.S. Cities; In Europe, It's
Wait and See

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO, Ross Williams figured he could easily get
$650,000 (704,073 euros) for his renovated home in San Francisco. Now
he's so skittish about the market that he's auctioning it off this
weekend with a starting bid of $395,000 -- and thinks he'll be lucky to
get into the high $500,000 range.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"Am I worried?" asks Mr. Williams, a chiropractor. "Absolutely."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Before last week, real estate was one of the brightest spots in the
fading U.S. economy. Now, from Orlando to San Francisco, there are
already signs that the terrorist disasters in New York and Washington
have had a broad -- and remarkably varied -- impact on housing prices.
On the whole, the news isn't pretty: Analysts are downgrading their
earlier forecasts of around 6% overall appreciation in U.S. house prices
for the year. And in interviews, real-estate brokers as well as
potential buyers and sellers are largely pessimistic.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Economic forecasting firm Case Shiller Weiss, for example,
recalculated its projections for next year in the wake of the attacks,
lowering them for 18 out of 20 U.S. cities that it tracks. CSW, which
provides regular housing forecasts to The Wall Street Journal, now
expects prices to rise just 2.4% nationally, about three percentage
points below its earlier forecast.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But the changes aren't necessarily where you'd expect. Despite being
3,000 miles from the terrorist attacks, San Diego and San Francisco may
see sharp declines. And surprisingly, Washington, D.C., is one of the
few places where housing prices are actually expected to do better now.
Just last Friday, real-estate agent Shirley O'Neal listed a $160,000
condo there and sold it at full price the next day. Its location: less
than a mile from the then-smoldering Pentagon. "Washington usually does
well in a war," says Ms. O'Neal.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
While economists differ over how long the market may drag, the
short-term fallout has been pronounced in much of the U.S. In the six
days following the Sept. 11 attacks, the number of people looking for a
broker dropped by more than half, compared with the week earlier,
according to Web site HomeGain.com. Brokers this week also reported some
panic selling of homes near cities and an increase in people looking for
a place in the countryside. Open houses were sparse, with 40% fewer than
usual in Boston last weekend and the schedule remaining light in the
coming days.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The impact on some European residential markets was also noticeable.
"After the 11th, the market slowed completely for about a week because
people were diverted watching TV and reading newspapers. That caused a
lull," says Ian Perry, U.K. national spokesman for the London-based
Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. Though inquiries have resumed,
albeit fewer than before, he says "some people are waiting to see if
there is a major conflict, will there be an economic effect that affects
their personal circumstances." Even before the terrorist attacks, the
U.K. was braced for possible knock-on effects of a U.S. economic
slowdown. However, brokers say recent events haven't yet had a
noticeable impact on prices. And, at this point, forecasts are that any
slowdown in the recently booming U.K. property market would mean prices
merely holding steady rather than going into a decline.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"The residential sector at the moment is very much a case of wait and
see," says Paul Belson, head of residential research at Knight Frank
property advisors in London. As before the attacks, European consumers
are trying to gauge the outlook for the economy. However, European
residential markets remain fragmented, he notes: Whereas the U.K. is
similar to the U.S. in that most homeowners see their property as a
tradeable investment, in countries like Germany, people buy homes later,
with the intention of staying put for the long term -- meaning prices
are slower to react.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
London housing prices, though little affected so far, are seen
particulary susceptible to swings because they are very high and because
the city is closely linked to the wavering U.S. economy through the
stock markets and financial companies based in London. James Thomas,
head of residential development at Jones Lang LaSalle in London, notes
that year-end bonuses in the financial sector will be eyed closely --
any downturn could damp both home buying and building. However, he also
notes that a lackluster stock market could prompt consumers to put more
money into property. Others in the market theorize that nervousness over
a conflict could ultimately drive capital from the Middle East into
high-end London property investments.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the U.S., New York home prices are predictably expected to see
some of the sharpest declines. Prices had previously been projected to
grow an additional 7.3% this year. Now, they're likely to fall slightly.
The attack was enough to scare off a Cambridge, Massachusetts, couple
who were looking at a townhouse in New York's Gramercy Park when the
planes hit. "They got in their cars and drove away," says their
real-estate agent, Lanse Robb.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
To be sure, U.S. real estate had already shown pockets of weakness,
particularly at the higher end. The issue now, as in so many other areas
of the economy, is how long the downward pressure will last. Two key
factors: declining mortgage rates, which typically spur home sales; and
the jittery stock market, which has been falling sharply in the wake of
the attacks.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
David Lereah, chief economist at the National Association of
Realtors, believes appreciation will "drop a bit" from the group's
previous projection of 6%, but eventually will be propped up by a
combination of low interest rates and military spending. Another
question: Will the attacks affect the revival of big-city residential
areas, which were just beginning to see an influx of empty-nesters
looking to live near restaurants and theaters? "It sours the glamour of
living in a big glass box downtown," says Robert Shiller, a Yale
University economist and partner at Cambridge-based CSW.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Vacation-home brokers from Texas to Vermont are reporting a jump in
inquiries from urbanites that continued well into this week. Litchfield
County, Connecticut, broker Elyse Harney says she got several calls from
New Yorkers who had been on the fence about buying a second home and
have now decided to go forward, plus another call from a couple looking
to move out of the city even it if means a two-hour commute to work.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Even far from the crash sites in Camp Wood, Texas, real-estate agent
Barbara Chambers says she got several calls from nervous city-dwellers
in nearby San Antonio. And in San Francisco, the disaster is all it took
to prod residents like Naomi Williams, an Internet executive, out of the
city. Already put off by the area's high prices, and able to telecommute
from anywhere, she's decided to leave the hip Mission District and is
looking for a new, more remote place. "When there are so many compelling
reasons to leave anyway, it's just a no-brainer," she says.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Manhattanite Jan Grznar says he's not leaving the city, but may wait
awhile before buying the new apartment he hopes to find uptown. "Prices
are still beyond ridiculous," says Mr. Grznar, co-owner of a video
post-production facility. "I'm waiting till they come down to merely
ridiculous."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Still, even the most pessimistic observers don't expect the current
declines to be a knock-out punch. While some prospective buyers may
choose to refinance their mortgages and renovate in the short run, many
economists expect lower interest rates will eventually offset shaken
consumer confidence and layoff fears -- much as they did after the 1987
stock-market crash. "Even in a deep recession, most people won't see
home prices go down," says David Berson, chief economist at Fannie Mae,
the nation's largest source of mortgage funds. Others anticipate losses
in once-hot markets like Silicon Valley but expect overall appreciation
to return to the 4% to 5% range in the next two or three years.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In fact, cities with a big military base or with large
defense-industry employers may not see much of a dropoff at all, because
their economies ramp up in wartime. In Denver, Chris Haas is going ahead
and buying the $200,000 downtown loft he'd made an offer on before the
crisis. "It didn't cross my mind to be nervous," says Mr. Haas, a
software engineer, adding that with the presence of the famed NORAD
defense center and a number of telecommunications businesses, the local
economy should prosper.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Similarly, what theme-park heavy Orlando stands to lose in tourism is
likely to be made up by its robust military training centers. In fact,
some agents actually saw a pickup in business last weekend. "The only
deal that was postponed was a couple out on the West Coast who couldn't
get back for the closing," says broker Linda Mohring.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But others are preparing themselves for further declines. Mr.
Williams, the San Francisco chiropractor, says he was realistic enough
to try to auction his house, rather than retain a broker, to boost his
shot at selling quickly and maximize his profit. If the bidding doesn't
hit his reserve price, he's prepared to wait it out. "I'll just list
with an agent and go fishing," he says.

Housing Starts Slid
Sharply in August
After Small July Rise

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON -- Homebuilding activity fell sharply in August, suggesting
that the housing sector began to weaken after long being a bright spot
in a dimming economy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Housing starts fell 6.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.53
million in August, the Commerce Department reported. The drop followed a
revised 0.4% rise in July to a 1.64 million rate -- sharply down from
the initial estimate of a 2.8% gain.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The August drop in housing starts was mainly caused by a 22.7% plunge
in multifamily units, or apartment buildings. Starts of single-family
homes, which account for two-thirds of all starts, fell 2.4%.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Still, homebuilding remains at historically high levels, helped by
low mortgage rates that have hovered near 7%. Building permits, an
indication of future activity, fell 0.7% in August -- the third monthly
decline in a row -- to a seasonally adjusted 1.56 million annual rate.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Despite gloomy economic indications following last week's terrorist
attacks in New York and Washington, the Labor Department said that
workers filing first-time applications for unemployment benefits fell
sharply. Initial jobless claims fell by 49,000 to 387,000 last week; the
four-week moving average, which smooths out weekly fluctuations, dropped
by 3,250 to 409,000 last week.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Last week's terrorist attacks didn't show up in the latest data,
because filing for unemployment benefits isn't usually a top priority so
soon after a disaster, a Labor Department official said. Data for New
York, New Jersey and Connecticut didn't show evidence of an immediate
impact, but effects may be seen in next week's report, the official said.

Greenspan Looks Beyond the Attacks

Fed Chief Says Most of Damage Will Be Short Term

U.S. Central Bank Believes Economy's Long-Term Prospects Remain Bright

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned that the
U.S. economy will suffer "significant" short-term harm from last week's
terrorist attacks, with the possibility that investors will pull out of
financial markets and consumers will stop spending.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But in testimony to the Senate Banking Committee, Mr. Greenspan said
the country's long-term economic prospects haven't been dimmed much by
the attacks of Sept. 11, which destroyed the World Trade Center in New
York and part of the Pentagon. U.S. financial markets are returning to
normal, he said, and the attacks have generated more support for a new
round of global trade talks that could bolster the world economy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The attacks will "doubtless, have significant effects on the U.S.
economy over the short term," Mr. Greenspan said in prepared remarks.
"An enormous effort will be required on the part of many to cope with
the human and physical destruction. But as we struggle to make sense of
our profound loss and its immediate consequences, we must not lose sight
of our longer-run prospects, which have not been significantly
diminished by these terrible events."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill reiterated that optimism in his
testimony before the committee, saying the U.S. economy continues to be
"strong and resilient" after the attacks.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"The nation's financial markets, in spite of having sustained a
terrible blow, continue to function," Mr. O'Neill said in his prepared
remarks.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The comments came amid a report that U.S. home-building activity fell
sharply in August, suggesting the lackluster U.S. economy is finally
beginning to take its toll on the resilient housing sector.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The number of U.S. workers filing first-time applications for
unemployment benefits, meanwhile, fell sharply last week despite gloomy
economic indications on other fronts.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
U.S. housing starts fell 6.9% to a seasonally adjusted 1.527 million
annual rate in August, the Commerce Department reported. This follows a
revised 0.4% rise in July to a 1.641 million rate. July starts were
previously reported as rising by 2.8% to a 1.672 million annual rate.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The numbers were weaker than expected. Economists surveyed by Thomson
Global Markets projected housing starts would come in at a 1.63 million
rate in August. The last time housing starts fell by more than 6.9% was
in March 2000, when starts dropped by 9.3%. The 1.527 million rate is
the lowest since last October.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The drop in housing starts was mainly caused by a 22.7% drop in
starts for multifamily units, or apartment buildings. Starts on
single-family homes, which account for two-thirds of total starts, fell
2.4% in August, closer to expectations.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Initial jobless claims fell by 49,000 to 387,000 in the week that
ended Sept. 15, the Labor Department said. Economists in a Thomson
Global Markets poll expected a much smaller decline, to 425,000. The
four-week moving average, which smooths out weekly fluctuations, dropped
by 3,250 to 409,000 last week.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Labor Department also raised its preliminary estimate of claims
for that week by 5,000 to 436,000.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the wake of the attacks, some companies, such as British Airways
and American Airlines, have announced layoffs. However, the economic
slowdown since the attacks wasn't expected to have an impact on the
latest unemployment data because filing for unemployment insurance isn't
a top priority so soon after a disaster, a Labor Department official
said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Greenspan said the U.S. economy has proved "increasingly
resilient" in recent decades to economic disruptions caused by
hurricanes, earthquakes and other natural disasters. However, he noted,
"last week's events are of far greater concern because they strike at
the roots of our free society, one aspect of which is our market-driven
economy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"All modern economies require the confidence that free-market
institutions are firmly in place, and that commitments made today by
market participants will be honored not only tomorrow, but for years
into the future," Mr. Greenspan said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"The shock of Sept. 11, by markedly raising the degree of uncertainty
about the future, has the potential to result, for a time, in a
pronounced disengagement from future commitments. And that, in the short
term, would imply a lessened current level of activity."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Indeed, the Fed chairman observed, the economy nearly came to a halt
last week. The biggest economic effect of the attacks so far has been on
U.S. consumer markets, "where many potential purchasers stayed riveted
to their televisions and away from shopping malls," Mr. Greenspan said.
Motor-vehicle sales and sales at major chain stores have fallen
"noticeably," and the airline and travel industries also have suffered
serious harm.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In addition, tighter border controls and the closure of U.S. air
space last week have caused "dramatic curtailments of production at some
establishments with tight just-in-time supply-chain practices," he said.
For example, auto makers reportedly have cut production and closed some
plants because of supply shortages and, possibly, uncertainty over
short-term demand.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Greenspan didn't discuss the prospect of additional interest-rate
cuts by the Fed to spur economic growth. The Fed has cut its key
federal-funds rate eight times this year, lowering it by 3.5 percentage
points to a seven-year low of 3%. It has said it is inclined to cut the
rate again, and most analysts expect the next cut to come on Oct. 2,
when top Fed policy makers next meet.

U.S. Manufacturing Activity Slows
---
Contraction in August Was Less Severe Than Economists Expected

New Orders and Production Showed an Improvement

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
NEW YORK -- U.S. manufacturing activity continued to contract in
August, according to a closely watched survey, but the decline was much
less severe than expected. And many areas, including new orders and
overall production, showed a stunning improvement for the month.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Separately, spending on new office buildings, roads, public-works
projects and homes edged down for the second straight month in July.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The National Association of Purchasing Management said Tuesday that
its index of business activity rose to 47.9 in August from 43.6 in July,
the biggest improvement in five years. Economists surveyed by Thomson
Global Markets expected a reading of 44.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A reading below 50 denotes contraction in the manufacturing sector,
and August marked the 13th straight month of contraction.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Manufacturing employment remained weak but improved slightly, with
the employment index coming in at 40.8, up from July's 37.2. The prices
index dropped to 33.9 from 38.7 as manufacturers experienced lower
prices for the sixth consecutive month.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
However, "both production and new orders made marked improvement and
recorded impressive growth after a lengthy period of decline providing
encouragement that a number of industries are starting to recover," said
Norbert J. Ore, chairman of the NAPM's manufacturing business survey
committee.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The new orders index rose to 53.1, while the production index rose to
52.2 from 46.4. The backlog of orders index rose to 44.5 from 42.5, but
the number continues to indicate smaller backlogs.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Purchasing and supply managers remain concerned about overall
business conditions, the NAPM said. "In line with the improvement in new
orders and production," however, "a number of members indicated that
things are starting to improve in their markets," it added.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A purchasing management index in excess of 42.7 over a period of time
generally indicates an expansion of the overall economy, the NAPM said.
The August PMI indicates marginal growth in the overall economy while
the manufacturing sector continues to decline.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"The past relationship between the PMI and the overall economy
indicates that the average PMI for the months of January through August
(43.5) corresponds to 0.3% growth in real gross domestic product",' Mr.
Ore said. "However, if the PMI for August (47.9) turned out to be the
annual average for 2001, this would correspond to a 1.9% increase in
GDP."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Separately Tuesday, total construction spending fell 0.1% in July to
an annual figure of $859.4 billion from a revised $860 billion in June,
the U.S. Commerce Department reported. The June construction spending
drop was revised to a 1% fall from the 0.7% drop previously estimated,
while May construction spending was revised to unchanged from a 0.2%
drop.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Economists expected construction spending to rise by 0.1% in July.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Private construction fell 0.4% in July after falling by 1.6% the
previous month. Within that category, residential construction spending
decreased by 0.7% after falling by 0.9% in June.

Housing, Job Data Show Stability
As Consumer Prices Fall Sharply
</span>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON -- News about the economy was mixed, with higher housing
numbers and lower jobless claims, and a report that consumer prices may
be softening -- a positive for inflation hawks, but ominous for
companies' pricing power.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The consumer-price index fell a seasonally adjusted 0.3% in July, the
Labor Department said. The overall index was dragged down by energy
prices, which fell 5.6% from the previous month. Core prices, minus the
volatile food and energy sectors, remained relatively steady, rising
0.2%, indicating that inflationary pressures remain contained. Over the
past year, the price index has risen a tame 2.7%, identical to the
increase in core prices.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Four consecutive months of discounting in the apparel category could
be a sign of weak demand, while part of the increase in the core index
could be traced to a surge in tobacco prices.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Companies are likely feeling some pricing pressure as a result of
faltering demand, said Richard Rippe, chief economist at Prudential
Securities. "The weak economy is restraining pricing power," Mr. Rippe
said. "It's very hard for companies to pass along those cost increases
with higher prices."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
As inflation remains contained, the Federal Reserve could turn its
attention to other problems, Mr. Rippe said. "They are free to focus on
the weakness in demand and output," he said. The Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia yesterday provided another reminder of the dismal state of
manufacturing, as its index of the sector's strength in the bank's
district, covering most of Pennsylvania and parts of New Jersey, fell to
its lowest level since March.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The housing market, however, remained strong in July, as construction
activity rose to its highest level since February 2000. The Commerce
Department said housing starts grew 2.8%, with builders breaking ground
on homes at a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.67 million units.
Most economists had expected a modest decline.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Building permits, however, slipped for the second month in a row,
indicating that for all its strength, the housing market isn't likely to
pick up any more speed later this year.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"Housing is going to continue to do pretty well," said John Lonski,
the chief economist at Moody's Investors Service. But, judging by the
permits data, "it may be less than spectacular," he said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A separate report indicated that the job market looks more stable
than was previously expected. The Labor Department said the number of
U.S. workers filing first-time applications for unemployment benefits
declined a seasonally adjusted 8,000 to 380,000 last week. The previous
week's number was revised upward slightly, to 388,000 from 385,000.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The four-week moving average of claims, which smooths out weekly
fluctuations, fell by 9,250 to 370,750, the third week in a row that the
number has remained below 400,000, a threshold figure indicating a
deteriorating labor market.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Technology stocks continued to slide, weighed down by Ciena's
significantly weaker outlook. Blue-chip issues also fell after U.S.
government data suggested that the housing market could be starting to
slow.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In late-morning trading, the Nasdaq Composite Index was down 32
points to 1886.90 after sliding 45.64 on Wednesday. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average fell 45 points to 10301 after losing 66.22 in the
previous session.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Other major indexes were lower. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index
declined 9.30 to 1168.80, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index
gave up 4.60 to 601.40 and the Russell 2000 Index of
small-capitalization stocks slipped 4.40 to 474.60.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Bonds rose and the dollar strengthened.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The technology sector succumbed to more bad news about the health of
its corporate brethren -- a trend that has dragged the Nasdaq down for
eight of the past nine sessions to a four-month low.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Ciena beat estimates for its third quarter, but lowered guidance for
the fourth quarter and 2002, citing a projected decrease in sales of
long-haul products. Shares in the network-equipment company -- by far
the most actively traded on the Nasdaq -- skidded 28%.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Chief Financial Officer Joe Chinnici said the company expects
fourth-quarter revenue to be down 12% to 20% from the third quarter's
$458.1 million; earnings for that period are expected to be between two
cents and seven cents a share, compared with 17 cents a share in the
latest quarter. Analysts had predicted earnings of 18 cents a share in
the fourth quarter.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Ciena's effect on stocks was so great because while the rest of the
technology market suffered this year, the company has defied the trend,
keeping investors hopeful, said Arnold Berman, a technology strategist
at Wit SoundView
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"Ciena had not only gone through unscathed, but the growth rate
didn't even slow," Mr. Berman said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Corning, meanwhile, lost 4.3% of its value after its cable-systems
unit, which makes communications-network infrastructure, cut 450 jobs.
Brocade reported a 40% slide in fiscal third-quarter earnings, sending
its stock down 11%.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
While the latest U.S. economic indicators held some encouraging
tidbits, they weren't enough to support major indexes.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Labor Department reported that consumer prices fell 0.3% in July,
leaving the door open for the Federal Reserve to cut rates when it meets
next week. The department also said that the number of Americans filing
new claims for state unemployment insurance declined 8,000 to 380,000
last week.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Commerce Department reported that 1.67 million housing units were
started last month. But building permits, an indicator of future
building activity, fell by 1.8%. Thomson Global Markets forecast 1.63
million housing starts.

Market Shakes Off Ciena's Warning; Indicators Give Signs of Hope

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Stocks finished slightly higher after struggling with Ciena's earnings
gloom for most of Thursday.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 11.43 points to end at 1930.32, while
the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 46.57 points to close at
10392.52.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Other major indexes also climbed. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock
index rose 3.64 to 1181.66, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index
edged up 0.46 to 606.36, and the Russell 2000 Index of
small-capitalization stocks increased 2.71 to 481.66.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Peter Coolidge, senior equity trader at Brean Murray &amp; Co., called
the little spurt of buying late Thursday a "bottom-fishing rally."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"I wouldn't make too much out of this -- the bulls will take what
they can get," he said. "The market got washed out a little bit and is
just coming back since things got overdone on a short-term basis."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">

health of the sector -- a trend that dragged the Nasdaq composite down

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The news was significant because Ciena had seemed immune to the
broader technology meltdown, said Arnold Berman, technology strategist
at Wit SoundView. "In one of the most hellacious periods for telecom
spending, Ciena had not only gone through unscathed, but the growth rate
didn't even slow," Mr. Berman said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"Ciena is what I characterized as the best house in a bad
neighborhood. The question was whether the falling price of real estate
in the neighborhood would affect it -- and today, the house caught
fire."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Brocade chimed in with more earnings news, reporting a 40% slide in
fiscal third-quarter earnings and sending its stock down $2.38, or 7.8%,
to $27.96 on the Nasdaq.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Among Thursday's movers, Charles Schwab dropped 50 cents, or 3.7%, to
$12.87 after it launched informal talks exploring a purchase of
securities firm Jefferies Group. Some investment bankers say such a deal
could be valued at $1 billion or more.

Hopes for a Second-Half Rebound Fade

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON -- Prospects for an economic rebound in the second half of
the year dimmed further with reports that the contraction in
manufacturing reached its one-year anniversary, while construction
spending, a bulwark for the slowing economy, eroded in both May and
June.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The National Association of Purchasing Management reported that its
index of manufacturing activity fell to 43.6 last month, from 44.7 in
June. Economists had predicted a less-precipitous drop. Any reading
under 50 -- a mark not reached since July 2000 -- indicates a shrinking
manufacturing sector.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Meanwhile, the Commerce Department reported that construction
spending fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $861.6 billion in
June, a 0.7% drop, even as earlier results were revised sharply
downward. The May figure, first reported as a 0.3% increase, was revised
to a 0.2% drop.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Revisions to public-sector construction spending went all the way
back to January, to reflect technical errors in the state and local
benchmark calculations the statistics are pegged against. Private
construction figures were not affected.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"This is really sort of a troublesome report," said Dave Seiders,
chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders. "The
[second] quarter, as it's represented in these numbers, is really a lot
worse than it looked before." Mr. Seiders said the bad June construction
report would be a drag on revisions to second-quarter economic growth,
which the Commerce Department said last week was at a barely positive
0.7% annual rate.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Construction activity had helped support the struggling economy as
business investment dried up at the start of the year. But problems with
business investment appear to have affected commercial real estate.
Office construction has plunged more than 14.1% since March.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Overall, the longer-term trend remained strong, even though
construction spending saw its biggest drop since last July, according to
Gary Thayer, chief economist at A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons in St. Louis. "It
has held up very well and better than you would expect if we were headed
into a full recession," said Mr. Thayer.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The manufacturing report wasn't all gloom and doom. While the main
index fell, production shrank less slowly in July and inventories shrank
faster. Once manufacturers have burned off excess inventories, they can
boost production again.

Office construction has plunged more than 14.1% since March.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Overall, the longer-term trend remained strong even though
construction spending saw its biggest drop since last July, according to
Gary Thayer, chief economist at A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons in St. Louis.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
NEW YORK -- U.S. consumer prices rose in June, as falling energy costs
partially offset increases for food and other products. Separately,
housing starts rose sharply.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Consumer prices rose 0.2% in June after a 0.4% increase in May, the
Labor Department said. The core index, which excludes food and energy,
rose 0.3% after a 0.1% rise in May. The core-inflation rate was 2.7% in
the 12 months through June, up from a 2.5% annual rate in May.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Economists anticipated consumer prices would rise 0.1%, and predicted
a 0.2% advance in the core rate.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Shortly after the report, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
cautioned that the year-long economic slump hasn't ended and may require
an additional interest-rate reduction to spur economic growth.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Fed policy makers have cut interest rates aggressively this year to
fend off threats of recession, and haven't yet closed the door on the
possibility of further cuts in August.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Greenspan said Fed economists have lowered their economic growth
forecast for this year. The range of economic growth, as measured by the
gross domestic product, for 2001, is now forecast between 1.5% and 2%,
rather than 2% to 2.75%. The Fed has predicted the economy would rebound
to a stronger rate of growth in the range of 3% to 3.5% in 2002.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the consumer prices report, the Labor Department said increases in
airline fares and tobacco prices also contributed to the overall
increase.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Energy prices fell 0.9% after surging 3.1% in May. Natural-gas prices
fell 5.6% in June, the biggest decrease on record. However, electricity
prices jumped 3.8%, the biggest rise on record. Gasoline prices fell
2.6%.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Food prices rose 0.4% on the heels of a 0.3% rise in May. Tobacco
prices, which aren't seasonally adjusted, rose 0.5% in June.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Housing prices, which make up 40% of the index, grew 0.4% in June
after increasing 0.4% in May.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Transportation prices, which account for 18% of the index, fell 0.2%
in June after a 1.2% rise in May that was fueled by higher gasoline
prices. However, airline fare prices rose 5% in June.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In a separate report, the Labor Department said average weekly
earnings of U.S. workers, adjusted for inflation, rose 0.1% in June as a
0.3% increase in average hourly earnings was offset by a 0.2% rise in
consumer prices for urban wage earners and clerical workers. Average
weekly hours were unchanged.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said home-building activity in the
U.S. rose unexpectedly in June, registering the fastest pace in five
months.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Housing starts rose 3% to a seasonally adjusted 1.7 million annual
rate in June, following a revised 1% decline in May to 1.6 million, the
Commerce Department said. May's drop had been estimated as a 0.4%
decline to 1.6 million.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The figures are stronger than expected, and indicate the housing
sector continues to be an anchor in the U.S. economy. Economists
surveyed by Thomson Global Markets predicted housing starts would fall
by 1.6 million.

U.S. Consumer Spending Stays High
---
Personal Income Grows Less Than Expected, Manufacturing Remains Weak
</span>

</div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON -- U.S. consumers maintained strong spending levels in May,
helping prop up the nation's economic growth even as income growth
remained subdued.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
U.S. manufacturing activity contracted for an 11th straight month in
June but showed some signs of stabilizing. Total U.S. construction
spending grew in May, as business and government spent an all-time high
amount on homes, schools and hospitals.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Personal-consumption expenditures rose a surprisingly strong 0.5%,
the Commerce Department said. Personal income, which includes wages,
interest and government benefits, rose just 0.2%.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
April income growth was revised to a 0.2% gain from the previously
reported 0.3% rise, while personal spending was revised to 0.5%, up from
the reported 0.4% rise.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Growth in personal spending was slightly stronger than the 0.4%
expected by economists surveyed by Thomson Global Markets. Income,
however, had been expected to advance to a 0.3% growth rate.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The figures show that U.S. consumers continued to underpin the
nation's economic growth in the second quarter, offsetting in part the
slowdown in manufacturing output. Consumer spending accounts for
two-thirds of U.S. gross domestic product, and economists have warned
that a drop in spending could tip the economy into recession.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The economy grew a sluggish 1.2% in the first quarter, but many
economists expect a recovery to begin by the end of the year. The
consensus forecast of economists polled in The Wall Street Journal's
semiannual forecasting survey calls for real gross domestic product --
the inflation-adjusted value of the nation's total output -- to advance
2.7% by the fourth quarter and 3.1% in the first half of next year.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In May, spending on durable goods -- costly manufactured goods
expected to last at least three years, such as cars and washing machines
-- rose 1.2%, the strongest showing since February. In April, spending
on durable goods rose just 0.1%.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Spending on nondurable goods such as clothes and food rose 0.5% in
May, down from a 1% increase in April.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Spending on services grew 0.3% for the second month in a row. The
services category includes such things as gas and electric utilities,
visits to doctors, bus and train fares and rent.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
None of the spending figures is adjusted for inflation.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Because consumer spending grew faster than income in May, the
personal savings rate was a negative 1.3% during the month, compared
with a negative 1% in April. A negative savings rate suggests consumers
borrowed or liquidated assets to maintain spending levels. However, the
savings rate doesn't account for gains in retirement-plan assets or
wealth tied up in people's homes.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Separately, the National Association of Purchasing Management's
manufacturing index rose to 44.7 in June from 42.1 in May.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A reading of less than 50 signals that manufacturing activity is
contracting. While the June figures show the sector remains weak, the
increase indicates it may be gaining a foothold. Economists had expected
the index to largely hold steady.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The index has been below 50 since August.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON -- U.S. home-building activity picked up in April as the
housing market continued to maintain its strength in the face of a
broader economic slowdown.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
U.S. consumer prices also rose, although the higher prices were
mainly the result of rebounding energy costs. Those costs aren't
expected to keep the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates further
over the next few months.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In other economic news, online retail sales fell during the first
quarter of the year, first drop since the government began tracking such
sales in the fourth quarter of 1999.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Retail e-commerce sales fell by 19.3% to $6.99 billion during the
first three months of 2001, the Commerce Department said. The department
said total retail sales fell by 10.6% for the period. E-commerce retail
sales fell to 0.91% of total retail sales.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
E-commerce retail sales had been steadily increasing. In the fourth
quarter of 2000, e-commerce sales jumped 35.6% from the previous
quarter. Online sales in the quarter totaled 1.01% of total retail
sales.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
E-commerce retail sales during the first quarter were 33.5% higher
than the level recorded in the first quarter of 2000. The e-commerce
retail sales figures aren't seasonally adjusted.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Meanwhile, housing starts rose 1.5% to a seasonally adjusted 1.609
million annual rate in April, the Commerce Department reported. This
follows a revised 2.3% drop in March to a 1.586 million rate. March
starts were previously reported as falling by 1.3% to a 1.613 million
annual rate.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The new housing numbers were stronger than Wall Street's
expectations. A Dow Jones Newswires-CNBC survey of 12 economists
predicted April starts would edge down by 0.8% to a 1.600 million rate.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Low mortgage rates have helped keep the housing market at
historically high levels for the past several months, even as other
parts of the economy have deteriorated.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Indeed, the Fed, in announcing its most recent interest rate cut
Tuesday, noted that "consumption and housing expenditures have held up
reasonable well, though activity in these areas has flattened recently."
The central bank has cut interest rates by a total of 2.5 percentage
points since beginning of the year to bolster the economy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Still, April building permits, an indication of future building
activity, fell 2.5% to a seasonally adjusted 1.587 million annual rate.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
As for inflationary pressures, consumer prices rose a
smaller-than-expected 0.3% in April, accelerating from a 0.1% rate in
March, the Labor Department said. But the core index, which excludes
food and energy items, rose just 0.2%, unchanged from March. During the
12 months through April, core inflation was 2.6%, down from 2.7% in the
year through March.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Wall Street had expected a 0.5% increase in overall consumer prices,
according to a survey of 12 economists conducted by CNBC and Dow Jones
Newswires.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Labor Department attributed the faster growth in consumer prices
in April mainly to a surge in energy prices, which rose 1.8% after
falling 2.1% in March. Gasoline prices rose 5%, the biggest increase in
seven months. But natural-gas prices fell 1.6% and electricity prices
rose just 0.2%.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Food prices grew at the same rate as in March, up 0.2%.

U.S. Construction Spending Rises

Contraction in Manufacturing Continues Amid Concerns Over Energy Costs

NAPM Index May Boost Chances for Bigger Interest-Rate Cut

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
NEW YORK -- U.S. construction spending rose for the fifth-straight
month in March, as U.S. business and government spent more than expected
on nonresidential buildings such as schools, highways and office
buildings.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Total construction spending rose 1.3% to a seasonally adjusted $854.4
billion annual rate, the U.S. Commerce Department said. February
spending was revised to a 0.9% gain, compared with the previously
reported rise of 0.6%.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The increase in spending was well above the range of most analysts'
expectations, and may contribute to an upward revision to first-quarter
gross-domestic-product growth. The gains in spending were also
broad-based, with strong spending in private, nonresidential, and public
construction, the Commerce Department said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Private construction rose 1.3%, after a revised 1.3% gain the
previous month. Within that category, residential construction spending
increased by 0.3% in March, on top of a revised 2.5% jump in February.
Nonresidential construction spending, which includes offices, industrial
buildings and churches rose 3.4%.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Spending on public construction, including roads, hospitals and
schools, was up 1.4% in March, after falling 0.5% in February.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Total construction spending was up 3% over the same month a year
earlier.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Meanwhile, the U.S. manufacturing sector contracted for the
ninth-straight month in April, amid concerns about rising energy costs
and widespread sluggish demand.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The April National Association of Purchasing Managers' manufacturing
index was 43.2, up slightly from 43.1 in March but below expectations of
a 44 reading. Index readings below 50 indicate a contraction in
manufacturing activity.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"The manufacturing sector continued to contract in April . . . Major
concerns are energy costs and softening demand across many market
sectors," said Norbert J. Ore, chairman of the NAPM's manufacturing
business survey committee.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Even so, the April index suggested that the overall economy grew
modestly at a 0.2% annual rate, since at 43.2, the NAPM index was above
the 42.7 level, which is considered the threshold between broad economic
expansion and contraction.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Price pressures continued to abate in April, with the prices-paid
index, a gauge of material-cost pressures, moving to 48.9 from 49.9 the
previous month. In March, prices contracted for the first time in 22
months.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The national index comes amid some signs in recent months that the
declines that have weighed so heavily on the manufacturing sector are
moderating. On Monday, the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago
reported that its index of area-business activity rose to 38.9 in April
on a seasonally adjusted basis from 35 in March.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
All of the major NAPM components remained below the 50 threshold. The
employment index posted one of the bigger declines compared with the
previous month, and stood at 38.1 compared with 40.4 in March. That
decline made for the seventh-straight drop, and only one jobs sector,
chemicals, reported an increase.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The new-orders index rose to 45.9 from 42.3 in March. The April
production index rose to 42.9 from 42.8 the prior month.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
April's NAPM index may help add some pressure for the U.S. Federal
Reserve to go beyond the quarter-percentage-point interest-rate cut that
most are expecting from the central bank May 15. The data are adding to
evidence that the labor situation is weakening, and decreasing price
pressures overall are giving the Fed more leeway to move aggressively if
it chooses to.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"The good news is that there is no bad news," said Mr. Ore.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The increase in the index of new orders still left that component
below 50, indicating that orders are still declining but at a slower
rate. But, "the rate of decline was about the same in the last two
months; things aren't getting worse," he said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
He added that "the rise in new orders was very encouraging. They have
risen by eight points (to 45.9 from 37.8) since January."

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON -- U.S. industrial output rose an unexpected 0.4% in March,
raising some hopes that the long-suffering manufacturing sector has hit
bottom and may be ready to rebound.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But underlying numbers in the U.S. Federal Reserve report aren't so
clear-cut. March's increase, the first since September, was led by
autos, which had sunk to severely depressed levels, and by technology.
But technology's gain may not last long, given the grim forecasts from
the likes of Cisco Systems Inc.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Other reports showed a moderation in inflation and some softening in
the still-robust residential construction market.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The industrial sector began sliding early last fall, before the rest
of the economy. Manufacturers rapidly responded to weakening sales with
production cuts and layoffs, which weakened the broader economy. In
recent weeks, Federal Reserve officials have expressed hope that
companies' efforts to reduce excess inventories are coming to an end,
providing a base for economic growth to accelerate later this year.
Tuesday's report gives some support for those hopes.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"The increase in industrial production is a welcome first sign of
recovery," said National Association of Manufacturers President Jerry
Jasinowski. The association predicted a rapid turnaround for the economy
would begin in the third quarter, thanks to pared-down inventories and
expected lower interest rates and taxes.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But other factors, such as a sharp decline in factory payrolls in
March, could work against a recovery.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Within industrial production, the Fed said mining rose 0.8% in March
from February and utility output advanced 1.1%. Manufacturing rose 0.3%,
thanks largely to a 7% jump in auto production as Detroit restarted
assembly lines now that inventories of unsold cars have been sharply
reduced. Excluding autos, manufacturing output was down 0.1%.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
High tech output rose 0.9%. But its growth has slowed sharply to a
5.1% annual rate in the first three months of the year from 55% last
year, Morgan Stanley economists said. "Our industry analysts look for
outright declines in semiconductor industry revenues and little or no
growth in the telecom equipment and computer sectors this year," they
said, adding that indicates "some further slowing in production of
high-tech items going forward."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Fed also reported that U.S. factories, mines and utilities
operated at 79.4% of capacity in March. That's up a bit from 79.3% in
February and the first increase since August, but it's well below its
long-term average, suggesting manufacturers have little leeway to raise
prices.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Separately, the U.S. Labor Department said consumer prices rose 0.1%
in March from February, their slowest pace in seven months, thanks to a
2.1% drop in energy costs. Excluding the volatile food and energy
components, "core" consumer prices rose 0.2%, matching expectations
after two months of higher-than-expected inflation.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Still, core inflation is running at a 3.5% annual rate in the first
quarter, compared with 2.6% for all of 2000. Economists expect the
softening economy to contain further inflation pressures, leaving the
Fed to lower interest rates as much as necessary.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Also, the U.S. Commerce Department said housing starts fell 1.3% to a
1.613 million annual rate in March, on the heels of a revised 2.2% drop
in February to a 1.634 million rate. Single-family housing starts fell
4.3% to a still-strong 1,241,000 units. But UBS Warburg economists
cautioned: "Until the employment market improves, or mortgage rates fall
sharply further, housing remains at risk of slowing further."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
All numbers are adjusted for seasonal variation.

Manufacturing Index Rises for a Second Month

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON -- In another sign that the economy is stabilizing, the
National Association of Purchasing Management said its index of
manufacturing activity edged up in March for the second consecutive
month.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The purchasing managers' index rose to 43.1 from 41.9 in February,
rising just above the 42.7 level that indicates the overall economy, and
not just the manufacturing sector, is expanding. But March marked the
eighth month in a row that the index was below 50, the level at which
the manufacturing sector slips from expansion into contraction.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"The manufacturing sector is still declining, but we're now seeing
with February and March, the rate of decline slowing and the possibility
of a reversal," said Norbert Ore, chairman of the NAPM's manufacturing
business survey committee and a purchasing executive at Georgia-Pacific
Corp. He said an encouraging sign was that five of 20 industry groups
reported increases in new orders, and a surprise bright spot was that
the index of export orders exceeded 50 for the first time in six months.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Another positive sign was that the NAPM's prices index dropped below
50 for the first time in 23 months. That, said Mr. Ore, signaled that
the squeeze from higher energy prices isn't worsening.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
On the negative side, the employment index was 40.4, indicating
manufacturers continued to cut jobs, though at a slower pace than in
February.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The report was better than economists expected, especially after the
Purchasing Management Association of Chicago on Friday reported a steep
plunge in its index of business activity. The Chicago index covers a
smaller area and the data aren't used in calculating the national index.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Richard Berner, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley, called the
report "modestly positive" but noted that other information on the
economy showed a more pessimistic view. In particular, the improvement
in the index's export component conflicts with signs of weakness in both
Europe and Japan. "This is a world [economy] that is decelerating at
best and probably weakening significantly more than is commonly
believed. The fact in [Japan and Europe] we're not seeing a lot of
policy stimulus suggests that weakness is going to continue."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Ore said he believes some of the weakness in manufacturing
reflects structural problems. "This is just another form of the shakeout
we're going through and will continue to go through until we get a
leaner and more-efficient manufacturing base," he said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In another sign the economy is steadying, the Commerce Department
reported that total construction spending rose 0.6% in February to a
record seasonally adjusted $834.2 billion annual rate, up from January's
revised $829.4 billion. Private construction rose 1.2% in February.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Within that category, residential construction increased 2.4% in
February and nonresidential construction, which includes office
buildings, inched up 0.1%. Construction has been one of the economy's
bright spots for some time.

U.S. Manufacturing Softens Further

Construction Spending Rose for Fourth Straight Month in February

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
NEW YORK -- U.S. manufacturing contracted for an eighth straight month
in March, and price pressures decelerated sharply, according to the
National Association of Purchasing Management.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Even so, the group's monthly business survey came in firmer than
expected, suggesting that the worst might be over in U.S. manufacturing.
The latest data also could reduce the likelihood that the U.S. Federal
Reserve will cut interest rates before its next regularly scheduled
meeting.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Meanwhile, the U.S. housing sector remains strong. The Commerce
Department said construction spending rose for the fourth straight month
in February, as Americans continued to spend money on new homes, roads
and office buildings.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The purchasing managers' March manufacturing index was 43.1, compared
with forecasts for 42.3, and up from 41.9 in February. Index readings
below 50 indicate a contraction in manufacturing activity. The March
index also suggested that the overall U.S. economy grew after two
straight months of contraction. At 43.1, the index was above the 42.7
level that is considered the threshold between broad economic expansion
and contraction.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Price pressures continued to decelerate. The prices-paid index, a
gauge of material cost pressures, fell to 49.9 from 58.1. That is the
first time in 22 months that the price index has been below 50,
suggesting falling input prices.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Most of the purchasing managers' component indexes remained below 50,
but they firmed from the previous month, suggesting that the beleaguered
U.S. manufacturing sector, which comprises about one-sixth of gross
domestic product, probably bottomed out at the beginning of the year.
The 43.1 March reading corresponds to a 0.1% annualized increase in GDP.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The new-orders index, a leading indicator of activity, rose 1.5
points in March to 42.3, and production increased three points to 42.8.
Employment increased 3.2 points to 40.4.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Responding to a special question on inventories, 67% of respondents
described inventory levels as just about right, while just 19% said they
were too high. The results offered confirmation of many economists'
views that the bulk of the inventory adjustment occurred in the first
quarter, which should set the stage for faster growth over the rest of
the year.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
If that is the case, then the Fed might be less willing to take
dramatic action on interest rates to prop up the U.S. economy. The Fed
cut rates by 1.5 percentage points in the year's first three months, in
large part because of weakness in manufacturing.

Economists Now Expect

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
NEW YORK -- In the debate over whether the U.S. economic slump is
shaping up to look like a "V" or a "U," the U's are gaining an edge. And
that isn't good news.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A few months ago, some economists contended that the U.S. economic
slowdown reflected nothing more than an inventory correction confined to
manufacturing, where supply has been abruptly cut back to meet lower
demand. But now, more economists are thinking the weakness in
manufacturing soon could spread to other industries. As a result, what
was forecast to chart as a V-shaped recovery for the economy -- a sharp
downturn followed by an equally sharp upturn -- now is looking to
economists more U-like, marked by a period of flat or negative growth
and a more gradual recovery.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"The shape of the recovery is looking a whole lot different," says
Mark Vitner, economist at First Union Corp. In January, he had been
predicting a rebound to 2.5% growth in gross domestic product by the
second half of the year; he now sees third-quarter growth at about 1%.
GDP is the total value of the nation's output of goods and services.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Fueling this new wave of pessimism is growing concern about rising
high-technology inventories, expectations of a prolonged bear market for
stocks, weakening foreign economies and questions about the
effectiveness of U.S. monetary policy. Although the pessimists applauded
Tuesday's move by the Federal Reserve, which reduced short-term interest
rates for the third time this year, the pessimists believe the
half-percentage-point cut won't be enough to revitalize the ailing U.S.
economy in the near term.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Allen Sinai, chief economist at Primark Decision Economics in New
York who until recently was bullish about the economy, says he turned
bearish in part due to the persistent weakness in stock prices, which he
believes will cast a pall over consumer sentiment and result in sharply
reduced consumer spending and borrowing.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Personal incomes, which grew 2.84% monthly on average last year
compared with the prior year, rose just 1.89% in January, the latest
month for which figures are available. Employment and payroll growth
also have slowed, and jobless claims are rising, averaging about 375,000
weekly.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Economist William Dudley at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., who also has become
more bearish on the economy, worries about the effectiveness of monetary
policy. Although falling interest rates have helped to buoy the housing
market and have given auto sales a lift, stocks seem to be immune to the
Fed's easing. That is a concern, Mr. Dudley says, because it may
indicate that problems in the economy won't be quick or easy to repair.
Typically, when "the Fed eased monetary policy and was successful in
preventing recession, in each case the stock market went up after the
first easing. The fact that the stock market has gone down has to make
one nervous."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
To be sure, there are few signs of any broad pullback by consumers,
and some forecasters continue to believe the economy is on the verge of
bouncing back. Despite a small 0.2% decline in retail sales in February,
sales have been stronger than expected this year thanks to large gains
in January. Income growth, although slowing, has held up relatively
well, and housing starts have proved resilient.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Gail Fosler, chief economist at the Conference Board, has been among
those arguing that the economy's problems are mostly the result of an
inventory correction in manufacturing and don't extend into other
sectors. The Conference Board economist says most of the decline in
consumer confidence has been in expectations, not in the assessment of
the current situation. Sooner or later, unless large numbers of people
start to lose their jobs, or they see tangible evidence of a
deteriorating economy, consumer sentiment will rise, the Conference
Board maintains. Moreover, says James Glassman, senior U.S. economist at
J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., the economy shrugged off manufacturing downturns in
both 1995 and 1998.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Others aren't so sure. Ian Sheperdson, chief U.S. economist with High
Frequency Economics Ltd. in Valhalla, New York, says that only a
historic decoupling of spending from confidence would sustain consumer
outlays.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
And the inventory problem in manufacturing, while improving among Old
Economy companies, looks to be worsening among high-tech concerns. The
inventory-to-shipments ratio for communications equipment, for example,
jumped to 1.30 in January from 1.20 one year ago. "It's going to take a
considerable amount of time to work off the excess investment in
high-tech equipment," says First Union's Mr. Vitner.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Even equities analysts, who tend to be among the more optimistic, are
witnessing their anticipated V recovery turn into a U. In early January,
they were projecting 9% earnings growth for the Standard &amp; Poor's 500
companies for the third quarter, according to Thomson Financial/First
Call. Now, they expect only about a 3.3% increase on a pro forma basis,
which assumes the makeup of the index doesn't change. Analysts are
forecasting that earnings will have declined 6.7% in the first quarter
and 4.4% in the second.

Personal Income and Spending
Of Americans Increased in January

U.S. Manufacturing Improves, but Numbers Are Still Low

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON -- Americans' income and spending rose in January,
suggesting consumer spending remains strong enough to keep the U.S.
economy from recession.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Meanwhile, the manufacturing sector improved slightly, but remained
at a recession level. Construction spending advanced sharply in January,
paced by a jump in nonresidential spending.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
January's rise in personal spending outpaced growth in personal
income, the U.S. Commerce Department said. Personal spending rose 0.7%
in January; personal income, 0.6%.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The income and spending report was in line with Wall Street's
expectations. A Dow Jones Newswires/CNBC survey of 15 economists
forecast a January increase of 0.5% in income and 0.9% in spending.
Economists surveyed by Thomson Global Markets had expected a rise of
0.5% in income and 0.6% in spending.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
December personal consumption was raised slightly to 0.4% from 0.3%.
December's personal-income gain of 0.4% was unrevised. The January gain
in spending over incomes pushed the personal-savings rate -- savings as
a percentage of after-tax income -- to an all-time low of negative 1%.
That followed a negative 0.8% in December. The negative savings rate
suggests consumers borrowed or sold assets to maintain spending levels.
The last time the savings rate was positive was in June, when it stood
at 0.3%.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But analysts say the savings rate doesn't provide a complete picture
of household finances, because it doesn't capture gains realized from
such things as higher real-estate values or from financial investments.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The January rise in personal spending was helped by a 1.9% gain for
big-ticket durable goods, such as cars. Spending on nondurable goods
rose 0.6% in January, and spending on services increased 0.5%. Spending
on services, which includes utility bills, was up 0.8% the past two
months, reflecting in part higher energy costs.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The gain in consumer spending was in line with Wednesday's assessment
by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan that the "steep fall
off" in consumer confidence hasn't dramatically affected spending
habits. Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of economic growth.
The 2.8% gain in personal spending in the fourth quarter of 2000 kept
the U.S. economy from negative growth as the overall economy grew 1.1%.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In congressional testimony Wednesday, Mr. Greenspan said "changes in
consumer confidence will require close scrutiny in the months ahead" and
suggested the Fed stood ready to again cut rates after two cuts in
January. Most analysts expect the Fed to cut rates at its regularly
scheduled meeting on March 20, if not before.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Meanwhile, the gain in personal income was affected by several
factors, including pay raises for federal workers and military personnel
and cost-of-living adjustments for programs such as Social Security, a
federal entitlement program for the elderly and the disabled. Excluding
such special factors, personal income would have risen 0.3%, the
Commerce Department said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Separately, initial claims for unemployment benefits rose 39,000 in
the week ended Feb. 24 to 372,000, the Labor Department reported. The
Labor Department said unemployment claims decreased 11,000 to 333,000 in
the week of Feb. 17. This is a sharp revision from the preliminary
estimate of 348,000. The Labor Department said one large state misjudged
its estimate enough to throw off the national total.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The four-week moving average, which smooths out statistical
fluctuations, continued to increase in the week of Feb. 24. The average
rose 5,500 to 352,500, the highest level since Jan. 6. Meanwhile, the
U.S. manufacturing sector contracted for the seventh straight month, but
appeared to stem some of the steeper declines seen recently, the
National Association of Purchasing Management said.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Meanwhile, the manufacturing sector improved slightly, but remained
at a recession level. Construction spending advanced sharply in January,
paced by a jump in nonresidential spending.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
January's rise in personal spending outpaced growth in personal
income, the U.S. Commerce Department said. Personal spending rose 0.7%
in January; personal income, 0.6%.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The income and spending report was in line with Wall Street's
expectations. A Dow Jones Newswires/CNBC survey of 15 economists
forecast a January increase of 0.5% in income and 0.9% in spending.
Economists surveyed by Thomson Global Markets had expected a rise of
0.5% in income and 0.6% in spending.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
December personal consumption was raised slightly to 0.4% from 0.3%.
December's personal income gain of 0.4% was unrevised.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The January gain in spending over incomes pushed the personal savings
rate -- savings as a percentage of after-tax income -- to an all-time
low of negative 1%. That followed a negative 0.8% in December. The
negative savings rate suggests consumers borrowed or sold assets to
maintain spending levels. The last time the savings rate was positive
was in June, when it stood at 0.3%.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But analysts say the savings rate doesn't provide a complete picture
of household finances, because it doesn't capture gains realized from
such things as higher real-estate values or from financial investments.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The January rise in personal spending was helped by a 1.9% gain for
big-ticket durable goods, such as cars. Spending on nondurable goods
rose 0.6% in January, and spending on services increased 0.5%. Spending
on services, which includes utility bills, was up 0.8% the past two
months, reflecting in part higher energy costs.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The gain in consumer spending was in line with Wednesday's assessment
by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan that the "steep fall
off" in consumer confidence hasn't dramatically affected spending
habits. Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of economic growth.
The 2.8% gain in personal spending in the fourth quarter of 2000 kept
the U.S. economy from negative growth as the overall economy grew 1.1%.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In congressional testimony Wednesday, Mr. Greenspan said "changes in
consumer confidence will require close scrutiny in the months ahead" and
suggested the Fed stood ready to again cut rates after two cuts in
January. Most analysts expect the Fed to cut rates at its regularly
scheduled meeting on March 20, if not before.

Cold Weather Chills Home Building in Many States
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Cold weather hammered residential construction in most states during
the fourth quarter, as building permits dropped from year-earlier
levels. Notable exceptions were California and New York, where home
builders are still catching up from a decade of underbuilding caused
partly by earlier financial woes. And in Colorado, permits increased 14%
as builders played catch-up to the state's population surge of the
1990s. Permits in Texas inched up, thanks largely to higher oil prices
fueling a housing rebound in Houston. But elsewhere, frigid temperatures
stalled housing projects, particularly compared with the last three
months of 1999, when mild weather was ideal for home builders. Lower
interest rates may help boost home sales a bit this year, but
Economy.com chief economist Mark Zandi says a flat stock market, slower
job growth and other downbeat economic news will prevent home building
from matching strong levels of the past two years.

WASHINGTON -- First-time applications for unemployment benefits in the
U.S. plunged 10.8% in the latest week, according to U.S. government
figures, reaching their lowest level in more than three months.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Separately, home-building increased unexpectedly in December despite
a slowing economy and record cold weather. U.S. housing starts rose 0.3%

Department reported Thursday. Housing starts, however, are down 11% from
a year earlier.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The housing and unemployment data, combined with other recent
economic statistics, suggest the U.S. economy isn't drastically slowing.

Total jobless claims numbered 306,000, down 37,000 from a revised
343,000 in the week earlier, and the lowest since 301,000 in the the
week of Sept. 30, the U.S. Labor Department said.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The number of new claims was well below private economists' forecast
of 360,000. Claims originally had been reported at 345,000 for the week

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The department attributed the drop to seasonal factors.

The December housing starts performance was much stronger than
expected.

LOS ANGELES -- Home builder Kaufman &amp; Broad Home Corp. surpassed

The reason is the more modest-price housing [is generally purchased by]
a less discretionary buyer, who is not affected by the so-called wealth
effect of stockholdings . . . if people purchase and they maintain their
job, they close."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
For the quarter ended Nov. 30, Kaufman &amp; Broad said net income rose
14% to $73.4 million, or $2 a diluted share, compared with net income of
$64.5 million, or $1.36 a share, for the year-earlier  period. Analysts
had predicted earnings of $1.81 a share. Revenue rose to $1.24 billion
from $1.22 billion. Kaufman &amp; Broad said the increased profit was due to
improvements in housing gross-profit margins, a decrease in selling,
general and administrative costs, as well as a 22.3% reduction in the
number of shares outstanding as the result of a share-repurchase
program.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
For the full year, Kaufman &amp; Broad reported net income of $210
million, or $5.24 a diluted share, compared with net of $159.2 million,
or $3.33 a share, for 1999. Revenue rose to $3.93 billion from $3.84
billion. Analysts had been estimating $5.05 a share.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In recent years, the company has been steering away from the
difficult California market, which in 1996 accounted for nearly 50% of
all its sales and last year accounted for just 24%. The California
new-housing market is a tough one due to high land prices and fees as
well as a difficult entitlement process that requires greater amounts of
cash to develop homes than in other markets. Orders have been rising in
the Central market region, which includes Colorado and Texas, as well as
in France, an international market where the company operates.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Kaufman &amp; Broad also announced that, effective Wednesday, it will
change its name to KB Home Corp. to reflect how most customers have been
referring to the company. Mr. Karatz described the new name as "warmer"
and said its shorter length "will maximize the visibility of our name in
every message," which is important because the company derives nearly
half of customer traffic into its sales offices from signs.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON -- U.S. construction spending fell by 0.6% in November, the
weakest performance in four months, reflecting a sharp drop in spending
on big government projects and home improvements.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The report, released by the U.S. Commerce Department, offered the
latest sign of a weakening economy. Stock-market volatility, lower
consumer confidence and higher energy prices have been damping
consumers' and businesses' desire to spend.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The value of construction projects nationwide declined to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $815.6 billion (859.1 billion) in
November, a 0.6% drop from October.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
It marked the first decline in construction spending since a drop of
0.7% in July. Many analysts expected construction spending to be flat.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In October, construction spending rose by 0.8%, according to revised
figures. That was slightly weaker than the government previously
reported.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In November, the weakness in construction spending was led by a 2.1%
drop in big government projects. The government spent less on building
houses and highways in November, but more on military projects.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The report also showed that spending on private construction fell by
0.1% in November with all the weakness concentrated in the residential
sector, with a 1.5% decline. That reflected a sharp, 6.3% decrease in
spending on home improvements.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Spending on new single-family homes rose slightly, by 0.3%, in
November, helped out by cheaper mortgage rates. Spending on apartments
also rose.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
After hitting a five-year high in May, rates on 30-year fixed-rate
mortgages have been falling. They hit a 19-month low of 7.1% last week.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Spending by private businesses on nonresidential projects, such as
office buildings and motels, rose by 1.2%.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON -- Housing construction rose a bit faster than analysts
expected in November, but big gains in apartment building masked
weakness in the market for single-family homes.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Commerce Department said yesterday that housing starts rose 2.2%
in November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.56 million units,
a significant improvement over the 0.1% increase in October. But ground
breaking on single-family homes -- the largest segment -- fell 0.4%.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Construction of apartment buildings and other multi-family dwellings
jumped 13.7% after falling 3% in October. Construction starts on
multi-family dwellings are prone to sharp swings. But the increase could
also signal that consumers are no longer feeling rich or confident
enough to buy houses.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"Sales have been steady, but overall, the traffic has fallen off and
I do believe it is leading us to a general slowdown in the marketplace,"
said John Dewey, owner of Dewey Homes LP, which builds single-family
homes in the Philadelphia area. "Throughout much of the second half of
1999 and the first half of 2000, there was a general euphoria in the
marketplace as people took money out of the (stock) market and put it
into real estate."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
With consumer confidence edging down and equity markets ending a less
than stellar year, it's no surprise that some of the froth would come
off the once-booming housing market.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"This is the first time this year that we've seen a shift away from
everybody fretting about the shortage of labor and building lots," said
Dave Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of Home
Builders, which released its monthly survey of builders on Tuesday. "Now
the focus has shifted to the condition of demand for homes."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The NAHB's housing-market index fell eight points to 57 in December.
That's 27% off its peak at the end of 1998.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The November gains in housing starts were unevenly distributed across
the nation, with declines in the Northeast, Midwest and South more than
offset by a 28% increase in the West.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Even with the rates on 30-year mortgages down more than a full
percentage point from their peak in May, housing construction is looking
a little soft.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"The housing numbers could end up, in coming months, pivotal in
telling the Fed just how much they need to ease next year," said Maury
Harris, chief U.S. economist at UBS Warburg in New York.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
By region, the West showed the biggest move in the month, posting a
28.1% rise. The other three regions saw declines in starts. The
Northeast saw the biggest decline at 10.9%, while the South saw a 5.2%
drop and starts in the Midwest fell 1.9%.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
October housing starts were revised downward a bit. Commerce
estimated a 0.6% decrease in October at a 1.528 million rate, compared
with the 0.1% increase and 1.532 million rate previously reported.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The region's economy is slowing on all cylinders.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Southeast Index of Leading Indicators fell in September, drifting
back to its lackluster early-summer level. All six components of the
index worsened from August, ranging from slight declines in construction
employment and manufacturers' average weekly hours to bigger falloffs in
residential building permits and sales-tax collection.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In Georgia, construction employment, which is a traditional strong
point, barely budged in September compared with September 1999,
according to the Georgia State University index. And a new forecast from
the University of Georgia predicts a 1.2% decline in construction
employment in that state in 2001 compared with this year, primarily
because residential building permits are expected to decline 8.7%. One
bright spot, says University of Georgia economist Jeffrey Humphreys:
Homeowners are expected to spend more on home improvements.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the Carolinas, after a vigorous spring, commercial construction
could deteriorate as the year ends because of higher interest rates and
slower economic growth, says Tony Plath, a professor at the University
of North Carolina at Charlotte who surveys contractors in the two
states.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Of course, the region is still growing, and at a rate faster than the
national economy. The University of Georgia forecast predicts a 4.9%
increase in that state's gross state product -- the value of all goods
and services -- in 2001 compared with this year. That's slower than a
peak of 6.8% in 1998 and 6.1% expected for 2000, but still better than
the 3.7% predicted for the nation in 2001. But Mr. Humphreys doesn't see
much relief from the state's tight labor markets: He expects
unemployment in Georgia to remain at 3.8% in 2001.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
NAPLES -- Flocks of roseate spoonbills and egrets feed in the shallows
and dolphins frolic in the serene mangrove-lined inlets of Rookery Bay
estuary.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Will such scenes set the mood for closing million-dollar home sales?
Developer Aubrey Ferrao is banking on it. This week Mr. Ferrao's Gulf
Bay Group of Cos. began offering boat tours of the bucolic Rookery Bay
and the adjacent Ten Thousand Islands preserve for prospective buyers at
his 3,700-acre Fiddler's Creek housing development, about 10 miles
southwest of Naples.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"It's a very peaceful feeling; it calms the soul -- and that was very
important to us from a marketing standpoint," says Mr. Ferrao, president
and chief executive of Naples-based Gulf Bay.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The environmental pitch is quite a turn of events for the land where
Fiddler's Creek is being built. Twenty-five years ago, Deltona Corp.,
one of the state's largest developers at the time, planned a massive
development on the order of Miami Beach here, until lawsuits from
environmentalists, the state and federal governments killed most of the
project and crippled the company. The fight prompted a new era of
environmental standards restricting how developers can build near
wetlands throughout Florida.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
These days the nature sanctuary established where Deltona planned to
tread is the star attraction. Mr. Ferrao placed his sales office on a
site overlooking a marsh, rather than the golf-course setting preferred
by many area developers. Homes come with an optional $17,500 canoe dock
(canoes extra). And the boat tours -- complete with hors d'oeuvres and
spring water -- drive home the point that Fiddler's Creek is less than
five miles from the vast wilderness of the southwestern tip of Florida.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But the most remarkable difference is the relative absence of
fighting between the developer and environmentalists. Mr. Ferrao has
disarmed much of the opposition by working with one of Deltona's
harshest critics: the Conservancy of Southwest Florida. At the state's
and the group's urging, he has promised to restore the property's water
flow that feeds into state-owned conservation land next door, use native
plant species to landscape and sharply curtail the number of homes,
thereby providing space for bird habitats.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
While Mr. Ferrao says the changes appeal to his own conservationist
beliefs, he also acknowledges they help him sell pricier homes. For
example, a creek system he is developing to restore water flow will
create another 5.5 miles of waterfront property.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
To be sure, not all environmental groups are fans of Fiddler's Creek.
Some argue Mr. Ferrao's marketing pitch is hypocritical because his
development still contributes to water pollution with home sites and
golf courses -- Fiddler's Creek will have five -- that cause runoff into
pristine estuaries. "It does prove our point that nature sells," says
Nancy Payton, Southwest Florida field representative for the Florida
Wildlife Federation. "The point is how much do you degrade it and
manipulate it to sell it."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Ferrao isn't alone in using nature-conscious development as a
sales strategy, both to stand out from the competition and to overcome
concerns about destruction of wildlife habitat. On Kiawah Island, S.C.,
for example, other developers are winning at least begrudging support
from onetime environmentalist foes.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"I hated to see Kiawah developed, but I am grateful that they have
been some somewhat conscious" of the environment, says Ann Shahid,
education director at the Francis Beidler Forest near Charleston, who
was among local activists that fought the development in the 1980s.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The relative calm surrounding development of Fiddler's Creek is a
striking contrast to the protracted fight triggered by Miami-based
Deltona's plan to build 35,000 homes on new dredged-out canals on Marco
Island. Environmental groups assailed the plan, warning it would cause
irreparable harm to mangroves and wildlife habitats of the Ten Thousand
Islands.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In 1976 the Army Corps of Engineers denied the company crucial
dredge-and-fill permits, marking the first time the Corps had denied
development on wetlands on environmental grounds in Florida. That led to
stricter development standards statewide, such as requiring developers
to restore or replace wetlands disturbed by development. In 1982 Deltona
agreed to a settlement that allowed the company to proceed with a
scaled-back plan to build condominiums on less environmentally sensitive
property. But it was also required to hand over 15,000 acres to be
included in the Rookery Bay sanctuary and refund millions of dollars in
deposits from would-be buyers. It never fully recovered from the
financial blow. It came close to bankruptcy in the early 1990s,
according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and
was finally absorbed by foreign investors in 1993.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Adversity to Advantage
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
At about the same time as Deltona's demise, Mr. Ferrao, a 46-year-old
native of Goa, India, was learning that proximity to nature preserves
could be turned to his advantage. His first project -- a series of
condominium towers in the Pelican Bay area near Naples -- was built not
directly on the beach, but behind a buffer of mangroves that was
required as part of another developer's earlier fight with
environmentalists.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
After his condos sold well, Mr. Ferrao wanted to try the
nature-marketing concept on a 1,350-acre tract he bought for $4.6
million in 1993 from several New York banks, part of the original
Deltona holdings. He added to the property in 1995 by purchasing an
adjacent 2,700 acres of farmland and other smaller holdings nearby, for
$12 million.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The purchase immediately raised concerns among environmentalists
because it signaled a major development spilling over the so-called
urban service boundary of Naples, a line established as part of the
state's Growth Management Act that restricts development to prevent
urban sprawl.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Still hoping to develop his entire property, including land zoned as
farmland, Mr. Ferrao met with environmentalists and agreed to reduce the
density of the project. Instead of 9,000 homes allowed on the original
property, he reduced it to 6,000 on the combined acreage.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Conservancy of Southwest Florida wanted further concessions.
Among them: The group asked Mr. Ferrao to not develop one corner of the
property so wildlife could move freely from the preserve within his
property into the adjacent Rookery Bay sanctuary. He agreed.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
He also agreed to restore natural vegetation and allow water to flow
across the Fiddler's Creek property and nurture the mangroves in the
sanctuary to the south -- water flow that had been blocked when the land
was used for farming. That has turned out to be as much an opportunity
as a concession, Mr. Ferrao concedes. To create the water flow, he is
building the creek system, creating more waterfront home sites. For each
square foot of creek frontage, he can add $3,000 to a home price --
helping to offset the cost of the $15 million creek system.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Conservancy raised no formal objections when the development won
approval from local government bodies in 1997. "It is not our policy to
object to everything that comes through," says Michael Simonik, the
Conservancy's vice president of environmental policy. "It is our policy
to work with developers to offer solutions to some of the concerns we
have." Besides, he adds, the group earlier had won restrictions on
development on part of the property -- excluding the farmland -- as part
of its settlement with Deltona. "We already had had that fight."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But Ms. Payton of the Florida Wildlife Federation says her group
stuck by its objections -- unsuccessfully -- before the local planning
board and the county commission. She still thinks Fiddler's Creek set a
negative precedent that is prompting further eastward movement of
development into rural areas of Collier County.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"It vexes me that they're marketing themselves for their environment
when they've had significant negative impact on the environment," Ms.
Payton says.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
She asserts that the Conservancy's tacit support of Fiddler's Creek
might be influenced by the developer's annual $1,000 personal gift to
the group and an additional $1,000 donation in his company's name.
"We're a deeper shade of green than they are," she says.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Keeping Distance
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Simonik says that corporate sponsorship has played no role in the
Conservancy's dealings with Gulf Bay Cos. He also notes that the
Conservancy turned down the developer's offer to build a nature center
at Fiddler's Creek -- to be operated by the environmental group --
because it feared being seen as too close to the developer. "Some may
call us sell-outs or whatever," he says, "but we try to work with the
developer to minimize the impacts."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Now the Conservancy hopes its work with Mr. Ferrao will produce a new
band of environmental crusaders to help preserve other area wetlands. "I
would hope that Fiddler's Creek would become an advocate of the Rookery
Bay estuary and the Ten Thousand Islands," Mr. Simonik says. There is
precedent for that in the Naples area: When the mangroves next to
Pelican Bay began dying a few years ago because of road-building
projects, condo residents led efforts to try to do something about it.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
One new recruit may be Cynthia Valeri. She never thought of herself
as a "nature person," she says, before she and her husband bought a
vacation home in Fiddler's Creek two years ago. During twice-monthly
visits from their home in Marblehead, Mass., she started each morning by
walking to a nearby gazebo "to sit and watch the birds." Now they're
selling their first home there -- on a golf course -- in favor of one
facing the marshes and outfitted with a canoe dock.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Says Ms. Valeri, "I even bought a couple of books that I can use to
identify the birds."

READING THE REAL-ESTATE INDEX
Luxury Homes Index: shows price changes of an area's most expensive
houses. Actual prices vary greatly from city to city. The index shows,
however, that luxury homes are up 32% in Detroit; but up 44% in
Seattle. Put another way: A Washington, D.C., area home selling for $1
million in 1996 is, on average, worth $1,350,000 today; that year's
$500,000 Denver mansion is now worth $815,000.
MARKET SNAPSHOT: graphically highlights a metropolitan area and
indicates how all home values there have performed over five years
when compared to national prices and the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON -- Sales of new homes in the U.S. soared in September by a
surprising 9.2% to the highest level in six months as reduced mortgage
rates encouraged buyers to lock in deals. But consumer confidence fell
sharply in October to its lowest point in a year.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Americans purchased new single-family homes at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 946,000 in September, the highest level since a rate of
947,000 homes in March, the U.S. Commerce Department said. The 9.2%
increase, the largest since an 11% rise in July, wasn't expected. Many
analysts were predicting new-home sales would fall by 0.7%.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In a second report, the New York-based Conference Board said its
Consumer Confidence Index fell to 135.2 in October, a steep drop from
the revised 142.5 reported in September and the record of 144.7
registered in May and January.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The drop is a potentially worrisome sign for the approaching holiday
retail season.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Conference Board index, based on a monthly survey of some 5,000
U.S. households, is closely watched because consumer spending accounts
for about two-thirds of the economic activity in the U.S. The index
compares results with its base year, 1985, when it stood at 100. In the
housing report, new-home sales fell 5.8% in August, according to revised
figures, a weaker performance than the 3% drop the government reported
one month ago.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
There's a development in San Francisco where the highest bid on a
residential unit doesn't win the sale.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Last month, when the 233 luxury condominium units at a bayside
development across from Pacific Bell Park went on sale, the owner made
the unusual pledge to sell them for the listed prices of between
$750,000 and $2.3 million on a first-come, first-served basis.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Heading off bidding wars for residential property is "great for
buyers," but "crazy" for the seller, given what people now are willing
to pay, says Jeannie Anderson, president of the San Francisco
Association of Realtors. While the number of offers on properties has
dropped to about five to 10 from 30 to 40 earlier this year, "prices are
still outrageous," because of the city's extremely low inventory, she
says. In September, the median price in San Francisco hit $480,000, up
from $390,000 a year earlier, according to DataQuick Information
Systems, a La Jolla firm that tracks real-estate activity.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Currently, San Francisco homes sell for about 10% above the asking
price, Ms. Anderson says. However, some sellers apparently believe they
deserve more. "In the last few months, there have been properties that
have come on the market . . . and the sellers won't take any of the
offers," says Ms. Anderson. One home, she says, went on the market for
$875,000 and bidding pushed the price up to nearly $900,000, but the
sellers wouldn't take less than $1 million.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Even without that sale, continued home-price appreciation in
Oakland-San Francisco, San Jose, San Diego and Orange County boosted the
California Home-Price Index, which measures the inflation-adjusted
median prices for new and existing homes compared with 1990 prices. In
August, the index rose to 99.9, a 1.1% increase from July, and a 6.7%
jump from a year earlier.

Plan to Alter
Survey Rule
Stirs Debate

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
AUSTIN -- A battle is brewing over "current survey" rules that govern
the surveying of land in most home sales, as title companies and
surveyors lobby the Texas Department of Insurance with plans for
rewriting the requirement.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A "current" survey is required by state regulators when certain
title-insurance policies are written. Lenders require home buyers to
obtain such insurance to cover any potential disputes over title and
property lines. State rules don't define what constitutes "current," but
the effect has been that each time a home is sold, a new survey is
taken.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Last April, Stewart Title Guaranty Co., Houston, told its agents that
they could accept a survey of any date along with an affidavit from the
owner confirming there hadn't been any changes affecting the property's
area and boundaries.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Jim Gosdin, senior vice president and senior underwriting counsel for
Stewart, says the company felt the approach was within the definition of
"current survey." Stewart thought it would lower closing costs and win
customers by not always requiring a new survey. Although assumption of
the survey cost is negotiable between the buyer and the seller, Mr.
Gosdin says most of the time the $200 to $400 survey bill is paid by the
buyer.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But other title insurers -- some of whom, like Stewart, own surveying
concerns -- were dismayed. One competitor, United General Title
Insurance Co. of Denver, asked the Department of Insurance whether
Stewart's interpretation was correct.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Now, the department has decided a rule overhaul is in order, and next
month plans to publish a proposal for rewriting the rule. That
publication will trigger a 30-day comment period, which will be followed
by a public hearing before Commissioner Jose Montemayor.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Even before the public-comment period opens, Deputy Insurance
Commissioner Robert Carter says he is being heavily lobbied on the
issue. He says he has received about 40 phone calls, most from angry
surveyors. "I'll be glad when it's put to bed," he says.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
On one side, Stewart Title has asked to have its strategy made the
state norm. And First American Title Insurance Co. of Texas, a
subsidiary of First American Corp., Santa Ana, Calif., is already
supporting Stewart's proposal. So is Public Insurance Counsel Rod
Bordelon, who heads an independent state agency charged with
representing insurance consumers.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"It's an unnecessary cost to continue surveying the same tract of
land over and over again," Mr. Bordelon says.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
However, two important industry groups, the Texas Land Title
Association and the Texas Society of Professional Surveyors, are
proposing a much more modest change in the "current survey" regulation.
Their proposal would allow the use of existing surveys up to two years
old if the property being sold is in a platted subdivision -- meaning
mapped property lines are on file with a county clerk. For unplatted
acreage, a new survey would be required.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Tom Rutledge, an Austin attorney who represents the Texas Land Title
Association, says the insurers and surveyors are willing to compromise
-- to a point.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"We want to preserve the reliability of the process in terms of safe
and sound underwriting of title insurance," says Mr. Rutledge. "At the
same time, we want to find alternatives to the necessity of getting a
brand-new survey in every circumstance."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Rob Schneider, a senior staff attorney for Consumer's Union, wrote to
Deputy Insurance Commissioner Robert Carter Oct. 11 that the surveyors'
proposal "would be more expensive than current practice under the
existing rule and far more expensive than the Stewart and [Office of
Public Insurance Counsel] proposals." He notes that the surveyors'
proposal would require new surveys after two years even on refinancings,
while the Insurance Department allows the use of a survey up to seven
years old on refinancings.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Gosdin of Stewart Title says the surveyors' proposal would have a
"negligible effect" because the average home resale is five to seven
years and because it applies only to platted property. (Most residential
subdivisions are platted, but homes with acreage often aren't.)
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
He adds that Stewart Title's experience shows that only 7% of claims
arise over area-and-boundary disputes, the sort that could be detected
by a survey. "Historically, claims have not been affected in any
significant way by whether we have a survey or give coverage without a
survey," he says. "It's not a substantial risk we're undertaking."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Rutledge says it benefits both the seller and buyer to know if a
neighbor's fence has encroached on the property or if there have been
any other boundary changes. Such disputes can delay closing or even
prompt a lawsuit.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"Is it cheaper to know? Or would you rather take the risk down the
road?" he asks.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
For the first time in nearly 40 years, real-estate buyers in Florida
have the opportunity to negotiate lower rates on title insurance thanks
to a Florida Supreme Court ruling. But rate relief will depend largely
on how much a property is worth or who the seller is.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In a 5-1 decision last week, the state's high court ruled that a
Florida law banning title-insurance agents from offering rate reductions
-- or rebates -- was unconstitutional.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"The anti-rebate statutes do not achieve the Legislature's avowed
purposes and instead simply deprive the consuming public of a choice in
the price of products or services, the choice of which is the
cornerstone of a competitive, free-market economy," the court's majority
opinion said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Clark Butler, a Gainesville commercial developer, had challenged the
rebate ban in 1994, asserting what he paid for title insurance on land
for proposed shopping centers was too high. A Leon County circuit court
sided with Mr. Butler last year and the title industry's appeal went to
the Supreme Court.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The title-insurance industry was surprised the court rejected its
argument that rebates would lead to poor underwriting by agents and
threaten insurer solvency. "There will be a fair amount of turmoil in
the industry," says Norwood Gay, general counsel for Attorneys' Title
Insurance Fund Inc., Orlando, the state's largest title insurer with
about 6,000 independent attorney agents. "We have to look at everything
in a new light."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Title insurance protects a buyer of real estate against prior
ownership disputes, legal claims against the property or any mistakes in
the deed. Mortgage lenders require it at closing to limit their own
risk.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Officials at the Florida Department of Insurance and the Florida Home
Builders Association both supported Mr. Butler's challenge before the
high court on the grounds that title insurance rates are too high in
Florida, and buyers should be able to negotiate a lower price. A
consultant hired by the state reported that Florida's average
title-insurance premium in 1996 was as much as 40% higher than the
national average of $3.21 per thousand dollars of insured value.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Most other states already let market competition determine
title-insurance rates, and regulators only step in to ensure rates don't
drop too low. But Florida sets the rates title insurers and their agent
must charge. For instance, the buyer of a $100,000 home pays $575 in
title insurance. The same coverage for a $25 million commercial property
costs $56,325. Those rates are frozen under state law until June 2002
and aren't affected by the court's ruling.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But agents can now offer rebates on their portion of the established
premium. On property worth $1 million or below, the agent pockets 70%
and title insurer receives the rest. Over $1 million, the agent takes
60% or 65% of the premium.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Title-industry officials expect developers and major landowners
buying properties valued at $1 million or more to cash in immediately
and significantly on their new negotiating power. Some title agents may
forgo as much as two-thirds of their 70% commission to nab high-dollar
transactions, insurers say.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"On the larger transactions, I think rebates will happen fairly
quickly and it will snowball," says Keith Hetrick, general counsel for
the Florida Home Builders Association in Tallahassee.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
For home buyers, rate relief will be spottier. Title agents won't
likely compete over price for individual home sales under $300,000, says
Mr. Hetrick. Florida's rate of $575 for a $100,000 home plus an
additional $300 to $600 in related title and closing costs are in line
with charges across the nation, insurers say.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
However, Floridians who buy a home from a builder developing a large
subdivision of 100 homes or more may get a discount on title insurance
at closing. Title agents would be inclined to give a discount to a
builder developing a large tract of land because their title search for
adjacent homes is simplified. Under federal law, a builder would be
compelled to disclose his volume discount at closing and pass it all on
to the home buyer, says Mr. Hetrick.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Home builders could pocket some savings for themselves, though. Many
builders pay for title insurance several times related to the same
property within a matter of months as they buy the land, take out a
construction loan and conduct other transactions. Builders receive
certain credits in those instances, but they think negotiations will
drive insurance rates even lower.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Of course, some builders and real-estate agents get no benefit from
rates dropping because they are partners in or owners of their own title
agency. The state's largest builders own title agencies.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But while welcoming the court ruling, state insurance regulators
worry agents will discriminate against buyers when issuing the rebates.
In 1999, state lawmakers eliminated any reference in Florida law to
title-insurance rebates, including an antidiscrimination clause, in an
effort to strengthen the title industry's case against Mr. Butler's
court challenge.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Because of that, says Don Dowdell, the insurance department's
director of legal services, title agents can now pick and choose who
receives a rebate based on how much property they are buying, the
property's location or even the color of their skin.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"They could give it on a million-dollar home and not on a $100,000
one," says Mr. Dowdell. "On commercial, but not residential. For whites,
but not for blacks or Hispanics. We ought to do something that says if
you rebate you can't discriminate based on dollar volume or any other
consideration. If you rebate to one person, you should give it to
everybody."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
State legislators will have to amend the insurance code next spring
to reflect the court's ruling, and defining rebate discrimination is
bound to come up. Home builders and title-insurance representatives
agree rebates should be offered fairly, but they don't see a problem
withholding them based on property value.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Rebates are a new issue for everyone involved. Florida's
anti-rebating law for title insurance apparently dates back to 1961,
says Mr. Dowdell.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Given that long history, Tom Guilday, a Tallahassee attorney
representing Mr. Butler, expects a battle in the next session as the
title industry tries to turn back some of the court's ruling. "The
current system has been in place for so long."

Vanity Fair editor in chief Graydon Carter just put his Washington,

New York City, bought the Colonial-style, white clapboard house, built
in 1773, in 1987. It measures 3,590 square feet and has five bedrooms,
four maids' rooms, two baths, a large kitchen with built-in banquettes,
and a screened porch. The home was renovated in 1991. Mr. Carter also
owns a smaller home in the same area. The asking price is $995,000.
Carolyn Klemm, of Klemm Real Estate in Washington, Conn., has the

One of Southampton's best-known historic homes is for sale. The house
was built in the late 19th century for a son of Dr. T. Gaillard Thomas,
a gynecologist whose clients were mostly wealthy socialites. The asking
price for the nine-bedroom, 2 1/2-story brick house is $6.75 million.
Laura Nigro, of Dunemere Associates in Southampton, has the listing. Dr.
Thomas built the first Southampton beach house in 1877, and encouraged
his patients to vacation in the area. No doubt he would be shocked to
see what he started: The average sale price of a home in the Hamptons
jumped 30% to $656,914 for the first half of 2000, according to
brokerage Cook Pony Farm's midyear report. Prices have soared so high
that Steven Gorrie, author of "What My Hairdresser Knows," a novel due
out next month, recently sold his small one-bedroom cottage overlooking
a pond in Sag Harbor for $350,000. "I couldn't believe it," says Mr.

Why the Latino Market Is So Hard to Count
</span>
</div><div class="author">
By Eduardo Porter
</div><div>Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</div>
<div>632 words</div><div>13 October 2000</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>

</div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Everybody agrees the Latino market is hot. Yet no one can quite get a
handle on just how hot -- or how big -- it is.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Hispanic Business, a magazine frequently cited for its market data,
puts the purchasing power of Latinos in America at $273 billion a year.
Strategy Research Co., a Miami-based market research firm, says $325
billion. Standard &amp; Poors/DRI ups the ante to $445 billion.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The uncertainty extends beyond the size of the pie. When it comes to
tracking Latinos, accurate information on everything from the products
they prefer to the TV shows they watch is scarce. Even collecting data
on how much companies spend to advertise to Hispanics is "a crap shoot,"
says Peter Roslow of Roslow Research Group, a Port Washington, N.Y.,
firm that measures the effectiveness of Spanish-language campaigns for
big advertisers.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Hispanic market has been difficult to measure partly because of
language and education differences. Also, the group includes a large
number of illegal immigrants who can be wary of answering marketing
questions.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
One way research firms track what consumers spend and buy is by
setting up scanners in homes and stores that survey participants use to
scan in the bar codes of their purchases. Ken Greenberg, a marketing
director at ACNielsen, says setting up such market-research scanners in
Hispanic communities is much more expensive than in a general-market
group.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In other communities, the scanners are mailed. But in Latino
neighborhoods, because of the language differences, ACNielsen sends
people door to door to train families on how to use the machines.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"You can't just leave a meter in the house and hope things will go
all right," says Felipe Korzenny, co-founder of the ethnic
market-research firm Cheskin Research. But even after training, he says,
there tends to be high turnover in families participating in the sample
of Hispanic households.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Undercounting of the Hispanic population is another problem.
Spanish-language TV networks, for example, say their audience in U.S.
markets is larger than those reported by VNU Inc.'s Nielsen Media
Research. Nielsen has acknowledged that it undercounts Spanish-speaking
viewers and to address the problem, it has started periodically
adjusting the weight it assigns them in samples.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Hispanic advertising agencies have also complained that Hispanic
consumer spending is under-recorded by the firms that collect such data,
which advertisers use to gauge the effectiveness of their campaigns and
determine how much they pay ad agencies.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"A large percentage of Hispanic sales are done in small neighborhood
stores without scanners," says Joe Zubizarreta, executive vice president
of Hispanic agency Zubi Advertising, who feels that some research
companies are wary of going into Hispanic neighborhoods.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
To be sure, research is improving as advertisers allocate more
dollars to reach Latino households. Besides Nielsen Media's change in
sampling techniques, ACNielsen has set up a Hispanic group of 725 Los
Angeles households to see what people are buying.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Surprisingly, determining how much companies are spending to
advertise to the fast-growing Latino communities is difficult. Companies
are notoriously reluctant to reveal such spending. And research firms
and industry associations that publish ad-spending data don't compile
the same breadth of information for the Hispanic market. In fact, the
monthly magazine Hispanic Business has emerged as the source of record
for ad spending in the Hispanic market -- on the strength of its
five-member research team.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Even Hispanic Business, however, acknowledges that getting exact
numbers is difficult. "We are subject to what people report to us," says
Jesus Chavarria, founder and publisher of the Santa Barbara,
Calif.-based magazine. "Businesses are losing commericial opportunities
because of the lack of data."

Campus Housing Crunch Sends
Kids Into Pricey Private Digs;
Make Way for the Beer Kegs
</span>
</div><div class="author">
By June Fletcher

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
CATHARINE CLARKE, cash-strapped college student, just got strapped
further: Thanks to a shortage of campus housing, she's renting a cramped
one-bedroom apartment that costs her almost $1,500 a year more than a
dorm room.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"It's  a definite crunch," says Ms. Clarke, an 18-year-old sophomore
at Washington College in Chestertown, Md.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
An acute housing crunch has hit campuses across the U.S., as children
of Baby Boomers flock to school in record numbers. Enrollment in U.S.
colleges is up one million from 1990 and will continue to swell
throughout this decade. The undergraduate upsurge is catching most
schools off guard: From Boston to Puget Sound, universities just don't
have room for them all. So students are overflowing the dorms, filling
up temporary housing and spilling into the surrounding neighborhoods.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"We're bursting at the seams," says Maureen McIntyre, a dean at
Washington College.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A demographic wave is cresting -- and nearly everyone's getting
soaked. Just when parents thought university bills couldn't get any
higher, they did: Off-campus housing already costs more than dorm
accommodations, and the newest crunch is pushing rents even higher in
university neighborhoods. Residents of college towns are griping, too,
when they learn that the new kid on the block is an 18-year-old freshman
with a boom box and a beer keg.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Over the last three years, Lane Cooper, 35, has watched the quality
of life in his Washington, D.C., neighborhood go downhill. Once filled
with family homes, neat lawns and backyard swing sets, Burleith, near
Georgetown University, has been invaded by students that he says litter,
ignore home maintenance and party too much. The highlight of one recent
bash: So many revelers crowded onto the deck of a house a couple doors
down that it collapsed.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But oddly enough, the shabbier his neighborhood gets, the more his
home is worth. Tight housing conditions are pushing up rents, and, by
extension, home prices. Homes like Mr. Cooper's 1920s brick townhouse,
which he bought in 1997 for $258,000, are now selling for an average of
$279,500 -- an 8.3% gain, compared with a 4.8% rise in the Washington
metropolitan area overall for the same period. Though that may be a boon
should he decide to sell, in the short run, it means higher property
taxes.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
And the worst is yet to come. According to the Department of
Education, enrollments in kindergarten through 12th grade hit a record
53.2 million last year and will swell until 2006. College enrollment was
at 14.9 million last year and is expected to hit 16.3 million by 2009.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The bulge began to make headlines in the mid-1990s, when Princeton
University in Princeton, N.J., had to lodge a number of students in
mobile homes parked on campus. (The problem: More freshmen than ever had
accepted the school's offer. Princeton has since built a big new dorm.)
This fall, Monmouth College, in West Long Branch, N.J., put up about 10%
of its incoming freshman class in a hotel a few miles away. Cornell
University, in Ithaca, N.Y., ran out of regular dorm space for its
freshmen and installed beds for 60 of them in student lounges.
Washington College, which opened a 96-bed dormitory just two years ago
and has more beds on the way, also is housing freshmen in converted dorm
lounges. Like colleges everywhere, it has encouraged its upperclassmen
to find off-campus housing.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
And that has locals fuming. The griping is perhaps loudest in
college-studded Boston, where there are about 35,000 more students than
there are dorm beds to accommodate them. "Our affordable housing is
being eaten up," says Stephen J. Murphy, a city councilman-at-large. He
explains that landlords often favor students over families, because by
renting individual rooms to students, they can pull in three times as
much as they would get renting the entire house. His proposal: Charge
universities $1,000 per semester for each student they can't house on
campus, and use the money to build affordable housing.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But universities are in a bind, too. Though the neighbors usually
don't like students next door, they've also tended to oppose
construction of big new buildings in their backyards. Getting funds and
approval for new construction takes years, so some schools appear to be
riding out the wave without erecting new residences. At the University
of Colorado at Boulder, where student enrollment has been swelling
steadily, "they haven't built a dorm room in decades," says Leslie
Durgin, a senior development officer.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Others have new residences in the works. At the University of Puget
Sound in Tacoma, Wash., where roughly half of the students live off
campus, there are plans to open a new dorm two years from now. But
associate dean for student development Jim Hoppe worries that even that
might not be enough: "The problems are not likely to go away soon."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Although many colleges make an effort to house younger students,
graduate students are often left to scramble. Danielle van Jaarsveld, a
graduate student at Cornell, pays $660 for a one-bedroom apartment near
the university, but says that similar on-campus digs -- if she could get
them -- would cost about $200 less. Princeton graduate student Bei Hu
says the housing market near that university is so tight and pricey that
many of his fellow students have taken to sleeping in their friends'
living rooms.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In Ivy League towns, housing costs are also pushed higher because of
another university-related problem: New graduates move to these
neighborhoods to take jobs at the high-tech companies that tend to
gravitate there. In Cambridge, Mass., home of both Harvard University
and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, home prices have grown
16.2% over the past year, compared with 12.9% for the Boston
metropolitan area as a whole, according to Cambridge-based economic
research firm Case Shiller Weiss. That's especially hard on elderly and
disadvantaged residents who want to rent or buy housing, says Paul
Turcotta, a local real-estate agent.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Some parents are trying to blunt the financial trauma by buying a
place outright for their children. That's what Wayne and Heather Hall
did when they decided that three of their four children would attend the
University of Cincinnati, where Mr. Hall is an associate dean. The
couple paid about $50,000 for a 1,200-square-foot bungalow close to the
college. Although the house is old and needs major repairs, the Halls
are gambling they'll turn a profit when finally sell. In the meantime,
Mrs. Hall says, they will recoup some of their investment with the rent
they will collect from their children. Each will be required to kick in
$300 a month.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Elsewhere, surplus students are fending for themselves -- and
learning some real-life lessons along the way. At Washington College,
Ms. Clarke is working as a waitress after classes to help pay for her
$450-a-month apartment. And senior Jennifer Lubkin has taken a part-time
clerical job, and doubled up with a roommate to save money. It's not
quite how Ms. Lubkin imagined college life. "We eat a lot of rice and
beans," she says.

however, that luxury homes are up 30% in Detroit and up 45% in Seattle.
Put another way: A Washington, D.C., area home selling for $1 million
in 1996 is, on average, worth $1.38 million today; that year's
$500,000 Denver mansion is now worth $720,000.

Housing Is Missing in U.S. Campaign

Issue Gets Little Room on Agendas of Presidential Candidates

`Policy Is Complex, the Programs Are Hard to Explain and Understand'

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Not too long ago, affordable housing was one of the most pressing
domestic issues in the U.S. Now, high rents and prices bedevil
significant parts of the country as never before. When it comes to
housing policy during the current presidential campaign, however, it
seems as if nobody is home.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Although both major candidates have housing-policy proposals, neither
talks about the subject much. Even the two parties' most high-profile
housing advocates bemoan their candidates' treatment of the issue.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"I think it's lamentable," says former U.S. President Jimmy Carter,
taking a break recently from swinging a hammer in Harlem in New York
City for the nonprofit Habitat for Humanity, which builds and renovates
low-cost homes. "Candidates tend to speak about things they generally
know are popular. There are many hard-working families living in
substandard housing, which is a shame in our country, but there's very
little attention being paid to it."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Jack Kemp, secretary of housing and urban development during the Bush
administration, was similarly bewildered by the candidates' housing
proposals. "If they had anything exciting in them, they would be talking
about it," he says. "I honestly am perplexed... I don't think you can go
to a city in the United States of America and not see this issue front
and center."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The problem certainly hasn't gone away, the economic boom
notwithstanding. In fact, good times may be exacerbating the problem.
The housing market hasn't kept up with the economy's unprecedented
growth in pockets of the country, including the New York area, Seattle,
Washington, and San Francisco's Silicon Valley. That is because it is
hard to build homes quickly enough to keep up with demand. Newly
affluent home buyers bid up prices on existing homes and price out the
middle class, which then bids up the rental market and prices out
lower-income families.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Rising prices also put pressure on federal rent-subsidy programs,
because landlords can get much more on the open market than what
subsidies pay. A 1999 Department of Housing and Urban Development study
found about one million families in 40 cities on waiting lists for
public housing or rent subsidies. At the bottom of the economy, the
nonpartisan Urban Institute says, there were 842,000 homeless people on
the street in any given night in 1996 (the most recent year available),
up from about 600,000 in 1987.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"Affordable housing is an issue not just for the homeless but for
many, many of the economic tiers in America," says Mary Ann Gleason, a
housing-policy analyst at the National Coalition for the Homeless.
"Middle-class people in Silicon Valley who are homeless. Single people
who are moving back home with their parents because they can't afford
rent. Young couples who expected to be homeowners by now but can't
afford to buy. There's clearly not enough commitment to housing."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In some ways, the candidates' lack of focus on the issue reflects the
federal government's weaker emphasis on it, as the focus on large,
expensive public-housing projects has given way to more limited rental
subsidies. HUD's annual budget totaled $36 billion in 1980; it stands at
$26 billion today. "People don't expect the federal government to have a
role anymore," Mr. Carter says.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
There are other explanations for why housing isn't a more prominent
issue in this election. The candidates prefer to talk about
easier-to-fathom issues, including Social Security, education and health
care, especially prescription-drug costs. Since housing shortages affect
only select geographic areas, much of the country mistakenly believes
housing is an issue only for the poor, says Republican Rep. James Walsh
of New York, who heads HUD's appropriations subcommittee.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"Housing policy is complex, the programs are hard to explain and
understand," says Mr. Walsh, who last week announced the creation of a
bipartisan commission to study housing issues. "It doesn't resonate with
the vast majority of voters. Most voters have pretty comfortable -- or
at least adequate -- housing."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
During past years, housing had greater political salience. Former
President Ronald Reagan spent much of his presidency trying to rein in
spending on housing programs, but he paid a political price as the
economy slowed and homelessness grew. George Bush, trying to be kinder
and gentler, pledged increased funding for programs for the homeless and
made Mr. Kemp, one of the Republican Party's most outspoken and popular
figures, housing secretary.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
By the late 1990s, the issue had reached the middle class, as home
prices put ownership out of reach for many. But while there is no
shortage of housing proposals floating around, none has gained much
public notice -- or momentum. President Bill Clinton's budget proposed
giving HUD its largest increase in 20 years, $6 billion, for a total of
$32.1 billion in fiscal 2001. Spending bills pending in Congress
appropriate somewhat less, about $30 billion, including funding for a
new "21st Century Housing Fund" that would finance HUD's first major
new-rental construction-subsidy program since 1973. The House,
meanwhile, has approved a major reauthorization of federal housing
programs with provisions aimed at expanding homeownership; whether the
Senate will get to it before Congress adjourns is unclear.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The presidential campaigns of Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov.
George W. Bush have both backed an increased federal role, though
neither addresses the issue much.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The homebuilding market is cooling but hardly crashing.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Residential construction in the Southeast declined for the second
straight month in July. Most states posted double-digit declines in
building permits compared with last year's June and July.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"That's not surprising as interest rates have gone up" over the past
year, says Mary Kassis, associate director of the Economic Forecasting
Center at the Georgia State University. But she and other economists
note building remains at a relatively high level -- just not at the
supercharged pace of the past two years.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the Atlanta metro area, Ms. Kassis predicts total housing permits
still will show modest growth for all of 2000 compared with 1999, thanks
partly to a spurt in apartment construction after suburban Gwinnett
County eased multi-family building restrictions. Then overall building
permits will decline "moderately" in 2001 and 2002, she adds.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In South Carolina, a drop in residential construction was the "most
notable negative" in June's index of leading indicators compiled by
University of South Carolina economist Don Schunk. But it's equally
notable that construction has not cooled along the state's coastline
because of a growing retiree population.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Even in the Greenville-Spartanburg and Columbia areas, where
residential-construction slowing is more pronounced, many builders
welcomed the breather "to get caught up on jobs they've been putting off
for a while," says Mr. Schunk. Indeed, statewide construction
employment, including commercial and industrial building, increased 5%,
or 5,800 jobs, between August 1990 and August 2000. "There's no shortage
of work for contractors," he adds. "Strip malls are still popping up
like crazy" in suburban Columbia's Lexington County.

Home Sales Pause,

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Home sales this summer were hot. Just not as hot as last year.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Sure, the median home price hit $212,000 in California last month, an
all-time high, according to DataQuick Information Systems. Still, from
May to August, when home sales typically are the strongest, slightly
more than 201,000 homes sold, a nearly 3% drop from the same period last
year.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"Everyone wants to know if we're turning a corner," says John
Karevoll, an analyst at DataQuick, a La Jolla-based firm that tracks
real-estate activity. "But there's no indication of a fundamental
problem." The typical warning signs -- smaller down payments and a
migration to adjustable-rate mortgages from fixed-rate ones -- aren't
there. Instead, he chalks up the sales drop to an inventory shortage.
"People are willing and able to buy homes, but there's not a lot of
homes on the market right now."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But James Gikas, a senior vice president at Recon Research Corp., a
Los Angeles economic consulting firm that compiles the California Home
Sales Index for The Wall Street Journal, chalks up the slowdown to the
run-up in mortgage interest rates in May on inflation fears. Rates have
since declined, and Mr. Gikas predicts that "atypically large sales" may
come at year's end as potential home buyers who postponed their
purchases because of high mortgage-rate concerns are lured back into the
market. He adds that the continuing rise in home prices is likely to
spur more new home construction.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
However, home sales are the hottest in those areas of the state where
the prices are the lowest. While home sales in August dropped in the Bay
Area and remained flat in Southern California, they surged in the Inland
Empire, the Central Valley and Sacramento. Those areas, says Mr.
Karevoll, helped push August homes sales to nearly 52,000, the strongest
August since 1989.

In U.S. Gets Boost

Existing-Home Sales Revive
With 9.3% August Increase

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON -- Sales of previously owned houses in the U.S. rose 9.3%
in August, as homebuyers took advantage of recent declines in borrowing
costs.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The National Association of Realtors said existing-home sales climbed
to an annual rate of 5.27 million last month. That followed a big
decline in July, when sales fell a revised 9.2% to 4.82 million.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Wall Street expected a rebound in August -- 10 economists polled by
Dow Jones Newswires and CNBC predicted sales would jump 4.4% in August
to a rate of five million. The August figures, however, aren't likely to
have much impact on financial markets amid investors' widespread
expectation that the U.S. Federal Reserve will leave interest rates
unchanged for the rest of the year.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"Clearly, affordable interest rates are the biggest key to the
strength in this year's housing market," said David Leareah, chief
economist at the Realtors' association.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In August, the rate on a conventional 30-year mortgage in the U.S.
dropped beneath 8% for the first time since December. Last week, the
rate was 7.90%, according to Freddie Mac, a government-sponsored
mortgage enterprise.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"Not only have lower interest rates buoyed housing demand, as
measured by mortgage applications for home purchases, but it has boosted
mortgage refinancing -- up over 50% from the end of May," said Geoffrey
Somes, an economist at FleetBoston Financial.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Realtors' association said the supply of available homes on the
U.S. market fell to 3.7 months in August from a revised level of 4.3
months in July.

Dell Sells
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Adam Dell, younger brother of Dell Computer founder Michael Dell, has
put his SoHo loft in a luxury condominium building on the market, people
familiar with the situation say.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Dell, 30 years old, left a partnership at Silicon Valley's
Crosspoint Ventures in 1999 to move to New York's Silicon Alley to form
Impact Venture Partners, a venture-capital firm that invests in the
early stages of the development of Internet-related products and
services.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The loft measures about 4,100 square feet and has mahogany floors and
a large, 15th-century French Gothic fireplace, purchased from the Art
Institute of Chicago. The asking price is $6.7 million.  Douglas Elliman
has the listing.

At Home at Sea
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Richard Reed, founder of ASF International, health-club software and
services company, bought a $2 million condo that's a little different
from your average retirement home: It floats. It's one of 110
residential apartments being built on a 644-foot ship called The World
developed by Miami-based ResidenSea. The ship, due to launch next
December from Oslo, will also have 88 guest suites  and a
round-the-world itinerary. It will stop in ports for about 250 days each
year. On-board amenities include putting greens, a jogging track and a
business center. It "doesn't appeal to just anyone," says Mr. Reed, 59,
who likes sailing and doesn't mind retiring to a home that comes with
lifeboat drills. "I picture myself having morning coffee and looking out
at Istanbul," he says. "I really like the idea of traveling and taking
my home with me." Another plus, he says, is that his daughters can visit
him and stay on board at no cost.

Left Bank on the Left Coast
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Donald R. Stephens, founder of the Bank of San Francisco, a private
bank, and his fiancee, interior designer Patricia Parsons Hamilton of
Parsons Designs, have purchased a four-story townhouse in San
Francisco's Pacific Heights for about $3 million, people familiar with
the deal say. The couple is spending another $3 million to restore the
house and decorate its interior to resemble a formal Parisian residence.
Ms. Hamilton is the decorator, and the couple have made a few trips to
country antique shops in France. Last year, the couple finished building
an 8,000-square-foot French-style house in St. Helena in Napa Valley
that comes with a 10-acre vineyard. The couple are putting the grapes to
work: A spokesman for the vineyard, D.R. Stephens Estate, says the first
vintage to come to market -- in the spring of 2001 -- will be its 1999
Chardonnay.

  Cutting Costs
  Soaring property prices could actually save you money. Many
homeowners may be needlessly paying private mortgage insurance, a
recent study shows. Lenders require this insurance for home buyers who
put less than 20% down . Borrowers can cancel the insurance when their
equity stake* reaches 20%, which has happened unusually fast in cities
with rising property values. Below,  cities in which homeowners who
bought with just 10% down three years ago may qualify for cancellation:

Housing Starts Rally Mildly in a Cool Market

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON -- Construction of new homes rebounded modestly last month
after a three-month decline, but the housing market remained cool
compared with its peak earlier this year.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Housing starts rose 0.3% during August, just short of analysts'
expectations. The Commerce Department said new construction rose to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.53 million homes, following a 2.9%
drop during July, revised from a 3.3% decline reported earlier. Compared
with the August 1999 level, however, housing starts are down 7.6%.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The housing sector is "leading in the softening process" of the
overall economy that was triggered by six Federal Reserve interest-rate
cuts beginning in June 1999, said David Seiders, chief economist at the
National Association of Home Builders.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
After four months of decline, construction of single-family units
rose 4.6% during August, in line with predictions. The growth may
reflect the steady drop of mortgage rates since May, a decline that may
not last. Rising oil prices are pushing yields on long-term Treasury
securities higher, and are "likely to increase mortgage rates," Mr.
Seiders said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Construction of buildings with five units or more, such as apartment
buildings, fell 17% during August, and permits for these buildings fell
22%. Multifamily units often fluctuate sharply from month to month, and
many economists expect a moderate rebound during September.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Building-permit applications fell 2.8% during August, following a
1.1% drop during July. The weakness in permits suggests continued
softness in the market.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"During the past year, housing starts are flat to down in all regions
of the country," said Karen Dexter, an economist at Merrill Lynch.
"Housing starts are likely to fall further in coming months."

U.S. Housing Starts Rose 0.3%
In August After 4-Month Slide

But Overall Level Is Down From a Year Earlier

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON -- Homebuilding activity picked up slightly in late summer,
but an overall easing in demand for new homes in the U.S. kept the level
of construction work on residences down from records in late 1999 and
early this year.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Builders broke ground on about 1.53 million homes in August, on a
seasonally adjusted basis, the U.S. Commerce Department said Tuesday, as
domestic housing construction edged up just 0.3% from the previous
month's level. The August increase in housing starts was the first in
four months.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
July housing starts were revalued at 1.53 million, off 2.9% from
June, Commerce said. The July level had been estimated at 1.512 million
new units started.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Government figures showed that single-family home construction, which
accounts for about two-thirds of all residential building, rose a strong
4.6% in August. Starts on apartment buildings and other multifamily
dwellings, however, fell a sharp 17.3% last month.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The direction of housing construction activity was generally in line
with market expectations, though analysts had been expecting a more
robust total figure. The median from a survey of 13 economists by Dow
Jones Newswires and CNBC was for an August housing-starts level of 1.55
million new units, an increase of 2.5% from July.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Adding to the evidence that housing demand has slackened, the number
of building permits registered last month, a good indication of future
demand, slipped 2.8% to a seasonally adjusted level of 1.47 million.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
By region, housing activity was strongest in the South, were builders
broke ground on more new homes in August, pushing the rate up 6.4%.
Starts in the Northeast also were higher, up 1.4%. In both the Midwest
and West, total construction on residential buildings in August fell
5.6% from a month earlier.

HUD Is Expanding
Its Subsidy Program
In Tightening Markets

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON -- As Congress heads for a showdown over public-housing
funds, the Department of Housing and Urban Development said it would
expand its subsidy program in 40 U.S. cities with tight housing markets.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Responding to an economic-boom-induced housing shortage for
low-income families, HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo said that the agency
would increase the pool of affordable apartments for rental-assistance
recipients who are being priced out of the market because of rising
rents.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The initiative, to be funded for the next year using $100 million
from HUD's reserve budget, would raise voucher rates so that half,
rather than 40%, of standard-quality rental units are accessible to
users. The measure is aimed at regions where the rental market is
particularly tight. "The cruel irony of these prosperous times is that
the economy is so strong that it has driven up housing costs," Mr. Cuomo
said. "As a matter of policy, more housing in different parts of a city
provides the opportunity for more integration and more mobility."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The announcement comes as the Senate prepares to consider HUD's 2001
budget. President Clinton wants an additional 120,000 vouchers for next
year to replace public-housing projects as they are demolished in cities
around the country and alleviate a growing low-income housing shortage,
even in small towns and rural areas. But many Republicans are resisting
a big increase in the number of vouchers, arguing that existing ones are
ineffective in a market where there aren't enough low-income units to
begin with."We must rebuild the nation's stock of affordable housing,"
Mr. Bond said in a statement. "And where there are no homes, we much
work to provide new construction."

Henley's Plum Deal
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Software giant Oracle's Chief Financial Officer Jeff Henley has
purchased a house in Santa Barbara, Calif., according to people familiar
with the deal. The approximately 20,000-square-foot house, known as Les
Mirabelles -- French for a type of yellow plum -- was built in the early
'90s. The design is described as contemporary French, and was inspired
by estates in the south of France. The most recent asking price for the
house was about $18 million; people familiar with the deal say Mr.
Henley paid more than $17 million. The property, which has ocean views
and a tennis court, spans nearly five acres.

C.C. Dyer, estranged wife of talk-show host (and possible mayoral
candidate) Geraldo Rivera, is buying a townhouse on New York's Upper
East Side, people familiar with the deal say. The former ABC News
producer -- separated from Mr. Rivera after a long marriage -- signed a
contract for the house, which had a $7.9 million asking price.
Meanwhile, a 10,000-square-foot Park Avenue house that once belonged to
Mrs. James Murphy, Nelson Rockefeller's mother-in-law, is on the market
for $14 million. The 25-room red brick Georgian mansion, built in 1920,
has a curved marble staircase, two kitchens, large formal dining room
and a full basement. Owner Sherman Cohen, a real-estate developer,
bought it from Mrs. Murphy's estate. Patricia Burnham, of New York's
P.S. Burnham Inc., has the listing.

Pace of Home Sales
To Continue to Cool

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Can't stand your neighbors? Well, don't expect them to be moving
anytime soon.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
So say economists, who expect a downturn in home sales in the
Northwest to continue. A glut of new housing, along with the Federal
Reserve's six interest-rate increases in the past 14 months, "will have
a cooling effect on home sales for at least the remainder of the year,"
says Tom Potiowsky, head of the Oregon Office of Economic Analysis in
Salem.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Home sales in the region increased by 0.1% in the first half,
compared with a 6% gain a year earlier and a 10% uptick for the same
period in 1998.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Although Alaska, Montana and Washington reported significantly slower
increases in sales, Oregon and Idaho notched decreases. Mr. Potiowsky
says an uptick in new homes in Portland's suburbs probably contributed
to Oregon's 4.88% decline in existing-home sales. A year earlier, the
state reported a 1.17% rise.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"An increase in new housing starts in some areas surrounding Portland
is going to be an overhanging problem," Mr. Potiowsky says, "because
there are still a lot of existing homes for sale."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Total sales in Idaho decreased 5.47%, compared with a 0.85% downturn
for the first six months of 1999. These softer home sales can be
attributed to a deceleration in income growth, making it more difficult
for Idahoans to afford new homes, according to Bob Poyer, an economist
at Economy.com, an economic-forecasting firm in West Chester, Pa.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Although Washington reported a 1.22% increase, compared with 7.56%
the previous year, the Seattle area's six-month average was humbling.
Sales declined 10.6% in King County between January and July, according
to Cheri Brennan, a spokeswoman for Seattle-based Northwest Multiple
Listing Service.

  READING THE REAL ESTATE INDEX
  Luxury Homes Index: shows price changes of an area's most expensive
houses. Actual prices vary greatly from city to city. The index shows,
however, that luxury homes are up 25% in Detroit; but up 37% in
Seattle. Put another way: A Washington, D.C., area home selling for $1
million in 1996 is, on average, worth $1,200,000 today; that year's
$500,000 Denver mansion is now worth $720,000.
  MARKET SNAPSHOT: graphically highlights a metropolitan area and
indicates how all home values there have performed over five years
when compared to national prices and the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
For the last three years, soaring home prices have significantly
driven down the number of residential foreclosures around the state.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Still, the Central Valley trails other regions in declines in
foreclosures. That's because unlike elsewhere, home values in the
Central Valley haven't returned to their high levels of the early 1990s,
says John Karevoll, an analyst at DataQuick Information Systems, a La
Jolla-based firm that tracks real-estate activity. In the Central
Valley, if homeowners fall behind on their mortgage payments, "they tend
to walk away" from their homes because they owe more on the property
than it's worth, he says. "Markets with low-cost homes are the markets
most at risk of loans, particularly subprime loans, going into default."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the Central Valley, 3,074 residential properties went into
foreclosure during the first six months of this year, a drop of only 20%
from the same period last year, according to DataQuick. Meanwhile,
foreclosures in Orange County during the first half of this year totaled
544, down nearly 45% from a year earlier; San Diego County posted a 41%
decline to 476 foreclosures; Los Angeles County recorded a 30% decrease
to 5,483 foreclosures; San Francisco County, a nearly 29% decline to
just 15; Santa Clara County, a drop of almost 28% to 57; the Inland
Empire, a 26% tumble to 4,967; and Sacramento County, a 25% decrease to
895.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The California Foreclosure Index, which measures seasonally-adjusted
residential foreclosures against 1993 levels, fell to 65.1 in June, down
0.6% from May and 27.5% from a year ago.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Although the index has been steadily falling since October 1997, the
monthly decline was the smallest since May 1998, says James Gikas, a
senior vice president at Recon Research Corp., which prepares the index
for The Wall Street Journal.

A Look at Cases
On the Agenda
For High Court

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
AUSTIN -- From home buyers' warranties to workers' compensation, the
Texas Supreme Court is taking on some cases in the coming session that
will have a big impact on businesses and consumers.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But the court's moves also could have a big impact just a hundred
yards away -- at the state Capitol.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
It's all in the timing: Some of the high court's potentially most
far-reaching decisions are likely to be handed down in the first half of
2001, when lawmakers will be in session for the first time since 1999.
So if legislators don't like the high court's decisions, they are likely
to spawn new laws to counter the rulings' effects.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"I don't believe the court generally looks at issues in terms of
legislative timing," says Eric Glenn, a governmental-affairs manager for
the Austin-based Texas Association of Business and Chambers of Commerce.
"But in some of these situations, the [coming session] is going to be
hard to ignore."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the past two years, the all-Republican court has become a less
predictably favorable forum for businesses and insurers. Just last week,
the court rejected a plea from the nursing-home industry to cap punitive
damages against such facilities and upheld an $11 million award against
a Fort Worth nursing home. That decision is expected to prompt the
nursing-home industry to ask for legislative relief from skyrocketing
insurance rates caused by large damage awards.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But the court has also struck some conservative notes. This past
term, the court narrowed the grounds for bringing a class-action lawsuit
by requiring the potential class members to show they have a substantial
number of issues in common.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Here's a look at some of the potentially significant cases the high
court has agreed to rule on in the coming session:
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Home Buyers' Warranties
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
On Nov. 29, the justices will hear arguments in a case that Texas
home builders claim will profoundly damage them by giving home buyers
too much leeway in suing builders for allegedly poor construction.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In Centex Homes and Centex Real Estate Corp. vs. Michael A. Buecher,
the Fourth Court of Appeals in San Antonio stunned the industry by
ruling that homeowners retain implied warranties for "good and
workmanlike construction and habitability" even if home builders have
them sign waivers.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In 1998, four San Antonio homeowners sued Centex Homes, a unit of
Dallas-based Centex, in the state district court in San Antonio for
foundation problems. They contended that the builder's warranty was too
narrow, and that no matter what their contracts with Centex said, they
were entitled to compensation for damages. The court rejected the home
buyers' claim.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The plaintiffs went to the Fourth Court of Appeals, which overturned
the decision, ruling that a standard of habitability "is a minimal" one
and that home buyers were entitled to protection no matter what rights
they signed away in purchase contracts.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Bryan Woods, the homeowners' lawyer in San Antonio, is seeking
certification for a class-action suit that could include 40,000
individuals who bought Centex homes between 1989 and 1999.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Home builders are a powerful lobbying force. So if this decision goes
against them, they're likely to push for a change in the law in the next
legislative session.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Workers' Compensation
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Employer groups and workers have their eye on Oct. 2, when the high
court will hear arguments in two workers' comp cases from lower
appellate courts.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Currently, employers who participate in the state workers' comp
system, which covers medical bills and pays lost wages, are immune from
personal-injury lawsuits. But employers who don't participate -- Texas
is the only state that doesn't require participation -- risk expensive
litigation if their workers are injured.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Labor advocates were outraged by recent decisions from the Seventh
Court of Appeals in Amarillo, which held that even if employers don't
participate in the workers' comp system, they can still require
employees to waive their rights to sue for damages related to
job-related injuries. If the high court upholds the Amarillo decisions,
workers' comp experts say it would undermine the primary incentive
companies have to join the comp system.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A high-court ruling on the workers' comp cases could jump-start the
issue at the Capitol, Mr. Glenn says, because business, labor and
insurers could use the ruling as the impetus for legislative debate.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
State Contracts
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
On Sept. 20, the high court will revisit the issue of suing the state
in contract disputes. The cases: General Services Commission vs.
Little-Tex Insulation Co. and Texas Department of Transportation vs.
Aer-Aerotron Inc.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The cases follow the high court's 1997 ruling that reiterated the
common-law doctrine that private citizens must get permission from the
Legislature before suing the state. Such permission is rarely granted.
But a footnote in that opinion stated that there might be "circumstances
where the state may waive its immunity by conduct."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Relying on that footnote, Austin's Third Court of Appeals allowed the
contractors' suits against the state to proceed; both had been dismissed
by the trial courts. The Third Court said the state waived its immunity
through its conduct, by accepting part of the contractors' goods and
services.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
One case involves a contract between Aer-Aerotron, an Orlando maker
of radio products, and the Transportation Department for $994,000 in
radios. After the state wanted to return some of the radios for a
refund, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court protection and
sued the state in Travis County District Court for breach of contract.
The other suit, also filed in the Travis County court, was brought by
Little-Tex Insulation Co. of San Antonio against the General Services
Commission over a contract for asbestos abatement in a state office
building.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Legislature in the last session passed a bill that set up a
process for alternative dispute-resolution to handle disagreements
between contractors and state agencies. But it decided not to tinker
with the state's immunity from lawsuits.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Product Defects
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Manufacturers are closely watching a case that could force them to
warn consumers about product defects that come to light only after the
products have been sold. Currently, they only have to warn of risks
known at the time products are sold.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In a series of decisions over the past few years, the state Supreme
Court has effectively reduced the responsibility of businesses and
individuals to prevent harm to others, giving plaintiffs a lot fewer
opportunities to sue. This case could mark a notable departure from that
trend.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The court heard arguments last January in Torrington Co. and
Ingersoll-Rand Corp. vs. Sharon Stutzman. The case involves a 1992
military-helicopter crash in Alabama. At issue is whether Torrington, a
subsidiary of Ingersoll-Rand Corp. of Woodcliff Lake, N.J., should have
warned the U.S. Navy about possibly defective bearings in the helicopter
that were made several years before the crash. The families of two
Marines who died in the crash won a $29 million judgment from a
Jefferson County court in 1996. Beaumont's Ninth Court of Appeals upheld
the verdict.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The families' attorney, Finis Cowan Jr. of Dickinson, says Torrington
discovered the defects when it investigated a separate helicopter crash
in 1991. By undertaking that investigation, he says, the firm assumed a
duty to warn users of the bearings.

Due Diligence: A $1.1 million price may seem steep -- but not in the
world of architectural landmarks. Frank Lloyd Wright designed this house
in a style he called "Usonian," which embodied his vision of a modern,
affordable American home. It's one of the final private homes he
designed, and was completed in 1959, the year he died at age 91. The
one-story brick house has a distinctive "Y" shape and walls of windows
that flood the long interior spaces with light. Inside, there's lots of
mahogany, including the kitchen cabinets and paneling in the bathrooms.
The 40-foot-long main living area has built-in banquette seating, and
each bedroom has built-in shelving and furniture. Throughout the house
are triangle light fixtures. Outside, owners David and Sheila Elston
created prairie landscaping -- as an homage to Wright's style and to
preserve indigenous plants. The Elstons never planned to leave, but Mr.
Elston accepted a job in another city. Local brokers say the asking
price is comparable to other Wright houses in the Chicago area.
Bannockburn has seen four home sales in the $1 million to $2 million
range.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
* The opening offer is Weekend Journal's estimate of a reasonable
starting point for negotiations to buy the property, based on past

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
MCLEAN, Va. -- Freddie Mac and mayors and community groups in 12
cities are launching a string of local campaigns to combat predatory
lending.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Freddie Mac, the nation's second-largest purchaser of home loans,
says it plans to dedicate about $500,000 in seed money to the campaigns,
which will include billboard advertisements, television public-service
announcements and hotlines that home buyers can call to report problems
or ask advice. Additional funding will come from local public and
private organizations.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The 12 cities are Chicago; Atlanta; Baltimore; New Orleans; Los
Angeles; Oakland, Calif.; Raleigh-Durham, N.C.; Washington; Cleveland;
Buffalo, N.Y.; Syracuse, N.Y.; and Las Vegas.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The newest campaigns are the latest in a series of efforts by Freddie
Mac to reduce predatory lending, which occurs when lenders charge
unfairly high interest rates or fees to home buyers with bad credit.
Previous steps include a ban on the purchase of mortgages with
single-premium credit insurance policies and requiring subprime lenders
to accurately and fully report borrower credit files to credit
repositories.

Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac Challenge
Big Banks' Powerful Lobby Group

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The battle between Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the big banks that hate
them is about to heat up again.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The two giant U.S.-based loan purchasers and their allies are
organizing an advocacy group known as the Homeownership Alliance,
designed in part to counter FM Watch, a high-profile lobbying group
formed last year by Chase Manhattan Corp., Wells Fargo &amp; Co., and others
that are worried about the possibility of Fannie and Freddie expanding
on to their turf. The group's message: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac -- and
the entire secondary mortgage market -- are critical to reducing housing
costs and making sure home loans are available.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Members of the coalition say they're afraid the mounting criticisms
could create support for broad changes in the way the secondary market
operates, driving up housing costs. "We're all interested in ensuring
that the match FM Watch lit does not set the entire housing finance
system aflame," says John Buckley, a spokesman for Fannie Mae.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Though the new group is still in its formative stages, it has hired
Rick Davis, the former national campaign manager of U.S. presidential
candidate John McCain, to head the effort. The group plans to put up a
Web site, organize seminars and symposiums, and fund and coordinate
research on housing issues. Mr. Davis declines to disclose how much
money the group has raised, although he says all members will
contribute.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
He says about a half-dozen banking, civil-rights and housing groups
in the U.S. have said they will sign on or have expressed interest in
doing so, including the Independent Community Bankers of America, the
National Association of Homebuilders, the National Urban League, and the
Enterprise Foundation, a community development group. Others include the
American League of Financial Institutions, a trade group for
minority-owned thrifts; the Local Initiatives Support Coalition, a
neighborhood redevelopment organization; and the National Association of
Real Estate Brokers.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The idea for the alliance emerged over the past several months, as
the criticisms intensified and Fannie Mae, with the encouragement of
Freddie Mac, the National Association of Homebuilders and others, began
organizing a new group to promote the current housing-finance system.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
According to an early draft of the group's Web site, the
Homeownership Alliance is dedicated to "exposing and defeating trends
that would harm consumer access to the lowest cost mortgage options." In
a section titled "Current Threats to the U.S. Homeownership System," the
group singles out FM Watch, calling it "a group of large, money-center
banks" and others who are "seeking to spread unfounded fears about risks
to the housing system."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Fannie and Freddie, which are publicly traded but operate under
government charters, help finance mortgage lending by buying home loans.
They either hold loans in portfolios as investments, or package them
into securities so they can be sold on Wall Street.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
They have come under intense pressure in recent months has from banks
and some politicians, and even drawn scrutiny from Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan. Some critics have questioned whether the
companies' rapid growth could someday pose a risk to taxpayers if the
agencies ever run into trouble, while competitors complain that the
agencies are using their advantages as government-sponsored entities to
expand unfairly. U.S. Rep. Richard Baker, a Louisiana Republican, has
introduced a bill that would limit the companies' growth and reorganize
their regulatory oversight.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mike House, the executive director of FM Watch, insists it is too
early to tell if his group will challenge the new alliance.

  READING THE REAL ESTATE INDEX
  LUXURY HOMES INDEX: shows price changes of an area's most expensive
houses. Actual prices vary greatly from city to city. The index shows,
however, that luxury homes are up 25% in Detroit; but up 37% in
Seattle. Put another way: A Washington, D.C., area home selling for $1
million in 1996 is, on average, worth $1,200,000 today; that year's
$500,000 Denver mansion is now worth $720,000.

U.S. Consumer Confidence
Rises on Strong Labor Market

Existing Home Sales Also Climb Unexpectedly

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
NEW YORK -- Robust labor-market conditions in the U.S. fueled a
rebound in consumer confidence in July, according to the Conference
Board, an independent business-research group.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Consumer confidence rose 2.5 points in July to 141.7, reversing about
half of June's decline. Consumer confidence is now three points below
its record.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A far more optimistic appraisal of current economic conditions --
especially labor markets -- pushed the measure of consumer confidence in
the present situation to 185.9 points, a record for that measure.
Indeed, the percentage of survey respondents claiming that jobs were
"hard to get" in July dropped to 9.9%, the lowest ever. The portion
saying jobs are "plentiful" rose to 55.1%, the highest level since
January. The gauge of expectations, or consumers' outlook six months
from now, nudged 0.3 point higher to 112.2.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"Consumer confidence readings continue to indicate a strong overall
economy," said Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board's Consumer
Research Center.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Economists are evaluating indicators such as consumer confidence and
spending in order to gauge whether the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise
interest rates when it meets next month.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Conference Board data suggest that while confidence is still at
buoyant levels, consumers are still pulling in the reins on big-ticket
spending, especially in interest-rate sensitive sectors like housing and
automobiles.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The percentage of survey respondents planning to buy an automobile
dropped to 6.8% in July, the lowest level since December 1997. Of all
respondents, 3.4% plan to purchase a home, the lowest level since April.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Separately, existing home sales in the U.S. rose unexpectedly for the
second consecutive month, also suggesting recent signs of an economic
slowdown may be premature.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The U.S. National Association of Realtors said sales of existing
homes in the U.S. rose 2.8% in June to a 5.23 million annual rate, the
highest level in 10 months. That is higher than the five million level
predicted on Wall Street.

Slowing Good News
To Home Buyers
</span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
If there's one good thing about the slowdown in construction, it's
that Florida home buyers are getting their homes a lot sooner.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
One of the hallmarks of the recent construction boom has been a
shortage of workers and supplies, which translated to delays in
completing new homes.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
George Glance, chief operating officer of American Heritage Homes USA
Inc. in Kissimmee, says delivery is back down to a more
customer-friendly four months, a reduction of about 60 days compared
with last fall. That's due in part to a general slowdown brought on by
higher interest rates and market pressures, he says. "Sales have begun
to slow, we're down about 15% in the first two quarters" compared with
last year, he says.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Nonetheless, American Heritage is launching a new 100-home
subdivision near Disney World, aimed largely at British and other
overseas vacation home buyers. Mr. Glance reasons overseas sales are
"somewhat insulated from the local market" and don't have the same
interest-rate pressures.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Still, construction is down across much of the state, according to
the Florida Construction Index, which measures residential construction.
The index fell 6.1% in June, compared with a year earlier. The biggest
drop was in Southwest Florida, which fell 10.6% from a year earlier. The
Northwest, the only region with an increase, was up 1.8%.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Is that a sign the Panhandle is returning to boom times? Not
necessarily, says Panama City builder Paul Sims, who caters to
rate-sensitive customers -- first-time home buyers and retirees. After
selling 21 homes in 1999, Mr. Sims has closed on only three so far this
year, and can't imagine selling more than 12 by year's end. "If things
have been slow, they're slower now," he says.

You've Got Sale
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Bob Pittman, America Online's president and chief operating officer,
just sold his house in Falls Village, Conn., for $679,000. Mr. Pittman,
the 46-year-old founder of MTV and one-time chief executive of Century
21, bought the house in 1985, before going to work for premerger Time
Warner Inc. The 30-acre estate, known as Birthday Hill Farm, was
originally listed a year and a half ago for just over $1 million. The
two-story, 7,800-square-foot  converted stone dairy barn has four
bedrooms and an indoor tennis court on the second floor. Outside, there
is a pool, a heated three-stall horse barn and a separate stone barn for
guests. Seymour Surnow  and Robert Arrowood of the Surnow Group at
William Raveis Real Estate in Washington, Conn., handled the sale. The
buyer is painter Vincent J. Inconiglios, who will live there with his
companion, Donna Raferty.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
No-Wynn Situation
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Steve Wynn, former chief executive of Mirage Resorts Inc., has
changed his mind about buying Barry Diller's Malibu, Calif., house,
people familiar with the deal say. Mr. Wynn, who had agreed this summer
to buy the home for $12.5 million, stayed there for several weeks, but
decided not to buy it after all, one person with knowledge of the talks
said. Local real-estate agents say Mr. Diller, the chairman and chief
executive of USA Networks Inc., should have no trouble finding another
buyer for the three-acre beachfront estate in singer Barbra Streisand's
neighborhood. Representatives for Mr. Diller declined to comment.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But Mr. Wynn's real-estate deals aren't done -- he is buying a
condominium on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue. It is the same apartment he
lived in while he was a Mirage executive, and the seller is MGM Mirage,
the company formed after MGM Grand Inc. acquired Mirage Resorts this
year. Mr. Wynn is paying $17.2 million for the furnished apartment and a
Gulfstream III jet. Mr. Wynn couldn't be reached for comment.

House Hopping in Connecticut
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Faith Stewart Gordon, former owner of New York's historic Russian Tea
Room, and literary agent Helen Brann just sold the 50-acre Roxbury,
Conn., estate they bought this year. They sold it for $2.4 million to
Alexander and Enid Fisher, according to public records. Ms. Gordon and
Ms. Brann paid $2.3 million for the five-bedroom, five-bath,
6,500-square-foot converted barn. They bought it from Broadway director
Richard Maltby Jr., whose credits include "Fosse" and "Ain't
Misbehavin'." The house has a three-car garage, a swimming pool and
neighbors such as actor Dustin Hoffman and composer Stephen Sondheim.
Klemm Real Estate, of Washington, Conn., handled both sales of the
house, and is also still showing Ms. Gordon's former home in the area,
which has an asking price of $1.475 million.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Meanwhile, the new owners of the Roxbury estate, the Fishers, also
sold a house in Litchfield County. Their 50-acre estate in Bridgewater,
Conn., on Lake Lillinonah, sold for $5.25 million, according to public
records -- the county's highest home price. The five-bedroom, six-bath
colonial has a pool, a tennis court and a guest house. The buyers are
listed as Charles and Theresa Delaney. Peter Klemm of Klemm Real Estate
handled that sale.

SBC to Give PCs to Internet Customers
---
Move Is Aimed at Boosting
Usage of DSL Lines;
2-Year Pact Is Required
  </span>
</div><div class="author">

  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
SBC Communications Inc. plans to give personal computers to customers
who sign a two-year contract for its high-speed Internet service, aiming
to boost usage of superfast digital subscriber line, or DSL, phone
lines.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
San Antonio-based SBC, which is deploying DSL throughout its region,
said it plans to charge consumers about $60 a month for the entire
package. That includes a new Compaq desktop computer preinstalled with a
DSL modem and SBC's Internet access service. Users also have to pay a
$198 shipping and handling charge for the computer. DSL is a technology
that uses jazzed-up copper telephone lines to transmit data, including
Internet connections, at speeds as much as 100 times as fast as
traditional dial-up services.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The promotion, a first for a Bell, is expected to be announced today.
It will be available through August to SBC customers in six states,
including California, Texas and Oklahoma. The company plans to expand
the promotion to other states later.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Bells and cable-TV companies are racing to sign up Internet
clients. Many have slashed prices and waived equipment and installation
fees to lure customers.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Most companies, including SBC, normally charge about $40 per month
for fast, always-on Internet links. Last week, Verizon Communications
Inc., the new name adopted by Bell Atlantic Corp., lowered its DSL price
to $40 a month from $50. A number of other companies offer almost-free
PCs if a customer signs up for Internet access or cashes in rebates.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Customers who sign up for the new SBC deal will receive a
566-megahertz Compaq Presario PC with an Intel Celeron processor, a
CD-ROM drive, a 10-gigabyte hard drive and unlimited Internet access.
The setup normally retails for about $1,000, said Dave Gallemore, SBC's
executive vice president of strategic marketing and planning.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mike Larson, a senior vice president at Compaq Computer Corp., said
the Houston company expects to sell "several hundred thousand" PCs to
SBC. Industry observers said SBC is probably paying about $600 for each
computer.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The marketing push is the latest in a series of aggressive steps by
SBC to sign up customers for DSL. Last week, SBC unveiled a DSL
self-installation kit. Today it plans to announce that it will charge
$150 -- an increase of $50 -- for home installations by SBC technicians
in areas where self-install kits are available.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
While SBC's latest promotion will likely attract more users, it is
primarily aimed at helping SBC overcome some installation glitches that
have plagued DSL rollout.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
SBC and others are struggling to keep up with demand for DSL as the
number of requests outpaces the technicians able to install the service
quickly. SBC says it is installing about 3,500 DSL lines a day. Each
installation can take several hours and sometimes requires multiple
visits to a customer's home. That can significantly drive up labor costs
for SBC. By going the self-install route, SBC is hoping to ease some of
that burden.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
As SBC and the other Bells continue to push hard on DSL, small
competitors are complaining that they are being pushed out altogether.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Indeed, DSL upstarts have long insisted that the Bells deliberately
try to slow them down. A few of these companies said that while
cooperation has improved, problems remain. "Everything that we need from
them is slow and painful," said Jeffrey Blumenfeld, general counsel for
Rhythms NetConnections Inc., Englewood, Colo.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Rivals said the Bells are slow to respond to requests for nearly
everything -- from customer-order processing to timely access to their
networks. Most DSL upstarts lease Bell lines and resell services under
their own names. They depend on the Bells for space inside their central
switching offices, where calls are routed and sorted, and to install
DSL-ready phone lines quickly. Under federal law, the Bells must treat
rivals equitably.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Even so, some DSL providers said the Bells just aren't concerned
about their business needs.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Rhythms and Covad Communications Group Inc., among others, said the
Bells install phone lines faster for their own customers than they do
for anybody else. "I think that in any judgment of where resources go,
they prefer their own," Mr. Blumenfeld said.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
On average, it takes the Bells five to 15 days to provide a DSL phone
line to Covad, said General Counsel Dhruv Khanna. That is down from 10
to 30 days a year earlier, he said, but still not as good as it should
be -- or as fast as the Bells provide lines for their own clients.
"Their performance has improved over time, but it's still not up to
snuff," Mr. Khanna said.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Customers who order DSL from smaller companies can be in for a long
wait -- installation can take weeks or even months. This sometimes leads
to finger-pointing between the Bells and their competitors, and
customers can get stuck in the middle.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Concentric Networks, an Internet service provider purchased by
NextLink Communications Inc., also has some complaints. In the
Northeast, served by Verizon, getting service "has been particularly
challenging," said Mark Fisher, senior vice president of marketing. Even
so, he said, things seem to be getting better, and Verizon has been
working with the company to resolve issues.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Covad and Rhythms said they expect cooperation to improve
significantly this fall, when a federal "line sharing" requirement goes
into effect. This change, instituted by the Federal Communications
Commission, will largely eliminate the need for technicians to
coordinate DSL work with the Bells.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Verizon acknowledged that there have been problems, but said its
relations with most competitors are good, and that the company is
complying with the law. A Verizon spokeswoman said most problems stem
from "miscommunication" with carriers. Things haven't been made any
easier, she said, by the difficult task of dealing with dozens of new
companies that lack resources and expertise to connect with Verizon's
network.

                  High-Speed Promotion
  SBC plans to include a Compaq Presario PC as part of a two-year
contract for its high speed digital subscriber line service.
  Current prices
  -- PC retail cost: About $1,000
  -- SBC's current DSL price: $40 per month
  SBC's new prices
  -- $60 a month for computer and DSL service; at SBC'S current DSL
prices, this means the consumer has paid $480 for the computer over 24
months
  Why
  -- Besides attracting more customers, the pre-equipped PCs mean SBC
won't have to visit the customer's house to install the DSL service
  -- Eliminates the labor costs associated with installment
  -- The time-consuming home visits have slowed SBC's attempt to
rollout its DSL service across its 13-state territory

  READING THE REAL ESTATE INDEX
  LUXURY HOMES INDEX: shows price changes of an area's most expensive
houses. Actual prices vary greatly from city to city. The index shows,
however, that luxury homes are up 29% in Detroit; but up 45% in
Seattle. Put another way: A Washington, D.C., area home selling for $1
million in 1996 is, on average, worth $1,250,000 today; that year's
$500,000 Denver mansion is now worth $775,000.
  MARKET SNAPSHOT: graphically highlights a metropolitan area and
indicates how all home values there have performed over five years
when compared to national prices and the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

Your Money Matters:
What? Bargain Houses?

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
It's hardly a crash, but home prices are softening in some markets.
June Fletcher goes house-hunting across the country and even finds a few
deals. Has the market finally peaked?
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
When Tom and Jenny Smith put their two-bedroom home in Palo Alto,
Calif., on the market a few weeks ago for a whopping $1.55 million, they
expected it would be snatched up in days. After all, it's a beautifully
landscaped bungalow in the heart of Silicon Valley, where outrageous
bidding wars have been the norm for more than a year -- and houses
selling in the $1 million range are often deemed "fixer uppers" or even
"tear downs."
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But now the couple is considering the unthinkable -- lowering their
price. "The fever seems to have died," Mr. Smith, a computer consultant,
says. "Buyers aren't overconfident anymore."
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Have we peaked yet? Nationally, home prices are still rising and
still outpacing inflation. But after nearly a decade of upward momentum,
housing prices in selected areas seem to have lost a bit of their
irrational exuberance. In wealthy places, such as parts of Seattle, New
York and Silicon Valley, this spring's stock market jitters have put the
brakes on runaway price appreciation. In other, less affluent spots,
interest rate run-ups have priced some home buyers out of the market.
And in fast-growing sectors of cities such as San Diego and Washington,
D.C., there are now more homes on the market, helping curb price growth.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
We went looking around the country for areas that are now seeing
falling prices or where prices are showing signs of peaking or even
passing their peak. What we found was some cooling even in places where
the market is still sizzling. While loft prices in the trendy SoHo
neighborhood of Manhattan rose an annualized 42% in the first quarter of
this year, for example, local real-estate brokers report a slight
downturn in neighboring TriBeCa: Open-house traffic is off by half and
bidding wars are starting to abate. In other areas, such as Boulder,
Colo., and parts of Houston, sellers are offering modest but until
recently unheard of incentives, from free appliances to help with
financing.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Seattle situation is similarly mixed. Median prices rose 8.3% to
$226,100 for the first quarter, compared with a year ago. But
real-estate brokers say much of the growth is being driven by the city's
traffic problems. Places in town or near high-tech centers east of the
city are in such demand that desperate buyers go as far as writing
letters praising the seller's housekeeping, or enclosing pictures of
their kids to try to clinch a deal, broker and appraiser Ed Murphy says.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But further out in Snohomish County, north of the city, the sellers
are the ones getting desperate. Brian and Sharon Ward have been trying
to sell their eight-year-old custom-built home for more than two years,
lowering their initial $799,000 asking price to $779,900. Although the
lakefront home has four marble fireplaces, a seven-foot Italian crystal
chandelier and a mahogany deck, buyers have shown little interest. "On
the East side, people are paying $1.5 million for tear-downs," says Mr.
Ward, who owns a heating-and-air-conditioning company. "I can't even get
people out to see this property."
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
To be sure, home sales typically taper off in the summer. But
real-estate agents say some of what's happening this year hasn't been
seen since the real-estate slowdown of the early '90s and can't simply
be called a summer slump.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In Houston, for example, Paul and Julie Musser just snagged a
four-bedroom white colonial in upper-middle-class Jersey Village. They
got the house, which has a pool and gazebo, for $254,000 -- about
$10,000 less than the asking price -- and got $1,000 at closing to spend
on remodeling. That's hardly a steal, of course, but it's a far cry from
the frenzy of recent years.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"We feel like we were at the right place at the right time," says
Mrs. Musser, who closed on the house last month. Overall, median prices
in Houston rose a respectable 7.5% to $105,800 for the first quarter,
but prices have recently weakened in upscale areas such as Jersey
Village, where plenty of homes are for sale.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Indeed, the National Association of Realtors' recent survey of 128
major metropolitan areas showed that in the first quarter, median home
prices fell in 37 cities -- including South Bend, Ind., Shreveport, La.,
and Portland, Maine -- compared with a year earlier. Only 21 cities --
among them, Omaha, Neb., Baltimore and San Diego -- showed the
double-digit increases. By contrast, in the first quarter of 1998, 23
cities showed double-digit jumps, while median prices fell in only five
cities. "It's starting to seep into the public consciousness that things
are slowing down," says Fred Flick, the trade group's vice president of
economic research. "Buyers are becoming more cautious."
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Karl Case, an economist with a Cambridge, Mass., research firm that
compiles quarterly home-price statistics, adds that, while home prices
overall are likely to keep going up, many areas are nearing or past
their peak. He says the number of second-quarter sales of new and
existing homes has declined, a sign the economy may be slowing despite
continued strength in job growth. "People have been buying on the
expectation that the economy doesn't have to go down, but you can't
repeal the business cycle," he says. "I think people ought to worry."
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In some places, they already do. In Biloxi, Miss., for instance,
median home prices plummeted 25.4% for the first quarter, to $65,500 --
the worst drop in the country, according to the National Association of
Realtors. Local broker Ray Jones blames the increase in interest rates
this spring. Although mortgage rates have gone down, they are still
around 8%, about 1.5 percentage points higher than they were 21 months
ago. "We have very few buyers here who can afford to pay cash for homes,
so when rates went up, people simply quit buying," he says.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In wealthier regions, such as the San Francisco Bay area, supply is
driving prices. The city has had a chronic shortage of homes for sale,
which has pushed prices up relentlessly -- during the first quarter
alone, they rose a blistering 25% from a year earlier, to $418,600, the
highest increase in the nation. But now increased competition is forcing
sellers to curb some of their more outlandish demands.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the hot $5 million-and-up range, real-estate agent Carol MacCorkle
says, sellers are no longer insisting buyers accept their homes "as is,"
even if there is a major problem such as termite damage. That is a big
change from January, when hardly any homes in that range were available
in Silicon Valley, and buyers were sweetening deals by paying in cash or
offering to close in as few as five days.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Today, market jitters are taking a toll. "We're Nasdaq-sensitive,"
says Ms. MacCorkle, who has seen fewer bidding wars since the spring.
Appreciation is slowing down a bit too: In wealthy Atherton, Calif.,
prices rose 40% in the first quarter, she says, but now are rising at a
pace of about 25% to 30%. That's because there are now five times as
many upper-end homes on the market than there were in January, when only
six homes were listed.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In more stable markets, there are also indications that things may be
getting a little better for buyers. About a month ago, Stu and Julie
Damon sold their colonial home in a chic Washington, D.C., suburb for
$538,000 -- $13,000 more than their asking price -- in a bidding war
that erupted almost immediately after they listed it. So when they
started looking in an equally fashionable neighborhood in Richmond, Va.,
about 60 miles away, they figured they would have to fight to get the
home they wanted.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Not so. In less than a month, the market had settled just enough so
that they paid only the asking price -- $525,000 -- for their home, and
they got the seller to shell out $2,500 in repairs. "I think we sold at
the peak," Mrs. Damon. "Now prices seem like they're beginning to
soften."
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
When area prices soften, builders are loath to lower home prices in
communities they have already started work on, because they don't want
to anger buyers who purchased early. Instead, they offer incentives to
buy, such as free sunrooms or finished basements, or help with closing
costs. Although it is still too early for builders to give away such
expensive goodies, some are starting to offer modest lures to skittish
buyers -- even in such hot markets as Denver, where median prices rose
nearly 13% during the first quarter from the year-earlier period.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Denver marketing consultant Robert August, who represents 50 local
builders, says that in the past few weeks, some of his clients have
become so nervous about the economy that they are giving away free
appliances, offering to help pay mortgage points, and reducing
commissions for on-site sales agents. Buyers, for their part, are
becoming more demanding. Mr. August says one of his clients recently got
a contract where the buyer wanted full landscaping, free air
conditioning and a gas grill. "Six months ago, no one would have dared
to ask for that."
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Oddly enough, second homes seem to be impervious to any weakening in
home prices. Rick Moeser, who heads the Southern regional office for
Sotheby's International Realty, says there has been "no slippage at all
in prices" for his high-end division, in which sales average $1.7
million. In fact, young Wall Street turks paying more than $1 million
for two-bedroom Manhattan condominiums tend to view similarly priced
Southeastern oceanfront estates in resort areas as bargains, he says.
"People are paying the asking price, no questions asked."
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In Southampton, N.Y., another summer mecca for Manhattanites,
real-estate broker Jack Hangen says prices have risen at a rate of about
20% for the past year and a half and show no signs of backsliding. He
thinks the reason prices haven't fallen off -- even amid a wobbly stock
market -- is that the East Coast financiers who are snapping up the
properties aren't arrivistes relying on "dot-com money."
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"We're seeing people who struck it rich a decade ago when they were
in their 30s," Mr. Hangen says. "Now they're in their 40s and have
families; they've become more conservative in their investments. And
they're buying these vacation houses with their bonuses."
  </p>

                     City Snapshots
When it comes to home prices, national statistics tell only part of the
story -- and even hot areas have their weak spots. Below, a look at
prices in certain cities:
  Major Markets -- Denver
  What's Happening -- Entry-level homes in suburbs such as Aurora and
Parker are appreciating, but prices are flat in upper- end areas,
including Boulder. To boost sales, builders are offering incentives
and beefing up advertising.
  Examples -- Buyers of a $350,000 new home in Superior, Colo., get a
free upgraded kitchen appliance package worth about $7,000.
  Comments -- "We're coming out of a period where builders have been
order takers," Denver consultant Mark Samuelson says. "They're not
used to having inventory."
  Major Markets -- Nashville, Tenn.
  What's Happening -- Prices are still rising for homes in the middle
of the market -- from about $150,000 to $500,000 -- but brokers say
upper-end prices have leveled off.
  Examples -- A Green Hills area home went under contract for $314,000
-- $21,000 less than the asking price -- after 70 days on the market.
  Comments -- "Things aren't flying off the shelves anymore," Nashville
broker Bill Bainbridge says.
  Major Markets -- New York
  What's Happening -- Overall prices are still rising rapidly, but some
areas are hotter than others. In the first quarter, SoHo loft prices
rose 42%, while TriBeCa prices slagged a bit.
  Examples -- Last month, the town house (above) sold for the $2.3
million asking price. Local brokers say it would have sold for more
than the asking price six months ago.
  Comments -- "Buyers feel they've been chasing a runaway train, and if
they wait, prices will be better," New York broker Barbara Corcoran
says.
  Major Markets -- Phoenix
  What's Happening -- Even in ritzy Paradise Valley, prices are now
appreciating at an annual rate of less than 1%; in the first quarter,
they were rising at an annualized 10% rate.
  Examples -- Six months ago, lower-priced homes in expensive
neighborhoods sold in days. But the $1.95 million home (above) has
been on the market for more than a month.
  Comments -- "Buyers are becoming more cautious because of the
diminished value of their stock portfolios," says Paradise Valley
broker Greg Hague.
  Major Markets -- San Diego
  What's Happening -- Prices rose nearly 21% in May over the same month
a year ago, but there are signs of softening. Brokers say some sellers
are no longer getting their asking prices.
  Examples -- Although it has only two bedrooms and a tiny lot, brokers
say the oceanfront home pictured above is well priced at $759,000.
  Comments -- "Prices have reached the top," San Diego economist Gary
London says. "But I see clouds ahead."
  Resort Markets -- Aspen, Colo.
  What's Happening -- Inventory is low in all price ranges, so sellers
are pricing aggressively. Still, there are few bidding wars and homes
are selling at the asking price or a little lower.
  Examples -- The three-bedroom property (above), sold "as is," is
under contract for near its $1.9 million asking price. It spent 45
days on the market -- a quick sale by local standards.
  Comments -- "When the stock market starts bumping, we do better than
when it's on the upswing," Aspen real-estate agent Charley Podolak
says.
  Resort Markets -- Jackson, Wyo.
  What's Happening -- Expensive homes with a view of the Grand Tetons
are appreciating rapidly; those priced at less than $1 million aren't.
Many homes sell at or near their asking prices, but some linger on the
market for months.
  Examples -- A $5.5 million cedar-sided home on 6.7 acres has been on
the market for more than 14 months.
  Comments -- "Prices here aren't much affected by the stock market,
since many of our buyers are wealthy retirees," Jackson Hole broker
Ken Gangwer says.

desirable properties in a selection of popular vacation and

locations were selected for their popularity among various types of
vacationers and second-home owners, for their proximity to major
metropolitan areas and for geographic diversity.
  MARKET SNAPSHOT: graphically highlights a metropolitan area and
indicates how all home values there have performed over five years
when compared to national prices and the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
