</div><div class="author">By Rex Nutting   </div><div>408 words</div><div>29 April 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The share of homes vacant and for sale, an important measure of the nation's housing supply, set a record in the first quarter in a signal that the glut of homes on the market isn't improving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The homeowner vacancy rate, which measures the number of vacant homes for sale, rose to a record 2.9% in the first quarter from 2.8% in the fourth quarter, about one percentage point higher than normal, according to new Census Bureau data. The vacancy rate has jumped nationwide and in cities, suburbs and rural areas since the housing bubble popped. From 1995 until the fourth quarter of 2005, the rate held between 1.5% and 2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 2.2 million vacant homes were for sale in the first quarter, up from 2.1 million in the fourth quarter and about one million more than was typical before the housing bubble burst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say the rising vacancies indicate that home prices won't stop falling and home builders can't ramp up construction until the glut of vacancies can be worked down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's the worst piece of housing news that we've heard in the past couple of months," said Patrick Newport, U.S. economist at Global Insight. "It means home prices will continue to drop at least for the remainder of the year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Census Bureau also reported that families are no more likely to own their home now than they were in 2002, even with the big effort to push families with poor credit into homeownership through subprime mortgages. The seasonally adjusted share of homes occupied by owners rose to 67.9% from 67.7% in the fourth quarter after peaking at 69.3% in 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Given tight lending standards and foreclosures, we expect the homeownership rate will continue to edge lower," wrote Michele Meyer, an economist at <span class="companylink">Lehman Bros.</span></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, a record 4.1 million vacant homes are for rent, with the rental vacancy rate rising to 10.1% in the first quarter. The rental vacancy rate wasn't statistically different from the first quarter of 2007 but exceeded the fourth quarter's 9.6%. The record number of vacant rentals should keep rents from rising too fast, which might be a major factor in moderating inflation during the next year or two.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bleak report on housing Thursday and mixed data on big-ticket orders suggest the U.S. economy is in for a prolonged slowdown, even if it manages to escape an outright contraction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That should keep the U.S. Federal Reserve on track to lower interest rates when it meets next week. Most analysts expect the Fed to cut its benchmark federal-funds rate by a quarter-percentage point to 2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new, single-family homes slumped an unexpectedly sharp 8.5% in March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 526,000, the lowest level since October 1991, the Commerce Department said. Sales were down 36.6% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bottom of the market doesn't appear in sight, given the supply of homes for sale soared to 11 months, the highest in almost three decades. The average and median price for a new home each fell at double-digit rates from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Northeast was hit particularly hard, with sales down almost 65% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the sales data are subject to monthly volatility, "this is just gruesome and leaves no other conclusion than that the downturn in the U.S. housing market is still in full swing," said ING Bank economist Dimitry Fleming in a research note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is likely to weigh on housing starts, keeping downward pressure on employment in the construction industry and housing-related consumer spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet even if housing remains a drag, hopes were lifted that other sectors of the economy like business investment will withstand the downturn. Orders for durable goods fell just slightly, by 0.3%, last month, the Commerce Department said, after falling 0.9% in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline was triggered by weakness in transportation, particularly automobiles, and defense-related orders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some parts of the report -- particularly gains in orders excluding transportation and defense -- suggested resilience. A 1.2% increase in shipments for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft -- the component of the durable-goods report that is used in gross domestic product calculations -- and rising inventories signaled that the economy probably managed to expand, albeit just barely, in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> economist Drew Matus raised his first-quarter GDP-growth estimate by 0.4 percentage point to 0.7% following release of the durable-goods data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economic slowdown "may not be as severe as we feared, but it's probably not going to be as short as we had hoped," said Michael Feroli, economist at <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase.</span></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Labor Department said initial jobless claims tumbled by 33,000 to 342,000 last week. Continuing claims lasting longer than one week also fell. ---</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty  </div><div>1197 words</div><div>24 April 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And now for the heartwarming side of the housing bust: It's helping some people buy homes that they couldn't afford a couple of years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michelle Dudley for years commuted 50 miles each way to her job as a civil servant in Anaheim, Calif., because she and her husband, Don, didn't feel they could afford a home near her office. This week, though, the Dudleys moved into a three-bedroom house in Anaheim that they recently bought for $390,000, down from the original listing price of $445,000 in November. Similar homes in the area were selling for as much as about $600,000 two years ago, says Erin Eckert, an agent for Redfin, an online real-estate brokerage that represented the Dudleys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, many potential buyers are holding out for better deals. The Wall Street Journal's quarterly survey of housing-market conditions in 28 major metro areas points to continued downward pressure on prices in much of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As usual, there is huge variation from town to town. In most of the country, inventories of unsold homes are no longer growing quickly, as they did in 2006 and 2007, but remain huge. The supply has shrunk modestly in Boston and Denver over the past year. But the number of for-sale signs continues to rise swiftly in the Portland, Ore.; Seattle; Raleigh-Durham, N.C.; San Francisco; and Washington areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest gluts are in Florida. In the Miami-Fort Lauderdale area, the supply of single-family homes and condominiums is enough to last 34 months at the average sales rate of the past year. That months-supply figure is about 21 in Orlando, 18 in Tampa and Las Vegas, 17 in Detroit and 14 in Phoenix. A six-month inventory is generally considered a rough balance between supply and demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For condos alone in Miami-Dade County, the supply would last 45 months at the current sales rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices are coming down fast. Real-estate data company Zillow.com estimates that the median value for all homes in the 12 months ended March 31 fell 25% in the Las Vegas metro area, 19% in Miami and Orlando, and 16% in Phoenix. The typical value is still rising modestly in a few places, including the metro areas of Raleigh and Charlotte, N.C., Dallas and Houston. One hitch for house hunters, though, is that mortgage lenders have become much more restrictive with loans. And even buyers who can get financing still face a tricky question: Should I wait for a lower price? Buying now, with home prices generally falling, is "a gamble," says Ms. Dudley, who just moved into her new Anaheim home. But, she says, home prices will rise again at some point. Meanwhile, she was tired of her long, expensive commute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kevin McCleary, a computer-security consultant, remained a renter through the housing boom even though he could afford to buy, because he believed prices were reaching unsustainable levels. In October, though, he and his fiancee finally decided to buy a foreclosed home in Herndon, Va., and negotiated a price of about $443,000. The same home sold in 2005 for $645,000. "I don't believe we hit it at the perfect time," Mr. McCleary says. On the other hand, he says, "we were just tired of putting our lives on hold."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the boom, home prices rose far faster than incomes. Home prices as measured by the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller national index shot up 74% in the six years through 2006, while median household income rose 15%. (Neither figure is adjusted for inflation.) Now prices in many areas are adjusting back toward more affordable levels, a process that could take several years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an analysis of 330 metro areas in last year's fourth quarter, <span class="companylink">National City Corp.</span>, a banking concern, and Global Insight, an economic research firm, found that home prices were sharply overvalued in relation to household income and other factors in 21 metro areas, down from a peak of 58 metro areas in the second quarter of 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists at the two firms look at home prices in relation to household income and other variables, including population density (an indication of how much land is available) and past differences in prices caused by factors like climate and schools. They then classify as "overvalued" metro areas where home prices are more than 33% above a level that could be explained by fundamental drivers of housing costs. Among areas where this analysis finds that home prices are still too high are Bend, Ore., Atlantic City, N.J., Miami, Honolulu and Portland, Ore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In most of the country, "we're getting a return to normalcy" in the relation between home prices and incomes, says Richard DeKaser, chief economist at National City. But, he adds, prices may overshoot on the down side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists at <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> say home prices are likely to level off by late 2009. They also point to improving affordability. Goldman's chief U.S. economist, Jan Hatzius, says the share of a typical family's income needed to pay mortgage payments on a median-priced home averaged about 17.5% from 1993 to 2003, before jumping to 26% in 2006. The figure now has fallen to 20% and is likely to keep declining as home prices fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hatzius estimates that average U.S. home prices have fallen 15% since the second quarter of 2006 and projects they will fall an additional 10% before stabilizing late next year. But he also sees a risk that home prices will fall further, particularly if the foreclosure problem proves worse than already expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Goldman estimates that foreclosures will add 1 million to 1.5 million homes to the for-sale market this year, compared with less than half a million a year before 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the first quarter, homes acquired by lenders through foreclosure accounted for 33% of all sales of previously occupied homes in California, up from just 3.2% a year earlier, according to <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> Information Systems, a research firm in La Jolla, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners hoping to avoid a foreclosure are adding to downward pressure on the market, says Daniel R. Odio, owner of DROdio Real Estate Inc. in Alexandria, Va. Such people often seek to unload their homes through a "short sale," in which the price is less than the amount owed on the mortgage and the lender agrees to forgive the difference. Homeowners hoping to do a short sale sometimes advertise very low asking prices to lure buyers, even if there is little chance the lender would accept bids at that level, Mr. Odio says. The "fictional" asking price, in turn, misleads potential buyers about the value of nearby homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of lower-priced homes has surged in some areas. Steven Thomas, president of Re/Max Real Estate Services in Aliso Viejo, Calif., says there are about 1,260 condos available for under $250,000 in Orange County, Calif., or about triple the year-earlier total.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. sales of previously owned homes declined in March as the housing-market slump continued, but two gauges of home prices provided a glimmer of hope that the slump might be easing a bit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales in the U.S. fell 2% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.93 million, the National Association of Realtors said.The drop followed an increase of 2.9% in February, the first monthly gain since July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The languid pace of sales pushed inventories of unsold homes to a 9.9 months' supply at current sales rates. That large overhang has put downward pressure on prices for months, especially in areas hit hardest by the housing crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, however, there are signs that prices might be starting to stabilize. The median U.S. home price rose to $200,700 last month from a revised $195,600 in February, the realtors' report said. And the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight's home-price index showed prices rising a seasonally adjusted 0.6% in February from January, the first monthly gain since June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both measures have their limitations. The realtors' data reflect a changing mix of homes, rather than tracking the same houses being bought and sold. The Ofheo index tracks homes purchased with government-backed mortgages, which excludes homes purchased with substandard loans more susceptible to the housing market's swoon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the data suggest declines in sales and prices may be slowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While it remains too early to definitively call a bottom, we continue to argue that home sales will stabilize (albeit at very low levels) by midyear," said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales dropped 6.5% in the Midwest last month and 3.5% in the South; they rose 2.2% in the West and Northeast. Single-family home sales fell 2.7%, while sales of condominiums and co-ops rose 3.6%, for a second consecutive increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fate of the nation's housing market could determine the shape and length of the current economic downturn. In an interview, Richard Fisher, president of the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas</span>, warned that the U.S. may be in for a long period of "anemic growth -- longer than two quarters."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, Mr. Fisher said, "I don't think it needs to be all that deep. We've really weathered a hell of a setback.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This strikes deep at the heart of the ordinary, hard-working consumer," he said. "They're getting multiple whammies -- slow economic growth, job insecurity, their homes are perceived to be worth less. And they're paying more at the pump and more for food. So the consumer is really getting hammered. And yet they've held up fairly well so far."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also said that slower economic growth may not resolve mounting concerns about inflation because he expects only a mild slowdown in world demand. "We've been weakening and we haven't seen the price responses," he said. Mr. Fisher voted against lowering interest rates at the last two meetings of the Federal Reserve's policy committee.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home Data</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">May Inspire</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">False Hope</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing news has been so grim for so long that investors seize on any data that is less than disastrous as a sign of a recovery right around the corner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is a risky bet based more on wishful thinking than common sense. With the economy teetering on recession, credit tight and the labor market weakening, odds are that housing will keep getting worse before it starts to get better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday's National Association of Realtors' report on existing-home sales in March will test investor thirst for good news. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones forecast that March sales will drop 2% from the previous month. If the report is better than that, expect to hear talk about more lights flashing at the end of the tunnel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists also were expecting a drop in February. Instead, sales rose to a 5.04 million annual rate, a surprising 2.9% increase from January, the first uptick since July. Investors celebrated. NAR economist Lawrence Yun said the report is a sign housing is "stabilizing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors looked past some unsettling data in the February report. While sales were up slightly from January, they were still 24% below a year earlier. More troubling, the median home price hit $195,000, down 8.2% from the previous year, the biggest drop on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't expect to see a meaningful pickup in sales until prices stop falling. Few buyers are going to leap into a new house if they fear its price will drop. Declining prices are a primary reason why economists at Global Insight don't expect existing-home sales to reach bottom until the third quarter, hitting an annual rate of 4.35 million, a 13% decline from February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The labor market is weakening, credit markets are very tight and home prices are dropping at an accelerating rate," Global Insight economist Patrick Newport says. "Put those three together, and it doesn't look like a good time for sales to bottom out."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Sherwin-Williams</span>:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Glossy or Flat?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One company's fortunes are closely tied to the fate of existing-home sales: paint maker <span class="companylink">Sherwin-Williams</span>, which benefits when owners spruce up houses for resale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Cleveland-based maker of <span class="companylink">Dutch Boy</span> and Krylon paints is due to report second-quarter earnings Tuesday. It warned March 24 that the results wouldn't be pretty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remodeling, the biggest driver of house-paint demand, has slowed as home prices have cratered, drying up the equity homeowners usually tap for such projects. This activity should stay sluggish as long as credit stays tight. And recently, commercial and industrial paint demand also has softened and could get worse if the economy is in recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meantime, high input costs are eroding <span class="companylink">Sherwin-Williams</span>'s bottom line. <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>, in a research note Monday, estimated that oil-based raw materials such as resins and solvents make up at least 65% of the total cost of a can of paint.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Sherwin-Williams</span>, already has raised prices. Contractors make up the majority of its customers, and they are more willing than do-it-yourselfers to accept price increases. But it could take a full year for the company's profit margins to recover, Goldman analysts estimate.</p>

</div><div class="author">By June Fletcher   </div><div>1021 words</div><div>18 April 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>W10</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second-home market is in a slump. But one type of vacation property is still showing signs of life: condos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new National Association of Realtors study estimates that sales of vacation homes in 2007 fell 31%, to 740,000, from 2006. But sales of condos dipped only slightly -- down 2.8% -- while sales of detached homes dropped 38%. The upshot is that condos cornered a substantially larger share of the vacation-home market last year: 29%, up from 21% in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condos are selling better than single-family vacation houses for a number of reasons. They don't require their owners to maintain lawns, trim shrubs, paint the exteriors or replace roofs -- increasingly important concerns to an aging population. Condo communities also tend to offer amenities such as pools and clubhouses. And condos usually are cheaper to buy, and easier to resell, than houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the prices of vacation condos haven't held up. Median prices fell almost 10% to $180,000 last year from the year before, while prices of single-family second homes remained flat, says the Realtor group. Part of that decline reflects the general downturn in the housing market, but the price pressure on condos also comes from investors who bought units in resort markets during the real-estate boom and now are trying to get rid of them. While the price-cutting is bad news for existing condo owners, it can make the units seem like relative bargains to buyers compared to houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tod Phelps and his wife, Shelly, are among the second-home buyers attracted to condos. The couple since 2001 have owned a three-bedroom house on Beech Mountain, N.C., a 2 1/2-hour drive from their primary home in Greensboro, N.C. But Mr. Phelps, an information-technology executive, says he is tired of spending weekends cleaning gutters and painting doors, and paying at least $3,000 a year to have people mow the lawn, weed flowerbeds and plow the drive in winter. "I didn't expect it to be as much trouble as it was," he says. Now the couple plan to sell the house and replace it with a "ski-in, ski-out" condo in the same community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condos are also making inroads in vacation spots where they've rarely been seen before, including beach villages along Lake Michigan. Some of these are attracting a new type of buyer used to an urban environment. Mary Morrissey, a government policy consultant in Chicago, and her husband recently bought a $350,000, two-bedroom loft at the Vineyards, a converted winery in Harbert, Mich. It features such downtown design elements as concrete fireplaces and window seats, exposed ductwork and soaring ceilings. The unit is much more open, light and fun than the usual cramped cottages found in the area, Ms. Morrissey says, and the contemporary style was the main reason they were attracted to it. "We never even thought about buying a single-family home," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in some places, such as Hawaii, prices have risen so high in recent years that condos are the only viable choice for many buyers. Maui broker Georgina Hunter says $1 million buys a two-bedroom condo in a resort with golf, pool and fitness center, but isn't enough for a single-family home. Since acquisition costs are so high, many buyers look to rent out their places when they're not vacationing there. Here condos also have the edge: Local zoning allows most condos to be rented for a short period, while most houses must be rented for at least 180 days. "You just get more bang for your buck," Ms. Hunter says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But condos aren't popular in every second-home area. In New York's Hamptons, people prefer detached houses because they offer a yard, extra rooms and privacy -- "exactly what New Yorkers often lack in their primary residences," says Rick Hoffman, East End Regional vice president for <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span> brokers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condo living also can require an attitude adjustment as owners contend with close-by neighbors and live under a condo association's rules. Wayne Zawila, an Orlando, Fla., futures trader, paid $619,000 a little over a year ago for a three-bedroom weekend getaway in Daytona Beach, Fla. He thought the fourth-floor condo would be more secure and easier to manage than the Galena, Ill., lakefront house he used to own, which he once drove to at 3 a.m. because he was worried the pipes had frozen. But though condo life can be more carefree, at least when it comes to security and exterior maintenance, it's not rules-free. Mr. Zawila sometimes chafes under communal regulations he's never had to deal with before, like the one that bans him from smoking cigars while lounging in the pool. "It drives me nuts," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because many affluent second-home buyers like the common ownership and upkeep of exterior elements but still want a detached house, some builders are combining them in "condo homes." That setup attracted Sue Anne Davidson-Kalkus, a retired antiques dealer in Rome, Ga., and her husband, Tony, a retired Army colonel, who were married last year. A few months ago they listed her four-bedroom vacation retreat on 10 acres on Lookout Mountain, Ga., for $1 million and started searching for an easy-care vacation condo in the $600,000 range in New England, nearer to Mr. Kalkus's grown children. But after owning a custom-built place, Mrs. Davidson-Kalkus found the apartment-style condos she looked at to be "very ordinary." So the couple has just inked a deal to buy a detached, two-bedroom condo home at Winnapaug Cottages, a 35-acre development in Westerly, R.I. Their $300-a-month homeowner's fee covers landscaping, garbage collection, snow removal and exterior maintenance. "This is the best of both worlds," she says.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sudeep Reddy   </div><div>683 words</div><div>17 April 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sharp housing downturn is causing the economy to stall across much of the nation, suggesting that inflation will remain moderate despite surging food and energy costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government said housing starts plunged 11.9% last month to the lowest level since around the time of the 1990-91 recession. Meanwhile, industrial output rose 0.3% -- but the manufacturing component ticked up only slightly as companies continued to struggle with lower demand for housing-related products. Consumer prices rose 0.3% in March after being unchanged in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing sector's sharp decline "will be a major drag" on the economy throughout this year and into 2009, Janet Yellen, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said in a speech.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers, while grappling with a credit crunch and falling house prices, also are burdened by a weakening labor market, a declining stock market and sharply higher food and energy prices, Ms. Yellen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It appears that growth in consumption and business-investment spending has slowed markedly after years of robust performance and, as a result, the economy has all but stalled and could even contract over the first half of the year," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve, to spur the economy, is expected to lower interest rates again at its April 29-30 meeting. Fed officials may decide to cut the central bank's benchmark federal-funds rate by a quarter percentage point to 2% after a series of large reductions designed to soften the blow from the credit crunch and financial crisis. By the end of Wednesday, futures markets put the chance of a half-point cut at 24%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said March housing starts fell to an annual rate of 947,000, down 36.5% from a year earlier. The last time housing starts fell below the one-million mark was in May 1991, just after the end of a recession. Building permits for new homes fell 5.8% to 927,000, a sign of more construction declines to come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts say the steep declines may be setting the stage for an eventual turnaround. For housing to exit from its deep slump, housing starts -- which peaked in January 2006 at 2.3 million -- must drop to a point low enough where sales of new homes can eat away at the record numbers of unsold houses on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York University economist Nouriel Roubini expects housing starts to drop to at least 700,000 before hitting bottom, with home prices falling through at least 2009. "We're still in the first few innings" of a recession, said the chairman of research firm Roubini Global Economics. "The next 12 to 18 months are going to be painful."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 0.3% rise in industrial production, the Fed said, reflected gains in output by utilities and producers of electronics. Manufacturing output rose only 0.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed, in its "beige book" summarizing regional economic conditions, said consumer spending was softening across most of the country with "ongoing weakness in housing markets" in almost all areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Businesses expressed particular concern about higher costs for raw materials. "Most manufacturers have or are planning to increase prices in response to rising input costs," the Fed said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A slowing economy is expected to keep inflation at moderate levels as consumer demand declines. The weakening labor market also should ease pressure on employers to raise wages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department said consumer prices excluding food and energy prices rose 0.2% last month. From a year earlier, prices in March were up 4% and up 2.4% excluding food and energy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil closed Wednesday at a record $114.93 a barrel, up $1.14, adding to inflation concerns and threatening to sap consumer spending even further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Yellen and many other Fed officials believe price pressures will moderate in coming years. "The weakening in economic activity should put somewhat greater downward pressure on inflation going forward," she said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I take great exception to the premise of your editorial ("Beltway Fun House," April 8) that the housing stimulus legislation the Senate is considering, and the $7,000 tax credit in particular, won't do much for the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experience is a great teacher. In the mid-1970s, America faced a similar housing crisis when a period of easy credit and loose underwriting flooded the market with new construction. Interest rates rose, the economy slowed and America was left with a three-year supply of vacant homes. Congress responded by passing a $2,000 tax credit for anyone purchasing a new home for their principal residence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I spent more than three decades in the real estate business, and I saw the positive effects of the 1975 tax credit firsthand. The results were clear and swift as buyers came back into the market, home values stabilized, housing inventory dropped and the market recovered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the fourth quarter of 2007 alone, 642,150 foreclosure filings were reported. Many of these properties are already vacant and becoming a magnet for crime and pushing down property values in neighborhoods across this nation. I submit this is doing more damage to the average homeowner who pays his bills on time than any tax credit. The sooner we can take down those foreclosure signs, the sooner all homebuyers will benefit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $7,000 tax credit is an incentive for the market to respond. It will inspire qualified buyers to get off the sidelines and enter the market. It will allow us to replace loan defaults with good mortgages, helping to stabilize housing prices for all homeowners. The tax credit for homebuyers worked in 1975 and it will work again today.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small-business owners' confidence in the economy is plummeting, prompting cutbacks in hiring and expansion plans, a new survey shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Federation of Independent Business said its index of small-business optimism fell 3.3 points in March to 89.6, the lowest reading since the monthly surveys began in 1986.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline was driven by a "sour outlook " for business conditions and real sales growth, and by scaled-back plans to increase employment, the trade group said. "We are seeing recession readings," said William Dunkelberg, its chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, a report from the Labor Department showed that the hiring rate at U.S. companies has been on a downward trend for nearly two years, and that the number of job openings have declined in the past six months. While the manufacturing and construction sectors continue to bear the brunt of the decline, weakness in business services accelerated in February, according to the department's latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, problems persist in the housing market. The National Association of Realtors said its index of pending home sales dropped 1.9% in February to 84.6, the lowest reading since the group began reporting the data in 2001. January's reading was a revised 86.2. Pending sales -- transactions that have been signed but not yet closed -- were down 21.4% in February, compared with a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NFIB survey showed that prices pose a growing challenge for small-business owners. The percentage who cited inflation as their biggest problem rose to the highest level since 1982, when the NFIB was conducting quarterly, rather than monthly, surveys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The combination of a slowing economy and rising prices is taking a bite out of profits; the percentage of small-business owners reporting earnings gains dropped to its lowest level in five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No respondent complained about credit problems, evidence that the credit mess on Wall Street isn't exacerbating woes on Main Street. But that could also mean more trouble ahead if credit conditions continue to deteriorate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George Booth, chief executive of Black Rock Capital LLC, a commercial-equipment finance company with six employees based in Bridgewater, Conn., says his company faces significant challenges. "The biggest problem is that everyone's in a holding pattern because nobody has any confidence." he said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty  </div><div>964 words</div><div>9 April 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C12</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the housing slump drags on, sales are so slow that many real-estate agents are giving up or barely scraping by. But one group of brokers is thriving: those who specialize in selling bank-owned properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosed homes are "the only game in town," says Larry Salas of All-Star Realty Sales in Miami. His firm has about 150 homes listed for sale, all of them foreclosed properties, up from 25 or 30 a year and a half ago. Mr. Salas has never seen such a weak market in more than 30 years as a real-estate agent, and that suits his firm perfectly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously occupied homes nationwide last year totaled 5.65 million, down 20% from the record set in 2005, and sales are expected to fall further this year. So some real-estate agents are moving on to other occupations. Membership in the National Association of Realtors has fallen to 1.24 million from a peak of 1.37 million in October 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Joseph Iuliucci, a Las Vegas foreclosure specialist at Prudential Americana Group, has never been busier. He has more than 500 listings and was among the top 10 home sellers nationwide for the <span class="companylink">Prudential Real Estate</span> franchise chain last year. Mr. Iuliucci needs a staff of 22 agents and assistants to stay on top of things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data from First American CoreLogic, a research firm based in Santa Ana, Calif., show that lender-owned homes account for roughly one out of nine homes listed for sale. In some places, sales of lender-owned homes or ones threatened with foreclosure are dominating local markets. Foreclosure-related transactions accounted for 52% of all sales in the Las Vegas area in March, according to the Greater Las Vegas Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once a month or so, Prudential's Mr. Iuliucci takes prospective buyers on bus tours of foreclosure hot spots, such as a cul de sac where five of seven houses are lender-owned. Such tours are becoming common across the country. Coshow Real Estate Group, a real-estate brokerage in San Diego, leased a bus and hung a "Foreclosure Bus Tours" sign on the sides. The firm offers tours of the area every other weekend, either of foreclosed condos or single-family homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carla Coshow, the firm's founder, says that finding foreclosed properties can be tricky, because lenders don't list all of them on multiple-listing services, databases used by real-estate agents to keep track of homes for sale. "We think that one-half of the property is not on the multiple-listing service," she says. The banks "believe that prices are going to go back up and are holding on."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At one of Coshow's tours on a recent Saturday, about 25 prospective buyers arrived at Coshow's office to be met by a group of agents and a table laid out with pastries and drinks. Each participant was given a "Repo Express" name tag and a booklet listing the seven condos to be visited that day. For each listing, there was detailed financial information, including the current asking price and what the previous owner paid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're not saying these prices are what anybody should offer," Ms. Coshow said as the bus headed for its first stop. "But at least they're reasonable."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FIS Asset Management Solutions, of Westminster, Colo., organizes sales of foreclosed homes for its bank customers, using a nationwide network of local brokers. Chad Neel, president of FIS Asset Management, says he has a list of 30,000 brokers who specialize in bank-owned properties. His company has pruned the number of brokers it actively works with to less than 4,000, giving more homes to those considered most effective.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of those brokers is Chuck Braniff, who sells foreclosed homes in Flint, Mich. Mr. Braniff has spent more than 15 years building up his relationships with firms like FIS and with the employees of banks who dispose of foreclosed homes, known in the trade as "real-estate owned," or REO, properties. In return for a steady flow of listings, banks expect him to do such tasks as monitoring homes that are heading for foreclosure and arranging for repairs when thieves rip out copper pipes. He carries a can of pepper spray to ward off dogs in tough neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks often pay the listing agent a 2% commission rather than the 2.5% to 3% often commanded by those listing ordinary homes. "We work our tails off, and they take part of the commission," Mr. Braniff says. But he isn't complaining. Mr. Braniff has three children in college and prizes the steady flow of work he gets from foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent afternoon, Mr. Braniff walked through a three-bedroom foreclosed home in a middle-class suburb that went on sale five months ago at $149,000 and finally found a buyer at $95,000 in March. The home had a walk-in closet, a whirlpool bath and pinkish shag carpeting in one of the bedrooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A couple of years ago," Mr. Braniff said, "this was a $175,000 house." Much of the problem is Flint's loss of industrial jobs, but there are other factors. Looking through the homes, "you almost inevitably find out," Mr. Braniff says. "Drugs, death, divorce, gambling."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One question is how to advertise these homes. Some brokers like Mr. Braniff think buyers sniff a bargain and get excited when they see "bank-owned" on the for-sale sign. But banks often think such signs create a stigma that is best avoided.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At NYC's Plaza, Quest   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For $100 Million Sale   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Italian businessman Luigi Zunino, who is in contract to buy an apartment at New York's Plaza condominium, is already seeking someone to pay $100 million for it, people familiar with the matter say.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zunino, chief executive of Milan-based property company  <span class="companylink">Risanamento SpA</span>, hasn't yet closed on the third-floor apartment of 10,000 square feet, the people say. The agreed-upon purchase price couldn't be learned, but Plaza condos have sold for $4,000 to more than $6,000 per square foot. A spokesman for Mr. Zunino confirmed the condo contract but declined to elaborate.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The storied 1907 Plaza Hotel has recently reopened as a mix of hotel and condo units. Owners include  <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns</span> Chairman James Cayne and developer Harry Macklowe, who bought an apartment for nearly $60 million last June. A $100 million price, or roughly $10,000 per square foot, would test the upper limits of Manhattan's market. The residential record there is likely an apartment at The Pierre that sold for $8,000 per square foot, several brokers say.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares in Mr. Zunino's property company closed Thursday at 1.80 euros ($2.82) on the Milan Stock Exchange, down from more than 8 euros a year ago. Last summer, his company paid more than $1,400 per square foot, a then-record valuation for U.S. commercial real estate, for the midtown Manhattan office building housing luxury retailer Barney's.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Streep's Former House   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drops 17.5% in Price   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just two months after listing it at $16.8 million, the owner of Meryl Streep's former New York City town house has slashed the price by $3 million, or 17.5%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the new asking price of $13.85 million is still $1 million more than what the current owner paid six months ago. The listing marks the third time in four years that the 25-foot-wide, five-story town house in the Greenwich Village neighborhood has gone on the market. It measures 6,800 square feet with seven bedrooms and has a garden and roof terrace.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Streep bought the 1840s Greek Revival house, with many original details, in the mid-1990s for $2.2 million. In late 2005, the Oscar-winning actress sold the house for $9.1 million to pharmaceutical heiress Elizabeth Ross "Libet" Johnson. In September 2007, Ms. Johnson, who had made no improvements to the house, sold it to an undisclosed investment buyer for $12.85 million, 41% higher.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six months later, the investor listed the home for $16.8 million, a 31% price increase. But he recently cut the price to signal he is a serious seller, according to his listing agent, George van der Ploeg, of Prudential Douglas Elliman.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GE Executive's House   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Key Largo on Sale   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Key Largo, Fla., home of the  <span class="companylink">General Electric</span> aviation executive Brian Rowe, who died in February at age 75, is on the market for $18.9 million.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property spans a double-sized 1.3-acre lot and has six bedrooms, an elevator, a pool and a spa. Mr. Rowe and his wife, Jill, paid $4 million for the oceanfront property in 1995, the year Mr. Rowe retired as chairman of GE's aircraft-engine division. The 1989, 8,000-square-foot house is in Ocean Reef, a private development popular with U.S. business leaders. Russell Post, of  <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>, has the listing.   </p>

</div><div class="author">By Michael Corkery   </div><div>836 words</div><div>2 April 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C15</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long insulated from the gale-force winds buffeting most U.S. housing markets, the New York City market is showing signs of softening just as Wall Street layoffs could put a further damper on demand.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan has been one of the hottest housing markets in the country, with prices of many homes more than doubling since 2003. But real-estate agents agree that tightening lending standards and eroding consumer confidence -- which have crippled housing markets across the country -- are starting to slow the New York City juggernaut.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't know anyone in the industry who can say that their business was the same as it was last year," says Doug Heddings, a senior vice president at Prudential Douglas Elliman, who runs a sales team in Manhattan.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just how much of a slowdown, though, is a matter of debate. Sales volume of condos and cooperatives in Manhattan dropped 34%, to 2,282 units, in the first quarter from a year ago, an unusually sharp decline, according to Miller Samuel Inc., an appraisal-and-research firm that tracks New York real estate. But a separate report issued Wednesday by Halstead Property LLC, a Manhattan-based real-estate firm, showed a 1% decline in sales in Manhattan when compared with a year ago.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike many cities, New York doesn't have a multiple-listing service for homes, which can complicate efforts to calculate sales information. Analysts often use data from individual companies in the industry, which can at times show discrepancies.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all the news is bad. Miller Samuel and Halstead agree prices are rising. The median price for Manhattan homes rose 13%, to $945,276, in the first quarter, according to Miller Samuel. Halstead said the price increase was partly driven by sales at the ultrahigh end of the market, including two homes that sold for more than $40 million each.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But slowing sales volume, not lower prices, can be an early sign of a weakening market. Meanwhile, many brokers agree that the number of homes for sale is rising and buyers are becoming more tepid. "We are not looking at a robust real-estate economy going forward," says Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel Real Estate Appraisers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Heddings, of Prudential Douglas Elliman, says buyers have been backing away from sales across the city, from the Upper West and East Sides to Lower Manhattan. "People are nervous," he says. "More and more people are backing away at the 11th hour, just before signing a contract."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signs of waning sales come as New York's economy prepares for a wave of job losses on Wall Street. But real-estate agents say it could be six months to a year before the housing market feels the brunt of Wall Street job cuts.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Harlem, agent Klara Madlin says banks are requiring buyers to put more money down. "Instead of loaning 90% they will give 80% because they think prices are likely to go down," says Ms. Madlin, president of Harlem Homes Realty Inc. So far, she says, there have been price discounts of 1% to 2%, mostly by developers who agree to pay the closing costs to quickly move a new condo, but there have been no drastic price cuts.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it is common for inventory to rise before the spring and summer selling season, Mr. Miller says the current supply "seems on the high side."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another cause for concern is the number of condominiums being built amid the slowing market. This year, developers are expected to complete 10,200 condos, more than double the 4,100 that were built in 2006, according to REIS Inc., a real-estate research firm.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agents aren't anticipating the sharp drops in prices that hammered New York real estate during the Wall Street collapse in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when about 100,000 people lost their jobs, according to  <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com. The research firm estimates about 33,000 people will lose their jobs amid the current financial stress.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several factors may save the city's real-estate market from distress. For one, there has been far less speculative building than before the last crash. Secondly, Manhattan has largely skirted the subprime-mortgage debacle that sank markets in Florida and California. That is partly because many co-op boards require sizable personal assets and an average down payment of 35%, says Mr. Miller.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also helping New York sales are wealthy buyers from Europe, Asia and the Middle East who are taking advantage of the weak dollar to snap up multimillion-dollar condos and townhomes as second and even third homes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While two-bedroom apartments and studios have been selling briskly, "one-bedrooms seem to be on pause," says Alison Rogers, an agent at DG Neary Realty in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood. "They are popping into contract and popping back out again."   </p>

</div><div class="author">A WSJ News Roundup   </div><div>503 words</div><div>2 April 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation's manufacturing activity shrank in March, but at a slower pace than in February, and construction spending fell for a fifth straight month.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management reported Tuesday that its manufacturing index inched higher last month to 48.6 from 48.3 in February.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the second straight month the index was below 50, a level that indicates contraction. The index turned in its weakest quarterly performance since the second quarter of 2003. It also pointed to rising cost pressures on manufacturers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Norbert Ore, chairman of the ISM's manufacturing business survey committee, said that while there was "nothing great" about the March number, it suggested "we're moving sideways, rather than into a major manufacturing downturn."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added that while parts of the manufacturing sector -- including furniture, textiles and wood products -- have been in a sharp downturn for more than a year, the balance of manufacturing is "holding up quite well."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate survey showed that global factory activity in March weakened to its slowest pace since May 2003. The  <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> global manufacturing index for last month was 50.8, down from 51.1 in February, suggesting the sector is still expanding, but barely.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. construction spending, hurt by a severe slump in the housing market, fell 0.3% in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.122 trillion, the Commerce Department said. Spending dropped 1% in January. The decline was smaller than many analysts expected.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last time construction outlays rose was in September 2007.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential construction spending decreased 0.9% in February to $463.8 billion after falling 1.9% in January. Residential spending was 18.6% lower in February than it was a year ago. Nonresidential construction spending increased 0.1% in February, as spending climbed on roads and hotels.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists at  <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns</span> said the ISM report -- in particular, a subindex that showed a decline in new orders -- pointed to further contraction in factory activity this month. But the economists added that "manufacturing may suffer less in this recession than typical recessions," partly because inventory levels remain well controlled.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides the decline in new orders, another part of the ISM report sparked significant concern: A gauge of prices surged to 83.5 in March from 75.5 in February.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ore called the rise in prices a "grave concern," adding that the increases will put strong pressure on manufacturers' margins for the rest of the year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On construction, private-sector construction spending declined by 0.5% to $826.6 billion. Spending fell 1.5% in January.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Public, or government, construction spending increased 0.4% in February to $294.9 billion. Federal government construction outlays rose 1.4%, but state and local spending -- which is much larger than federal spending in dollars -- increased 0.4% to $274.3 billion. Overall, January public construction outlays increased 0.4%.   </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Ground Zero for Home Distress --- Bargain-Hunters Descend on Cape Coral-Fort Myers, Fla.; 'We're Just Dumping It'   </span>
</div><div class="author">By June Fletcher   </div><div>1169 words</div><div>28 March 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>W8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lee County, Florida -- Here in the distressed-home capital of America, worried sellers keep slashing prices. Growing numbers of bargain-hungry buyers are circling. Both groups have the same question: How much more will prices fall?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February, the Cape Coral-Fort Myers metro area in southwest Florida had the highest foreclosure rate in the nation, according to RealtyTrac of Irvine, Calif., which tracks notices of mortgage default, house-auction notices and bank repossessions. The area had a record 3,739 properties in some stage of foreclosure, or one per 84 households -- almost seven times the national average.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As foreclosures rose, asking prices tumbled. That has resulted in discounts of 40% or more on properties ranging from mansions to modest tract houses. In February, median sale prices for single-family houses in Lee County, which encompasses Fort Myers and Cape Coral, fell 17%, to $211,900, from a year earlier, the Florida Association of Realtors says. (Nationwide, median prices were down a record 8.2% in February from a year earlier, to $195,900, the National Association of Realtors says.)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price cuts are particularly steep in Cape Coral, which had lots of cheap vacant land when the area's building boom began six years ago. Rapidly rising home prices attracted big national builders and prompted small local ones to ramp up production. Now, many of these sandy subdivisions are full of unoccupied houses -- some just half-finished.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Matey, a Cape Coral builder, leans on the granite counter of an empty riverfront house he built for New York real-estate marketer Ted Kurz. Mr. Matey says the 5,139-square-foot house, with five bedrooms, wood-coffered ceilings and river views, was advertised at $4.2 million three years ago. The asking price is now $2.4 million -- which covers only the cost of land and construction. "At this point, we're just dumping it," Mr.Matey says. Mr. Kurz says he'd like to hold on to the house for a few years until the market turns, but that would cost him more than $200,000 in interest, taxes and other expenses -- money he doesn't have now that the market has collapsed. "I'll entertain any offer," he says.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such willingness to deal is attracting shoppers. Coldwell Banker says the number of house showings its agents conducted in southwest Florida almost tripled in February from the same month a year earlier. Sales are picking up, especially in Cape Coral, where some buyers are snagging houses for as little as half the original asking price. Agent Cindy Roper says bidding wars -- rarely seen since the height of the housing bubble -- have broken out for some foreclosed houses. In one recent case, a client missed out on a $329,000 waterfront property that attracted 12 bids after only 10 days on the market, she says.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of existing single-family houses sold in Fort Myers-Cape Coral was flat at 445 in February from a year earlier, while 181 condos were sold, up 19%, says the Florida Association of Realtors. Roughly 18% of these properties were in some stage of foreclosure, according to figures compiled by RealtyTrac.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agents say the fire-sale prices have been particularly attractive to Europeans and Canadians, who have seen their purchasing power rise as the dollar's value has fallen. Lyle and Janet Reinhart, of Vernon, British Columbia, have been checking out houses in the $250,000-to-$300,000 range. "I've been overwhelmed by the choices," says Mr. Reinhart, a retired oil-company executive. He says he's looked at more than 20 houses since January, all reduced 20% to 40% from their original prices.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even with the cuts, many houses aren't selling. Bobby Driscoll, a retired  <span class="companylink">United Parcel Service</span> manager and real-estate agent, put his 10,500-square-foot mansion on the market six months ago for $10 million. He's since slashed the price by $2 million. The six-bedroom spread, with a dock and faux-painted ceilings, is in a riverfront area that was a hotbed of teardowns and speculative building during the boom. Even at its new price, his house remains the most expensive one on the market in Cape Coral. "I may wind up here for a long time," he says.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all of Lee County has been hard-hit. Agent Sabina Carsten says there aren't many deals on the upscale vacation-home islands of Sanibel and Captiva -- partly because they were slow to recover from hurricane damage in 2004 and 2005, and missed the overbuilding of those years. Prices are also holding up in tony Bonita Springs. Still, there are foreclosure specials to be had in that town: Early this month, a lender reduced the price of a five-bedroom house with solid mahogany doors on palm-lined Snarkage Drive to $2.75 million from $3.795 million, a 28% cut, and a four-bedroom home across the pink-paved street was reduced 32% to $2.295 million from $3.395 million.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Veteran Flipper Snags a 'Steal'   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tim Post bought a waterfront penthouse in Cape Coral, Fla., last month for 40% off the original asking price. "It was a steal," he says.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Post, a Syracuse, N.Y., locksmith, has been investing in real estate for two decades, buying handyman specials, fixing them up while he lives in them and selling for a profit. He's turned around more than a dozen houses this way. So when he read about how weak southwest Florida's real-estate market had become, he decided to take a look.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over six weeks he toured more than 200 homes looking for deals. He finally settled on a two-bedroom penthouse with sweeping marina views on the 14th floor of a high-rise. It had been bought in September 2006 by an investor in preconstruction for $472,900, and put back on the market in May 2007 for $499,000. Mr. Post bought it for $300,000 in a "short sale" -- a deal where the bank or other lender is willing to accept less than what is owed on a house to avert the costs of foreclosure. "You can't build a place like this for $300,000," Mr. Post says.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He's turned the penthouse into his winter vacation home, and is thrilled that he didn't have to fix it up: It already had upgraded tile floors, cherry cabinets and stainless appliances. The condo's previous owner, an investor, had never lived in it.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Mr. Post plans to hold on to the place for at least five years, he isn't spooked by the possibility that prices may fall further. "I'm absolutely optimistic that the market will come back -- it always does," he says.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sidney Kimmel to Sell   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home for $81.5 Million   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apparel mogul and movie producer Sidney Kimmel agreed to sell his Palm Beach, Fla., house for the asking price, $81.5 million, according to a person close to the deal.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale, if it closes, is the highest in Palm Beach and one of the largest sums paid for a U.S. single-family property. It suggests that even as the housing market melts the richest Americans seem to have little trouble selling their homes. The house spent just 24 days on the market, says listing agent Paulette Koch, of  <span class="companylink">Corcoran Group</span>, who declined to confirm the sale price.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kimmel, 80 years old, paid $5.5 million in 1993 for the property's five oceanfront acres and spent five years building a limestone villa designed by Thierry W. Despont, who's also worked for Bill Gates. The contemporary 30,000-square-foot structure has 115-foot-long exposed mahogany beams, massive retractable glass wall panels and a Murano glass-tiled outdoor pool.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kimmel, a producer of such films as "The Kite Runner," founded  <span class="companylink">Jones Apparel.</span> The billionaire and his wife, Caroline, paid $35 million to $40 million for a house in Malibu, Calif., last year and own apartments in Los Angeles and New York. Cristina Condon, of  <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>, represented the buyer.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2001, former Global Crossing chairman Gary Winnick acquired a Bel-Air, Calif., estate for more than $90 million in money and property.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, not all is rosy at the top end. After two years on the market with a $125 million price tag, Donald Trump has dropped the asking price for his Palm Beach spec house to $100 million. And Mr. Trump switched to a new listing agent, broker Lawrence Moens.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stefani Producer   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Raises House Price   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that his new home is almost ready, British music producer Nellee Hooper, known for his work with pop star Gwen Stefani, has relisted his former London house -- at the slightly higher price of GBP 2.6 million (about $5.2 million).   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year the remix artist listed the 1,400-square-foot, 19th century carriage house, in the central London neighborhood of Belgravia, for GBP 2.5 million. But he took it off the market due to delays on his new, larger house nearby, according to his listing agent Thomas Schulz, of Aldine Honey in association with Quintessentially Estates. The three-story house includes an open-plan dining, living and library area. The custom furniture may also be included in the sale, at an additional price.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hooper, who worked with Bjoerk on songs like her popular "Hyperballad," bought the house about four years ago and renovated in a modern style with ebonized wood floors and wall panels.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California Ranch   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sells for $21 Million   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Santa Barbara County, an 80-acre ranch has sold for $21 million, more than 10 times what the sellers paid in 1993: $2.05 million.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The appreciation indicates that despite the collapse of the housing market in parts of California and elsewhere, property values in many locations are still well up from the past decade. The ranch, on Ortega Ridge Road, was listed at $20 million. The property includes a 1983 house with ocean views, a pool and a tennis court.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sellers are local landowners Ellen Knill and her husband, Harry. The buyers, an American family, plan to use the home as a private residence, according to listing agent Frank Abatemarco, of  <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty.</span> Broker Kelly Haeseker, of Global Realty, represented the buyers.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Orders for big-ticket manufactured goods fell in February, a sign of weakening business demand. Sales of newly built homes also were down.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for durable goods -- those designed to last three years or more -- declined 1.7% to a seasonally adjusted $210.7 billion, following a 4.7% drop in January, the U.S. Commerce Department said Wednesday. A barometer of business investment -- orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft -- fell 2.6% in February.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, new-home sales continued to drop despite a downturn in construction and falling prices, the department said. Sales of single-family homes declined 1.8% in February to an annual rate of 590,000, and were 29.8% lower than a year earlier. The median new-home price was $244,100 during the month, down 2.7% from a year earlier.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of unsold new homes fell for the 11th straight month to 471,000, but the inventory of unsold new homes at current sales rates was unchanged at 9.8 months.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cap Rates Rise, Mostly,   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Except for Apartments   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Capitalization rates for most commercial real-estate sectors have been rising in recent months, with one exception: apartment buildings. In February, the average cap rate for apartment buildings was 6.08%, unchanged from January. Meanwhile, the average cap rate for office properties in central-business districts jumped to 5.96% from 5.42%. The cap rate is a calculation of rental income in the first year of ownership, divided by the purchase price.   </p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty and Kris Hudson   </div><div>1512 words</div><div>26 March 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Asia</div><div>AWSJ</div><div>37</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2008 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A glut of foreclosed homes of historic proportions is starting to drive down U.S. home prices faster as lenders put more properties on the market and buyers show signs of interest.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ability of America's lenders to manage this fire sale will be crucial to determining how long the housing market stays in the dumps -- and how quickly blighted neighborhoods can heal. The oversupply is severe: In some major markets, including Las Vegas and San Diego, foreclosure-related sales have accounted for more than 40% of all sales in recent months.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, new data suggested that pressures like these are starting to drive prices low enough to attract some buyers back into the market. Sales of previously occupied homes jumped 2.9% in February from the month before, the National Association of Realtors said, the first increase since July.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price dropped 8.2% from a year earlier to $195,900, the biggest drop recorded by the Realtors in the current slump.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some beaten-down markets, the price cuts have been stark. The Detroit Board of Realtors recently found that home sales in the city (excluding suburbs) in the first two months of this year jumped 48% from a year earlier, to 1,540. The average home price there sank 54% to about $22,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks and others holding foreclosed property have concluded "we've got to move things" and are finally willing to slash prices, said Thomas Lawler, a housing economist in Virginia.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply is piling up fast. Overall, the total number of lender-owned homes doubled last year but sales grew only 4.4%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the specialist firms that sell foreclosed homes for lenders say banks are sending them additional properties much faster than they can be sold. "They're coming in [at a rate of] two new properties for every sale," said Claudia Smith, vice president of operations for First American REO Outsourcing, which is handling roughly 8,000 foreclosed homes for lenders.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First American CoreLogic, a research firm based in California that collects data from lenders and county clerks, estimates that foreclosed properties held by lenders accounted for 493,000 of all homes on the market in January, up from 231,000 a year before. Properties like these represent roughly one of nine listed for sale in the U.S., compared with one in 15 a year earlier.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is both a crisis and an opportunity," says Rafael Cestero, a senior vice president at Enterprise Community Partners, a national nonprofit group that invests in housing for low-income people. Clusters of empty, foreclosed homes attract criminals and hurt neighborhoods by undercutting property values for everyone. Brenda Lawrence, mayor of Southfield, Michigan, where about 3% of all single-family homes are in foreclosure, calls foreclosed homes "a cancer."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But foreclosures also can help bring prices in high-cost areas down to levels that are affordable to teachers, firefighters and other middle-class buyers who may have been priced out of the market during the housing boom.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. Rep. Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat, recently announced plans for legislation to provide $10 billion of federal loans and grants to help local government and nonprofit groups buy and renovate vacant foreclosed homes. The homes would have to be sold or rented to people with low or moderate incomes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overabundance of foreclosed homes in the market is likely to push down home prices in much of the U.S. for the next several years, says Ivy Zelman, chief executive of Zelman &amp; Associates, a housing-research firm in Cleveland.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently, all of this distressed property has been encouraging potential buyers to stay on the sidelines in anticipation of lower prices later. But Lawrence Yun, chief economist of the National Association of Realtors, says the latest data show that sales are perking up in some areas where owners of foreclosed homes have become more aggressive about their pricing.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prospects for the housing market also depend heavily on the job market. As measured by the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller national index, home prices jumped 74% in the six years through 2006. During the same period, U.S. median household income rose 15%. (Neither figure is adjusted for inflation.) That discrepancy made housing unaffordable for many Americans.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home-price index already has come down about 10% from its peak in mid-2006. But prices might need to fall much further, some analysts say. A recent  <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> report projects that average home prices have another 40% to fall in the Miami metropolitan area, 36% in Phoenix, 26% in Los Angeles and 20% in Las Vegas if they are to become more in line with income levels.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders face dueling pressures when deciding how quickly to sell foreclosed properties. On the one hand, foreclosed homes tend to depreciate faster than occupied ones because they get less maintenance and quickly look forlorn. And the longer they sit unsold, the longer the lender must keep paying monthly expenses, including insurance and property taxes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, lenders must balance the pressure to clear their books with the fact that selling too quickly -- and at deep discounts -- could trigger big write-downs and devastate their quarterly results. "Somebody has to jump on the hand grenade," says Michael Cercone, a real-estate investor in Massachusetts.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William Seidman, a TV commentator and former bank regulator, served as chairman of  <span class="companylink">Resolution Trust Corp.</span>, an agency created by Congress to sell the assets of failed savings and loans in the aftermath of that late-1980s financial crisis. "Our view was that we should sell [real estate] as quickly as possible," he says. Mr. Seidman advises today's sellers to take a similar approach.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases, buyers are ready to act. Marc S. English walked into a private auction of 80 foreclosed homes at an Embassy Suites hotel near Dallas on March 9 and predicted that bargains would be scant due to the attendance of more than 1,000 rival bidders.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you can't make 20%, 25% off these deals, you're wasting your time," said Mr. English, who occasionally buys and sells homes to supplement his regular work with a commercial builder.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet Mr. English wound up buying two of the four homes he had scouted in advance. For instance, he agreed to pay mortgage investor Fannie Mae $37,000 for a three-bedroom, two-bathroom home in Fort Worth, Texas, with a value of $69,600 in the county appraiser's records. After the auction, the lenders initially rejected his winning bids as too low. But a week later, they relented.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fastest way to move foreclosed homes might be to sell in bulk to big investors, although that kind of transaction is highly unusual in the real-estate business. Nevertheless, some hedge-fund operators, including New York-based Paulson &amp; Co., are considering whether to seek deals like these. There are big obstacles, however. One problem: Hedge funds aren't equipped to manage small properties scattered over large areas.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another sticking point is price. Mary Coffin, an executive vice president who heads the loan-servicing business of  <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>, says investors have approached her bank to discuss "fire sale" bulk purchases of homes, at as little as 20% to 30% of what the bank thinks the properties are worth.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're not there," Ms. Coffin says.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She says she thinks Wells can do better than that by selling homes one by one. Still, she says, Wells needs to prepare for the possibility of doing some bulk sales.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonprofit groups are angling to get in on the action. Enterprise Community Partners plans to provide financing for local organizations to buy foreclosed homes and renovate them for sale or rent. Enterprise's Mr. Cestero says the group expects to raise at least $50 million to $75 million initially from foundations, financial institutions and other sources for such programs in Cleveland, Dallas, New York, Baltimore and Columbus, Ohio. Mr. Cestero says Enterprise Community Partners potentially could pay 50% to 70% of a property's estimated value. It has held talks with big lenders, although no deals have been reached.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the most dire cases, some lenders have teamed up with community-service groups essentially to donate foreclosed homes for use by low-income residents. In December, Fannie Mae began transferring 182 foreclosed homes, most of them in Detroit, to the Michigan State Housing Development Authority and the Michigan Land Bank Fast Track Authority. The agencies paid $32,000 for the entire group of 182 homes -- enough to cover title-processing charges on each home. Once the titles are cleared, the agencies will donate the properties, which range in value from $5,000 to $70,000, to Michigan municipalities, charities and housing programs.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. stock market was mixed after a weak reading on consumer confidence added to the glum tone set by data showing home prices declined in January by the largest margin in more than 20 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In early-afternoon trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 28.90 points, or 0.2%, to 12519.74. The Nasdaq Composite Index edged up 0.3%, or 6.75, to 2333.50, and the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index rose 0.2%, or 1.96, to 1351.84.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest dose of weak housing news squelched optimism sparked in Monday's session from data showing a monthly rise in sales of existing homes. Together, the recent releases underscore the idea that lower prices may draw some buyers into the housing market, but the rapid plunge in the value of many homes could also wreak havoc on the personal finances of many current homeowners.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes in the U.S. climbed for the first time in seven months in February as buyers took advantage of falling prices.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing U.S. homes rose for the first time in seven months last month as sharply falling prices attracted buyers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales rose to an annual rate of 5.03 million units, a 2.9% increase from January, the National Association of Realtors said. February sales were down 23.8% from a year earlier.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home price fell 8.2% to $195,900 last month from $213,500 a year earlier.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're not expecting a notable gain in existing-home sales until the second half of this year, but the improvement is another sign that the market is stabilizing, said Lawrence Yun, the Realtors' economist.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories of unsold homes fell 3% to 4.03 million at the end of February, representing a 9.6-month supply at the February sales pace. That was down from a 10.2-month supply at the end of January.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes rose 2.5% in the Midwest, 11.3% in the Northeast and 2.1% in the South. Sales fell 1.1% in the West.   </p>

</div><div class="author">By Gene Epstein   </div><div>422 words</div><div>23 March 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Sunday</div><div>SNJR</div><div>2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite upbeat predictions from many in the housing industry, the nationwide slump in home prices could last for a long, long time -- especially if you count the toll exacted by inflation.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just look at what happened in the '80s and '90s. The inflation-adjusted average price of an existing home peaked in 1979, didn't bottom out until 1984 and didn't return to the 1979 level until 1995.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, "real" -- that is, inflation-adjusted -- home prices went nowhere for 16 years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Granted, inflation during that period was running at an average of 4.7%, versus 2.6% since 1995. But that doesn't mean real home prices will now fare better.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chief economist Lawrence Yun of the National Association of Realtors predicts that nominal house prices will bottom out by the middle of this year, and then resume a 3%-plus yearly increase.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not bad, on the surface -- but possibly no better than inflation.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing does remain a good hedge against inflation over very long periods. Examine any 20-year stretch since 1970 and you'll find that home prices, adjusted for inflation, rose.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House prices tend to rise faster than the consumer-price index over the long run because the land on which houses are built is inherently limited -- and not least because the availability of land has been curtailed by regulation, which is unlikely to go away.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One bright spot in the housing realm: Most sales this year have been profitable for the sellers, even though the median price is down nearly 10% in the past two years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's because the holding period on a home is typically six years, not one or two, as the scare stories in the media often imply.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means that those who sold in early 2008, on average, didn't buy at the higher prices of last year or two years ago, but at the lower prices of six years ago. So in both nominal and real dollars, these typical sellers made a profit.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the past is any guide, homes will continue to provide investors with solid protection against inflation for periods of 20 years or more. The problem is, a lot of us may not want to hang on to our homes for two decades. During shorter periods -- even stretches of 16 years -- the asset can be disappointing.   </p>

</div><div class="author">By Jennifer S. Forsyth and Jonathan Karp </div><div>1391 words</div><div>22 March 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The condominium market is about to get worse as many cities brace for a flood of new supply this year -- the result of construction started at the height of the housing boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 4,000 new units will be completed in both Atlanta and Phoenix by the end of the year. Developers in Miami and Fort Lauderdale, Fla., are readying nearly 10,000 total new units in a market already struggling with canyons of unsold condos. San Diego, another hard-hit region, will add 2,500 units, according to estimates provided by <span class="companylink">Reis Inc.</span>, a New York-based real-estate-research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new building comes on top of unprecedented supply. The U.S. finished 2007 with a supply of condos large enough to absorb 10 months of demand, the highest level since the National Association of Realtors began the tally in 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deluge means bad news for developers and potentially lower prices, including in cities such as Atlanta and Dallas that have avoided the worst of the housing bust. If defaults and foreclosures rise, lenders will feel the pain too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regulators have been sounding the alarm for weeks about the exposure of small and mid-size banks to commercial real estate, which mostly means construction loans to developers of condos and single-family housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders of all sizes have $42 billion of condominium debt on their books, according to Foresight Analytics. In just three months -- between the third and fourth quarters of last year -- the delinquency rate rose to 10% from 5.9%, says the Oakland, Calif., research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The news isn't bad for everyone. Vulture buyers have started to circle, hoping to take advantage of foreclosed properties that banks may start dumping at fire-sale prices. Also, some condos are being converted to rental units, increasing supply for renters and putting downward pressure on prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may seem surprising that anyone would want to add supply to a market whose troubles have been well-publicized for many months. But the economics of condo building encourage developers to bring half-finished projects to completion, even when prices and demand are plunging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers usually put up their own money for a project first, then spend borrowed funds. Once developers have spent their money and have commitments from lenders, they have a strong incentive to keep building to finish the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These developers had millions of dollars tied up and they had them financed so they just moved forward," says J. Ronald Terwilliger, chief executive of <span class="companylink">Trammell Crow Residential</span>, which builds many rental apartment buildings and also some condos. "What they hope is that by the time the project is finished the market comes back."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, developers and lenders can more easily shelve projects that are still in the early stages. Many developments nationwide are being canceled, suggesting that by next year or 2010, the number of new condos coming onto the market may slow to a trickle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One big question hanging over the market is how many of the buyers who have put down deposits during construction will show up to close the deal. Some deposits were as little as 3% of the purchase price. The price of a condo has frequently fallen more than the amount of the deposit, giving the buyer an incentive to forfeit the deposit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, if a buyer put down $50,000 for a unit priced at $500,000, and the value falls to $400,000, the buyer is apt to walk away -- or find some fault with the unit and sue the developer to get the deposit back. Furthermore, some buyers who still want to move in are finding that they no longer qualify for mortgage loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Miami, only 57 units in the 118-unit Onyx on the Bay have closed since August 2007, leaving the remaining 61 units in the possession of the developer, according to Miami-Dade County records. Willy Bermello, the Onyx's developer, could not be reached.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deteriorating economy isn't helping. "When the world goes to hell in a handbasket, the last thing anyone wants to buy is a condo," says Cathy Schlegel, a mortgage-loan broker in Fort Worth, Texas, whose condo in a high-rise called The Tower sat on the market for 14 months before she finally sold it at a loss in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rising supply is a reflection of the picture in 2004 through 2006 -- a time of huge demand for condos. Speculation was rampant as investors believed empty nesters and young professionals seeking an urban experience akin to what they watched on "Friends" would prop up the condo market for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most projects take about three years from the time they are marketed to potential buyers to the time they are ready to be moved into. Deposits help developers get a construction loan that is to be paid off when the buyers close on their new condos years later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, cancellations are rising, meaning developers may not be able to pay back their banks. Peter Zalewski, founder of Condo Vultures Realty LLC in Miami, says condo developers he is working with are expecting 20% to 40% of buyers who put down deposits to walk away from the deal. In some areas, such as inland buildings and new projects along the river in Miami "walkaways" are expected to be even higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike single-family housing, condos tend to be concentrated in certain areas, meaning the pain is limited to pockets of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Jacksonville, Fla., developer Cameron Kuhn had planned to redevelop the SunTrust office tower into office condos as part of a larger complex that included residential condos. Now the condo tower is on hold, dashing city officials' hopes that the project would help to bring parking, residents and more life to the downtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices of condos have been steady in some areas and fallen elsewhere. The median condo sales price in the Cape Coral-Fort Myers area of Florida fell 26% to $202,300 in the fourth quarter of 2007 from $273,400 a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices dropped nearly 20% in Tucson, Ariz., and 12% in the Atlanta area during that time, according to National Association of Realtors data. Inside the newly minted Quantum on the Bay in Miami, prices for two-bedroom units have fallen from the high $700,000s to around $500,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One option for a developer is to convert the condos to apartments. However, these projects are usually financed with the presumption that sales of individual condos pay off more than rents from a comparably sized apartment building. Also, lenders typically expect developers to pay off condo construction loans with the millions of dollars they receive when closing on the sales. Such a quick payout isn't possible if the developer is only receiving monthly rental payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Terwilliger says Trammell Crow plans its condo developments with an eye towards converting them into rentals if necessary. But its profits are cut when it does that because the company typically spends more for land and amenities when developing condos, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A project called ATLofts at the mammoth Atlantic Station project in downtown Atlanta presold about 80% of its 303 units in a mixed-use building that had condos above retail space. But the project ran into water-infiltration problems. That gave buyers an out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developer, <span class="companylink">Lane Co.</span>, ended up turning about half the units into rentals. The developer of the retail space, Atlantic Town Center, bought the remaining 156 units as condos. Today, only 52 of those have sold, according to Haddow &amp; Co., an Atlanta-based real-estate consulting company. An Atlantic Town Center spokesman predicted the remaining condos will sell "considering the prime location."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As more condominium projects get into trouble, investors are looking to pounce. Some 700 people showed up for a distressed-real-estate conference this past week in Miami where the condo glut was the dominant discussion subject.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Valet parking attendants had to wave participants away from the hotel and toward a parking lot at a shopping center, and attendees overwhelmed the conference halls, forcing many to watch the proceedings on screens in adjoining rooms.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GROWTH in U.S. wholesale prices slowed last month as food prices fell, but price growth accelerated in other sectors, a stark reminder that inflation risks remain. Meanwhile, home construction dropped in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The producer-price index for finished goods rose 0.3% on a seasonally adjusted basis, the Labor Department said. The core index, which excludes food and energy items, rose 0.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts fell 0.6% to a seasonally adjusted 1.065 million annual rate, after rising 7.1% in January to 1.071 million, the Commerce Department said. Building permits sank 7.8% to a 978,000 annual rate in February, the lowest since 974,000 in September 1991.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jeff Bater and Brian Blackstone   </div><div>441 words</div><div>19 March 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home construction slipped slightly last month, while building permits, an important gauge of future activity, plunged sharply, signaling further deterioration in the nation's housing market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts declined 0.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.065 million, after increasing a revised 7.1% in January to 1.071 million, the Commerce Department said. Permits for new construction plummeted 7.8% to the lowest level in 16 years, while permits for single-family homes dropped 6.2%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are likely to see further ugly single-family housing-starts numbers over the next three to six months, but then a rebound -- provided financial markets stabilize -- in the second half of this year," said Patrick Newport, an economist at forecasting-firm Global Insight Inc., in a research note.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, U.S. wholesale prices rose 0.3% on a seasonally adjusted basis in February after a 1% increase in January, the Labor Department said. The slower price increase reflected a decline in food prices and a speedup in inflation for consumer products, automobiles and prescription drugs. In the 12 months ended in February, producer prices climbed 6.4%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The so-called core index of producer prices, which excludes food and energy items, rose 0.5% last month, its biggest monthly increase since November 2006. Still, the price data will attract less attention than usual because the government already reported last week that consumer prices were flat last month.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing report showed February starts were 28.4% less than the level of February 2007.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New construction plunged 27.7% in the Northeast last month and was flat in the Midwest. It rose 3.9% in the South and 5.1% in the West. Last month's pace for building permits, 978,000 at an annual rate, was the slowest since September 1991's 974,000 rate. "This implies further construction cuts as builders pare back in the face of weak housing demand," said  <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.</span> economist Michelle Meyer.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family housing starts last month fell 6.7% to a 707,000 rate, while permits declined 6.2%. Construction of housing with two or more units rose 14.4% to a 358,000 pace. Within that category, groundbreakings on multifamily homes -- those with five or more units -- were 14.5% higher.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We look for residential-construction activity to continue to slide for all of 2008, though starts may be relatively close to a bottom," said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital, in a note to clients.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOS ANGELES -- Median-home prices plunged in many of California's most populous counties in February, with Southern California leading the slide with an overall drop of 18% compared with a year earlier, according to housing data released yesterday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drops reflect a deepening housing crisis in the state, which saw home values soar during the housing boom then decline sharply in most areas.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median-home prices fell this year in 15 major counties,  <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> Information Systems said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price in a six-county area of Southern California fell to $408,000 -- the lowest level since October 2004, when it was $402,500. That median is 19% below the region's peak price of $505,000 last summer, and it is 1.7% below January's median,  <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the nine counties of the San Francisco Bay area, the median price fell 12% to $548,000 compared with a year earlier and 18% from the region's peak median price of $665,000 last summer. Bay-area prices were essentially flat from January.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-sales volume also fell last month. Sales declined 39% from a year earlier in Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura counties. In all, 10,777 homes were sold in February in those six counties, up 8% from January,  <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Southern California's home-sales volume has hit lows every month since September.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nine San Francisco-area counties saw a similar slowdown, as sales dropped 37% last month from February 2007. Some 3,989 homes were sold in San Francisco, Marin, San Mateo, Napa, Alameda, Sonoma, Contra Costa, Santa Clara and Solano counties. That was up 11% from January.   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this battered housing market, choosing the right neighborhood is more important than ever.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some six million Americans are expected to buy a house this year. Whether first-time home buyers scouting the Chicago suburbs or a midcareer worker relocating to Denver, they are all contemplating what may be the most significant purchase of their lives at a time when no one is certain how much lower prices might go.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you are relocating for your job, you likely can't pick which region you move to. But you can pick where you live within that region, and that could have a big effect on whether or not your home turns out to be a winning investment.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price declines can last for years. The Greater Boston Association of Realtors says that prices there began falling in 1988 and didn't return to those levels until 1992. Houston's oil-bust downturn of the 1980s lasted a similar amount of time.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are signs the current decline could be worse. National Association of Realtors statistics indicate that housing prices in 2007 experienced their first year-over-year decline in at least 40 years. Prices are expected to fall further this year -- and possibly next year, as well -- as the housing crisis broadens.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even in this brutal landscape, cities such as Seattle; Austin, Texas; and Wichita, Kan., are still seeing price increases. And even in hard-hit cities, certain neighborhoods are holding up better than others.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One factor is well-known to home buyers: schools. Even if you don't have children, houses in high-ranked school districts generally retain their value better.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But don't overlook perhaps the most important variable of all: supply and demand. With the exception of cities such as Detroit, where housing markets are weakened by ailing industries, prices are tumbling hardest in places like Phoenix or Miami or Las Vegas, which were smothered in recent years by new construction. If you are moving to one of these cities, be wary of areas where lots of new homes are soon to be built or scheduled to go on sale soon.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the boom, builders plastered the Phoenix region with houses that were snapped up quickly, many times by speculators who were looking to score a quick profit. Today, the metro area has more than 18 months of supply, according to data collected by Mark MacKenzie Real Estate Planning, a local real-estate-investment-services brokerage, compared with a national average of 11 months. Yet it is apparent that some parts of Phoenix are substantially weaker than others.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buckeye, a suburb west of Phoenix, sprawls across 600 square miles of desert. Town planners have approved roughly 400,000 houses. But already the supply of homes stretches to nearly 20 months, and that means buyers are "more at risk for [further] decreases in property values," says Mr. MacKenzie.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Maricopa, a rapidly growing suburb 35 miles south of Phoenix, Mike Mendoza, an agent with  <span class="companylink">Keller Williams Realty International</span>, has a listing for a house that has been on the market more than six months. The house, which the owners originally spent $525,000 buying and upgrading in late 2005, is now priced at $449,000 -- "and buyers aren't rushing to it as a bargain," Mr. Mendoza says.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, Tempe, with no room to expand and a location closer to Phoenix's job centers, has an 11-month supply of houses. Tempe's average selling price per square foot in 2007 was just $1 lower than in 2006, according to Multiple Listing Service data.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many house hunters these days, Langford and Carol Jordan are concerned about all these issues. This month, the couple is moving to Denver from Minneapolis for Mr. Jordan's job as a divisional manager for Synergetic Design Inc., an engineering-consulting firm based in Charlotte, N.C. They have visited the city three times and compiled reams of research "because there's a likelihood we may leave Denver in three to five years, and we want to buy something we can sell and not take a bath on it," Mr. Jordan says.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple wants a good school district and an established community. They settled on two towns, Highlands Ranch and Castle Rock, and ultimately chose the latter "because it is an established city with its own downtown," says Mr. Jordan. "It's smaller, and there's a mix of homes -- an area that would appeal to a family like we are when it comes time for us to resell. Highlands Ranch seemed overpopulated and trendy."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the Jordans, a key issue is that Castle Rock is relatively close to work and retail centers in both Denver and Colorado Springs. In many cities during the housing boom, developers ventured far afield to buy cheaper land, expecting that if they built it, buyers would come. And buyers did. But now they aren't so eager for two reasons: Gas is topping $3 a gallon, increasing their commuting costs, and the necessary infrastructure such as schools and retail and medical facilities often haven't sprung up yet.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider Adams County, a once-hot suburban community 20 miles northeast of Denver. "Home building in the last two years grew faster than the supporting pieces" there, says Larry McGee, managing broker at Denver real-estate firm Berkshire Group. And as the economy softens, "the money to build those supporting pieces isn't there, so the lag will probably be worse than elsewhere in Denver." Last year, prices in Adams County fell by about 4.3%, compared with Denver's overall fall of 2.9%, according to Mr. McGee.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though buyers generally get more house for their dollar in more-remote communities, many buyers today are forsaking size for the conveniences of being close to the city, often in areas that are redeveloping.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Salt Lake City area, one of the nation's stronger housing markets, communities such as Holladay, built in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s and less than 10 miles from downtown, are maintaining their value, while those farther out are struggling. Newly remodeled homes in Holladay sell within 30 to 60 days and often have multiple offers, typically without the owners having to cut the price. Homes there are appreciating at 6% to 8% annually, says Dougan Jones, CEO of Prudential Utah Real Estate.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twenty miles south of Salt Lake City, by contrast, homes in Riverton take 120 days or more to sell, don't typically have multiple offers and are usually discounted several thousand dollars off the list price -- though they are just a few years old and are generally larger. Home-price appreciation in Riverton has slowed to about 4% from as much as 12% during the go-go years, says Mr. Jones.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One key variable between the two cities: available land. Holladay has no opportunities for new subdivisions, but "developers in the outlying areas grabbed large tracts of land [contiguous to existing neighborhoods] that are still not developed," Mr. Jones says. "You can rest assured they will be, and that new supply will impact prices of nearby existing homes."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neighborhoods with significant numbers of foreclosures also typically suffer weaker housing prices. In Herndon, Va., an otherwise desirable metropolitan Washington community, "there are pockets of town where foreclosures are a problem, and that is undercutting prices" of nearby homes, says Stephen Fuller, director for the Center for Regional Analysis at George Mason University. "A couple blocks west or north, and you don't find that problem."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, while home prices are up in most of Alexandria and Arlington, Va., prices are down 10% to 15% in Prince William County, about 25 miles outside of Washington. There, nearly a quarter of all the homes on the market are either in foreclosure or are so-called short sales, in which the house is valued at less than the mortgaged amount. Real-estate agents can access a variety of data on foreclosures in a given area, as well as other information to help buyers gauge a particular area.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't forget that home buying is always a street-by-street exercise, and that is particularly true in a weak market. In a strong market, buyers scarf up homes on busy streets or less-than-desirable locations. But in a down market, things change. Just about anything sold in the hot market of 2004 and 2005, but now "it's location, location, location -- more than ever," says Lori Dahl, an agent in Summit, N.J., with Burgdorff Realty ERA.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"></p><pre class="articlePre">                    What Buyers Should Look For 
 
  -- Lots of new home construction in a neighborhood can keep a lid on 
existing prices. 
 
  -- New communities often rise faster than supporting infrastructure 
such as schools, hospitals and retail centers. That can keep prices 
suppressed until those amenities arrive. 
 
  -- Large numbers of foreclosures in a neighborhood or community can 
weaken prices for nearby houses.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial lore says you should buy when there's blood in the street -- which suggests real estate is a bargain, because there's blood all over the neighborhood.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Time to invest? I wouldn't be surprised to see home prices drop sharply this spring, as long-suffering sellers in hard-hit areas throw in the towel and slash their asking price.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That could spell opportunity for this year's buyers. But what if you already own a home -- and have no desire to become a landlord? Here are three ways to play today's battered housing market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Trading up. If you're hankering after a larger home or a house in a better neighborhood, this could be your chance to trade up on the cheap.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, when you go to sell your current home, you will likely get a modest price. Since 2006's second quarter, real estate has fallen 10.2%, as measured by the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index. But your new, grander house will also be relatively inexpensive, so you're effectively cranking up your real-estate exposure when the market is well below its peak.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That said, I wouldn't think of this move as an investment. Your new home will probably mean not only a bigger mortgage, but also higher ongoing costs, including homeowner's insurance, property taxes and maintenance expenses. These ongoing costs will offset a large chunk of any future home-price appreciation.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, trading up to a larger home or a better neighborhood is really about wanting to consume more real estate. Still, like any thrifty shopper, you want to buy when there's a sale -- and that is what today's market offers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's like going from a Honda to a Mercedes," says Charles Farrell, a financial adviser with Denver's Northstar Investment Advisors. "It's a lifestyle choice. As long as it doesn't cut into your ability to accumulate capital for retirement, this is probably a pretty good time to upgrade."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Doubling down. Instead of trading up, you might be eyeing a vacation home. If you don't plan to rent the place out, the same logic applies: Once you subtract the annual costs from the price appreciation, you likely won't make very much money -- which means the property won't be much of an investment.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, maybe you're two or three years from retirement and are toying with buying a second home that could become your sole residence once you quit the work force. Does it make sense to purchase now, given the decline in home prices?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying today is no doubt appealing, because it'll give you a chance to vacation in your future home. But whether it turns out to be a wise financial move depends on what happens to property prices -- and that's tough to predict.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, I wouldn't bank on a rapid bounce back in home prices. At the current sales pace, it would take a whopping 10.3 months to clear January's backlog of unsold homes. By contrast, in January 2005, the supply of unsold homes was at a mere 3.6 months, according to the National Association of Realtors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bottom line: If you think you'll get a lot of use from a second home, go ahead and buy. But if you view the purchase as a bet on rising home prices, I would hold off for now.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Helping hand. While buying more real estate for your own use probably won't be a great investment, you could help your adult children make good money -- by transforming them from renters to homeowners.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To that end, you might give your kids an advance on their eventual inheritance, so they have enough money to make a down payment. Yes, that means they will start to incur the housing costs I mentioned above, including property taxes and maintenance expenses. But your children will also replace their monthly rent check with a monthly mortgage check, and that will allow them to start building home equity.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you have kids who are first-time buyers in markets that are relatively depressed, this could be a good time," Mr. Farrell reckons. "These days, they might need to make a 10% down payment. You could make a gift to them of the down payment or make a loan to them."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"></p><pre class="articlePre">                            Home Economics 
 
  Tempted to trade up to a bigger house or buy a vacation getaway for your 
own use? 
 
  View it as a lifestyle choice, not an investment. 
 
  Budget for costs such as utilities, property taxes, homeowner's insurance 
and maintenance. 
 
  Don't buy if it means cutting back on retirement savings.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of homes available for sale in major metropolitan areas grew modestly in February, new data show.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total listings of homes in 29 metro areas at the end of last month were up 1.2% from a month earlier, according to figures compiled by ZipRealty Inc., a real-estate brokerage firm based in Emeryville, Calif. The data cover all listings of single-family homes, condos and town houses on local multiple-listing services in those areas where Zip operates.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After rising rapidly since 2005, the inventory of unsold homes has leveled off at a high level in recent months. Economists and other market watchers say that is partly because some people who don't have an urgent need to sell soon have pulled their homes off the market and are awaiting a recovery in the market. Ordinary homeowners must compete with builders seeking to unload inventory and lenders that have acquired homes through foreclosure.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory was up 17% from February 2007 in 18 metro areas for which Zip has comparable year-earlier data.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Metro areas with the largest increases in February from a month before included Seattle, up 5.4%; San Francisco, 4.8%; Minneapolis, 4.4%, and Boston, 3.7%. The number of listings in Las Vegas was down 4.4%.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Buckeye, Ariz., a house in a golf development went into contract for about $800,000 in 2006 but didn't close, according to builder Cachet Homes. The house eventually sold for $520,000, 35% below that. In some editions of Friday's Weekend Journal, a caption for an article on bargain-hunting home buyers incorrectly put the contract at $960,000, the year as 2007 and the price drop at 46%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(WSJ March 8, 2008)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END) </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Intrepid home shoppers are venturing back into some of the nation's hardest-hit real-estate markets, convinced they can cherry-pick good deals amid broad price declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among these bargain buyers are affluent baby boomers eager to lock in low interest rates on retirement homes, high-end shoppers who had been waiting for prices to soften and serial investors determined not to miss the boat on a perceived opportunity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Brady, a retired publisher of Web sites and newsletters, was planning to buy a retirement home three years from now. But while vacationing in Key West, Fla., in January, he and his wife were stunned to see how far prices had fallen since their previous visit a year earlier. "Places were hundreds of thousands of dollars less," he says. The Connecticut couple paid $800,000 for a furnished two-bedroom condo that had been asking $1.75 million a year ago and was most recently listed at $850,000. "I think we got an incredible bargain," Mr. Brady says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales have slowed substantially while the number of houses on the market is rising in many localities, particularly those with a high proportion of second homes, such as Santa Fe, N.M., the Outer Banks of North Carolina, Cape Cod and Nantucket-Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts and California's Napa Valley. That suggests that many sellers are facing pressure to lower their asking prices further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices already have come down steeply in much of Florida, southern California, Phoenix and Las Vegas. With fourth-quarter mortgage foreclosures hitting a record high and delinquencies rising to a 23-year peak, according to a Mortgage Bankers Association report yesterday, there are few signs of a turnaround. Many housing-market economists don't expect U.S. home prices to stabilize until sometime next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many home shoppers say that's why they are taking their time. Last fall, Matthew Wilson, a private-equity executive, looked at two dozen Manhattan Beach homes in Los Angeles at prices ranging from $2 million to $3 million. "I saw so much inventory building up," Mr. Wilson says. One seller offered to throw in a Mercedes-Benz 500 along with a house priced at $2.4 million. In the end, Mr. Wilson came away thinking the properties he saw still were overpriced despite recent cuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wilson considered making a low-ball offer ("in the high ones") for a five-bedroom Craftsman-style house asking $2.6 million but was dissuaded by the seller's agent. The house is now listed at $2 million, he says. "Some day I may reoffer again, but I'm going to bid even lower than I was thinking last time," he says. "Unless I see my dream home . . . I think I have a 12-month window to pick my bid."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most deal hunters are avoiding markets with weak economies, such as Cleveland and Detroit, instead scouring places where the underlying economics are stronger. In Las Vegas and Miami, for example, real-estate problems are rooted in overbuilding; in California, tighter lending after the subprime mess has eliminated much of the potential buyer pool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And home prices haven't given up all the ground they gained in the decade-long boom. Despite huge recent declines, prices in Miami remain about 64% higher than they were in December 2002, according to Radar Logic, while in Los Angeles prices are 57% ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the real-estate run-up, amateur investors were flipping houses at a profit in as little as three months. Now, with the odds stacked against a quick turnaround, experts say investors should prepare to weather at least three to five years of ownership, budgeting for carrying costs that include taxes and maintenance. "I think to be an investor like this you've got to have a pretty strong stomach," says Jonathan Miller, chief executive of Miller Samuel, an appraisal firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jai Kreyl recently agreed to buy an 1,900-square-foot house in Summerlin, a master-planned community in Las Vegas. Ms. Kreyl, an executive assistant at a time-share company, was assisted by Joanne Stucky, an agent with Realty Executives of Nevada who has made a business out of finding cut-price properties. Similar houses were going for over $400,000 in 2005, the rough market peak in Vegas, but Ms. Kreyl is paying $270,000. "For 20 months I've been telling my friends I wanted to buy a $400,000 house for $250,000," she says. She acknowledges that prices may fall further but adds, "I'm still buying at a price I can afford. And I do believe that in three years' time, the market will just roll around."Real-estate brokers say the top sliver of the market nationwide -- houses priced at roughly $3 million or more -- remains firm. Still, some wealthy buyers are holding out for discounts. Bharat Desai and his wife, Neerja Sethi, co-founders of the technology-outsourcing firm Syntel, shopped for a year before buying last month an 8,900-square-foot oceanfront condo on Fisher Island, in Miami Beach, for $12.36 million. That was down from the $17.5 million the seller started out asking in January 2007, and below a $14 million offer the seller rejected in April, says Chris Bluntzer, a broker who handled the transaction with his wife, Elena. "My feeling," he says, "is that the smart money is stepping in."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Private Construction   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a long run of sustained growth, the value of private nonresidential construction contracted in January.

The value of private residential construction, meanwhile, continued to decline and totaled $455.8 billion in January, 3% below December's level.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE U.S. factory sector erased the tentative gains it made in January, sliding back into contraction and adding to uncertainty about its health. The Institute for Supply Management said its index of manufacturing activity fell to 48.3 in February from 50.7 in January. In the survey, 50 is the threshold between expansion and contraction, with numbers above the threshold signaling growth. Meanwhile, U.S. construction spending in January tumbled at the sharpest rate in 14 years, pulled down by the credit crunch and housing crisis. Total construction spending fell 1.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.121 trillion.   </p>

</div><div class="author">By Kelly Evans   </div><div>445 words</div><div>4 March 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A11</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. manufacturing activity declined last month to a five-year low, as slowing demand and rising prices continued to damp factory output.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management said its index of manufacturing activity, based on a survey of supply executives, dropped to 48.3 in February from 50.7 in January. Figures below 50 indicate a contraction. The December reading was 48.4.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said the nation's construction spending fell in January by the biggest margin in 14 years -- to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.121 trillion.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weakness that had been concentrated in housing is spreading to nonresidential construction. Spending on private nonresidential construction slumped by 1.2% in January -- the biggest drop in more than two years -- as evidence mounts that the housing-market downturn and credit crunch are crimping nonresidential projects.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The components of the ISM survey point to a weakening economy. New orders and employment continued to decline, while prices rose for the 14th month in a row. Growth in exports -- which have been keeping American manufacturers afloat as the economy slows -- continued, though at a slower rate.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, January's manufacturing index was stronger than the readings typically associated with recessions. In 2001, during the last recession, the index remained below 45 for nine months, said  <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> senior economist Peter Kretzmer. During the 1990-91 recession, the index dipped below 40 for two months.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Norbert J. Ore, chairman of the ISM survey, said he expects the manufacturing sector to fare comparatively well.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a weak dollar also fuels price increases in dollar-priced commodities, which are currently in high demand all over the world. Those rising prices are taking a slice out of U.S. manufacturers' profitability.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM report showed prices rose last month for 12 out of the 13 commodities tracked, including aluminum, copper, and natural gas.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"High commodity prices, especially for energy and metals, are starting to erode profit margins," said Thomas J. Duesterberg, president and chief executive of the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, a trade group in Arlington, Va.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">January's drop in construction spending was the largest since 1994. Spending on residential construction fell 2.9% from December and 19.4% from a year earlier.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending on private nonresidential construction slumped for the second month in a row. Lodging, transportation, communication and commercial-construction spending have all declined in recent months after surging earlier last year. Tighter credit conditions and falling property values could spell trouble for nonresidential-construction projects this year and next.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bad news mounted in the housing sector as the Commerce Department reported weak new-home sales and  <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers Inc.</span>, a large luxury-home builder, announced dismal first-quarter earnings.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales in January declined for the third month in a row, sinking to the slowest rate since early 1995, the Commerce Department reported. Toll reported a loss of $96 million, or 61 cents a share, for the quarter ended Jan. 31, saying "ceaseless talk" about a recession and falling prices were damping home-buyer confidence as the spring selling season kicked off.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This drumbeat, coupled with concerns over mortgages and foreclosures, has kept pent-up demand on the sidelines," Robert Toll, the builder's chief executive, said during a conference call yesterday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bad news came just one day after the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller national home-price index showed an 8.9% decline for the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier, the largest drop in its 20 years of data.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll's loss for the quarter was driven largely by its $153.3 million write-down of the value of its land inventory. The company earned $54.3 million, or 33 cents a share, in the first quarter of fiscal 2007.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Toll saw a glimmer of improvement in sales from a year ago in the markets of Naples, Fla., and Washington, D.C. But he warned that he didn't want to give the impression that "we're on the comeback trail," because many other markets remain weak.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the biggest challenges to builders is the glut of unsold vacant homes, which is driving down prices and weakening consumer confidence. Nationally, the inventory of new unsold homes fell to an estimated 482,000 homes at the end of January, down slightly from December, according to the Commerce Department. But, due to the slower sales rate, it would take 9.9 months to sell off the houses, up from 9.5 in December. The 9.9 months' supply is the largest in more than 26 years. A normal supply is five to six months.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new single-family homes decreased 2.8% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 588,000, the Commerce Department said. Sales tumbled 4% in December and 13.1% in November.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regionally, new-home sales decreased 2.4% in the South, 7.6% in the Midwest and 10.3% in the Northeast. Sales rose 2.2% in the West.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luxury home builder  <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers Inc.</span>, posting a large fiscal first-quarter loss on big write-downs of property values, said "ceaseless talk" about a recession is damping the mood of would-be home buyers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the U.S. Commerce Department said new-home sales took their third tumble in a row in January, sinking to the lowest point since early 1995. Sales of U.S. single-family homes decreased by 2.8% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 588,000, which was lower than economists were forecasting. Year over year, new-home sales were nearly 34% lower than the level in January 2007.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a new home fell 15% to $216,000 in January from $254,400 in January 2007, the Commerce Department said. The average price fell 12% to $276,600 from $314,600 a year earlier. Last December, the median price was $225,600 and the average was $274,700.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the first quarter ended Jan. 31,  <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> posted a loss of $96 million, or 61 cents a share, after $153.3 million in write-downs. It had profit of $54.3 million, or 33 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter. Revenue dropped 23% to $842.9 million, and its order backlog fell 42% to $2.4 billion. Excluding write-offs, it would have earned 35 cents a share during the quarter.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts polled by Thomson Financial expected a loss of 44 cents a share on revenue of $818 million.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Ceaseless talk of a recession continues to dampen the mood of consumers in general, whether or not a recession actually occurs," said Robert I. Toll, chairman and chief executive. "For home buyers, we believe this drumbeat, coupled with concerns over mortgages, the direction of home prices, and foreclosures, has kept pent-up demand on the sidelines."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll noted "glimmers of hope" in a few markets, including Naples, Florida, and suburban Washington, D.C.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-builder stocks including  <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> rallied sharply Tuesday after a report indicated U.S. home values fell 9% last year, raising hopes that improving affordability could lure reluctant buyers and help the housing market form a bottom. Toll rose nearly 5% to $24.26 at midday yesterday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its new-home sales report, the Commerce Department said inventories fell to an estimated 482,000 homes for sale at the end of January, down from December's 493,000. But, because of the decline in sales, the ratio of new houses for sale to houses sold rose in January to 9.9 from a revised 9.5 in December. Originally, the government estimated the December ratio at 9.6.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regionally last month, new-home sales in the U.S. decreased 2.4% in the South, 7.6% in the Midwest, and 10.3% in the Northeast. Sales rose 2.2% in the West.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An estimated 43,000 homes were sold in January, unchanged from December, based on figures not seasonally adjusted.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight's purchase-only index is based on more than five million repeat home-sale transactions. A Property Report article in some editions yesterday incorrectly said the index tracks average house-price changes in repeat sales or refinancings of single-family properties.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(WSJA Feb. 28, 2008)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two closely watched gauges of U.S. home prices showed broad-based declines in the prices of existing single-family homes, marking 2007 as a full year of declining home prices.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices in the fourth quarter fell 0.3% from a year earlier and declined 1.3% from the third quarter of 2007, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight said yesterday. That decline was much greater than the 0.3% decline from the second quarter to the third quarter of last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December alone, prices declined 0.2% across the U.S., on average, marking the sixth consecutive monthly decline, according to the U.S. agency's monthly data. Overall, prices have fallen 2.4% from an April 2007 peak, it said in its seasonally adjusted purchase-only house-price index. The index tracks average house-price changes in repeat sales or refinancings of the same single-family properties.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ofheo Director James Lockhart said 2007 "showed the first four-quarter decline in the purchase-only index since its earliest data in 1991."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, home prices in the fourth quarter were down 8.9% from a year earlier, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home-price indexes, released yesterday by credit-rating firm  <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's.</span> That was largest decline in the measure's 20-year history. The 10-city composite also set a new record, falling 9.8% in 2007; the 20-city index fell 9.1%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ofheo index relies on data collected by Fannie Mae and  <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, which Ofheo regulates, so it excludes loans too big for Fannie and Freddie to guarantee (those exceeding $417,000) or too shaky (the riskiest of the subprime). Case-Shiller includes those, but its data are limited to 100 major markets because it relies on the costly process of going to local property records for data.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Wherever you look, things look bleak, with 17 of the 20 metro areas reporting annual declines and the remaining three reporting flat or moderate growth rates," said Robert J. Shiller, professor at Yale University and chief economist at MacroMarkets LLC. Mr. Shiller added that 14 of the metro areas are also reporting record declines, with eight being in double-digit decline.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Miami remains the hardest hit of the major cities, posting an 18% annual decline. Las Vegas, Phoenix and San Diego all experienced price drops of 15%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charlotte, North Carolina, Portland, Oregon, and Seattle are the only three metro areas measured by the index still not seeing year-to-year price declines.   </p>

</div><div class="author">By Brian Blackstone and Jeff Bater   </div><div>695 words</div><div>21 February 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Asia</div><div>AWSJ</div><div>9</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2008 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. consumer-price inflation accelerated across the board last month, a worrisome sign for Federal Reserve officials who must balance a sharp slowdown in economic activity with stubbornly elevated price pressures.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, U.S. home construction rose in January, but the increase was slight, and building permits fell to the lowest point in 16 years, suggesting more pain ahead for the housing sector.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inflation data likely won't deter Fed officials from lowering interest rates again next month, because guarding against recessionary risks remains their top priority. But the figures could limit the size of future rate cuts as the Fed struggles to maintain the public's confidence that it will keep inflation under wraps.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consumer-price index rose 0.4% in January, the Labor Department said yesterday. The core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, advanced 0.3%. The data exceeded Wall Street forecasts.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer prices rose 4.3% on a year-to-year basis, matching the biggest increase since September 2005. The core CPI grew 2.5% compared with January 2007, the highest annual rate since last March. Over the past three months, core inflation has risen at a 3.1% annual rate. That is well above the top end of the Fed's presumed comfort zone of around 1.5% to 2%. The Fed's preferred gauge, the core price index for personal consumption expenditures, is closer to that range at a 2.2% annual increase through December.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid growing evidence that housing and credit strains are filtering through the broader economy, the Fed is widely expected to lower the federal-funds rate, at which banks lend to each other, by half a percentage point to 2.5% at next month's Federal Open Market Committee meeting. The CPI data should at a minimum slam the door on any hopes for a larger cut.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In congressional testimony last week, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said he expects sluggish economic growth ahead and moderating inflation. But the latter scenario may not unfold even if the economy slows. Import prices have soared in recent months, especially from China, once a source of cheap imports.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the Labor Department said the average weekly earnings of U.S. workers, adjusted for inflation, fell 0.5% in January, suggesting worker paychecks aren't keeping pace with inflation, which could in turn drag down spending. Average hourly earnings increased 0.2%, and average weekly hours were down 0.3%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, housing starts increased 0.8% in January to a seasonally adjusted 1.012 million annual rate, after plummeting 14.8% in December to 1.004 million, the Commerce Department said. Originally, the department reported December starts 14.2% lower at 1.006 million. Compared with a year earlier, January housing starts were down 27.9%. Building permits decreased 3% to a 1.048 million annual rate in January, the lowest since 984,000 in November 1991.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders are restrained by plunging sales. The latest government report on new-home sales in the U.S. showed demand in December tumbled 4.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 604,000, the lowest pace in 12 years. Compared with a year earlier, new-home sales were down 40.7%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report Tuesday showed builders gained a little confidence about the market this month -- yet still remain wary. The National Association of Home Builders' index for sales of new, single-family homes rose in February to 20 from 19 in January, yet far below a reading of 39 in February 2007. The index surveys builders about sales prospects now and in the near term.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With mortgage financing further constrained and inventories of unsold homes quite high, the near- to medium-term outlook for housing starts is not good," MFR Inc. analyst Joshua Shapiro said in reaction to the NAHB report. "The magnitude of the housing bubble was unprecedented, and the corrective process promises to be a long and painful one."   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts in the U.S. rose 0.8% in January, the first increase since October, thanks to a surge in construction of multifamily buildings, the Commerce Department said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of buildings with five or more units -- a volatile category -- jumped 17.6% during the month. But starts of new single-family homes dropped by 5.2% to an annualized rate of 743,000 homes, 33.8% below the January 2007 level. New building permits -- a gauge of future building activity -- dropped 3% overall in January from the previous month, marking a ninth straight month of decline.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A huge increase in new construction in the Northeast -- which was the first region to suffer as the housing market began to decline -- may have been due to unusually warm temperatures there last month.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- Manhattan's luxury real-estate market may feel an unusual chill from the Wall Street crowd this spring, but foreign buyers are offering some comfort.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street's 2007 bonuses didn't shrink as much as some of the dire predictions suggested -- overall, they were down only about 5% -- but at companies such as  <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.</span>, a greater percentage of these bonuses was paid in stock rather than cash. Combined with the continued housing meltdown, credit mess and recession fears, luxury-real-estate agents have noticed a lot more caution among buyers using Wall Street bonus money. However, the wariness of Wall Street is being offset by growing interest from foreign buyers who see New York luxury real estate as a bargain now, especially in light of the weak dollar.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's caution versus eagerness, when comparing Wall Street buyers to foreign buyers," said Ivana Tagliamonte, senior vice president at Halstead Property in New York. She said foreigners probably account for 50% of condo showings these days, a figure that was closer to 10% two years ago.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elizabeth Lee Sample and Brenda Powers, brokers at Brown Harris Stevens, agreed, saying three out of five prospective buyers are foreign, up from one out of five buyers a year ago. "Foreign buyers are more than picking up the slack of the American buyer, without question," Ms. Sample said. "There's a huge demand from foreign buyers right now, more so than last year, and that's making up for Wall Street hesitancy."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The usually eager Wall Street crowd has taken a step back this year and, while Wall Streeters are still buying luxury real estate, they are "shopping carefully," said John Burger, senior vice president and managing director of Brown Harris Stevens. "People may not feel as liquid after their 2007 bonus as they did after their 2006 bonus," he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to data from Brown Harris Stevens, the number of luxury sales, involving properties priced at $5 million or more, rose 20% for the first six months of 2007. "At that end of the market, some of that has to be attributed to Wall Street bonuses," said Gregory Heym, executive vice president and chief economist at Terra Holdings LLC, a privately held real-estate company.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Louise Phillips Forbes, executive vice president of Halstead Property, said she has noticed a cautiousness among buyers spending around $2 million. However, "there's 30% more buyers because of Europe," she said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Louise Sunshine, developer director of Alexico Group, a real-estate development company in New York, agreed. "People are much more conscious of what they are paying for," she said. "Last year they were over-the-top in terms of luxury. This year it's not quite as frivolous."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For 2008, it is back to basics and, in real estate, that means space, location and lighting, according to Mr. Burger. "These are the fundamentals that you can't change, and they are crucial at the top of requirements," he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers with whom Ms. Sunshine worked "are looking for more at-home amenities." She cited sales at the Laurel condominium on the Upper East Side, a building that includes a triathlon training center, family lounge, game room, arcade, computer room and library. She explained that, for families living at places such as the Laurel, "the public spaces of the building are extensions of their home space," and they want to make sure they have top-notch amenities if they are paying top dollar.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But despite the desire to have more space or a better location, market turmoil is causing some buyers to hold on to their properties a little longer. For example, some buyers with whom Ms. Forbes is working decided to put off making a real-estate decision. "They're deciding to wait six months," she said. "Or if they're bidding on something, they're just giving the asking price."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Tagliamonte said that when the stock market fell last month, two purchasers withdrew offers. "One tried to renegotiate the price for about 10% less than what they were expected to pay," she said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Complicating the situation is the shortage of luxury properties on the market. According to Jacky Teplitzky, a managing director at Prudential Douglas Elliman in New York, the number of luxury apartments (including co-ops and condominiums) for sale fell 35% to 887 units for the fourth quarter of 2007 compared with the fourth quarter of 2006.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Forbes said there has always been a scarcity of luxury apartments above the $5 million mark, and Ms. Teplitzky said one reason for the shortage of Park Avenue and Fifth Avenue apartments "is that people are staying put because they want to see how this situation will play out."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agents said that, despite the uncertainty of the financial markets, they are still making deals, citing the condominiums at the Laurel, 15 Central Park West and the New York Plaza at Fifth Avenue and Central Park as locations of interest.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Clearly, 2007 was the year the Manhattan residential real-estate market hit its peak levels across the board," said Mr. Burger. "In 2008, the sentiment is that there'll be a certain leveling off."   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to its 20-city survey of home prices, Standard &amp; Poor's/Case-Shiller publishes a national home-price index based on data from more than 100 metropolitan areas. Yesterday's Capital column incorrectly said the data are limited to 20 major markets.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(WSJ February 15, 2008)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Predicting how much worse the U.S. housing market will get is tough. The future is never certain. But when it comes to home prices, getting a clear picture of the recent past turns out to be surprisingly hard as well.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's confusing to homeowners, who fret about the value of what for many is their single largest asset. There is a huge psychological difference between a slower climb in the value of one's house and an outright decline -- and, as a result, a difference in the political reaction.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tracking home prices is harder than tracking the price of stocks, which are traded constantly in public view on exchanges. And it's harder than tracking the price of toothpaste. That just involves sampling posted prices on grocery-store shelves and Web sites.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two best -- though far from perfect -- measures of housing prices are the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight's index and the gloomier  <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case/Shiller index. Both are based on a concept, developed in the 1980s by Karl Case of Wellesley College and Robert Shiller of Yale University, that looks at repeat sales of the same houses.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ofheo's index says home prices rose nationally by 1.8% between the third quarters of 2006 and 2007. But the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller national index of home prices was down 4.5% in the same period. The Ofheo index showed a 2.16% increase in house prices in Chicago; the Case-Shiller index showed a decline of 2.48%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those discrepancies persist even though both barometers avoid distortions that occur in other widely cited measures -- such as the National Association of Realtors' median home price -- that reflect the mix of homes actually sold in a given month as well as the change in prices. Such measures rise in months when a lot of high-end houses are sold and fall at times when a lot of low-end houses are sold.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors' measure fell 6% in 2007. The group says the index was pulled down by a drop in the number of high-end home sales, which have been hurt by disruptions in the market for mortgages exceeding $417,000, the maximum mortgage giants Fannie Mae and  <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> are allowed to guarantee.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big picture here is clear: House prices rose rapidly in the early years of this decade. They have stopped rising in many places. And, in many markets, they are now falling. (Even Ofheo's index showed a quarterly decline at the end of 2007.) And prices don't appear to have touched bottom yet. But Charles Calomiris, a Columbia University economist, says, "Too much weight is being attached to the Case-Shiller index. . . . Housing prices may not be falling as much as some economists say they are."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With house prices so central to the economy right now, there is intense public (as well as scholarly) interest in why these two carefully constructed measures differ.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ofheo gets a steady stream of inquiries from ordinary homeowners trying to figure out what's happening to the price of their houses, and offers an online calculator to make estimates. Ofheo's quarterly numbers -- to be released monthly beginning in March -- go into the Federal Reserve's estimates of household wealth. Case/Shiller is increasingly prominent and is the basis for future contracts that allow investors to bet on the price of houses.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are a couple of very big differences. The Ofheo index relies on data collected by Fannie Mae and  <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, which Ofheo regulates, so it excludes loans too big for Fannie and Freddie to guarantee (those exceeding $417,000) or too shaky (the riskiest of the subprime). Case/Shiller includes those, but its data are limited to 20 major markets because it relies on the costly process of going to local property records for data. One of Mr. Calomiris's complaints is that house prices in these markets may be doing worse than those in other places.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent dissection of the two indexes in 10 metropolitan areas by Ofheo economist Andrew Leventis, posted on the agency's Web site, sheds some light on other differences. Part of the discrepancy is technical, such as different approaches to adjusting data when there's a long interval between repeat sales of a house.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But puzzles remain. It turns out, for instance, that prices of low- and moderate-priced homes with mortgages that aren't guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie are falling particularly sharply, buoying the Ofheo index -- even though that index includes plenty of other of low- and moderately priced homes in the same neighborhoods.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, by the time the experts get the measures perfected, we'll be onto a bubble in some other asset market.   </p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty   </div><div>422 words</div><div>8 February 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of homes available for sale in most major metropolitan areas rose only slightly in January, a month when for-sale signs usually sprout in greater numbers after the holiday lull.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total listings of homes in 29 metro areas at the end of last month were up 1.1% from a month earlier, according to figures compiled by ZipRealty Inc., a real-estate-brokerage firm based in Emeryville, Calif. The data cover all listings of single-family homes, condos and town houses on local multiple-listing services in those areas, where Zip operates.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Listings normally rise about 5% in January from December, said Thomas Lawler, a housing economist in Leesburg, Va. The lack of a big January rise this year suggests that people who don't need to sell their homes are taking them off the market because "conditions are so lousy," Mr. Lawler said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners are competing with aggressively priced properties from builders and lenders that have acquired homes through foreclosure. Mr. Lawler said about 40% of home sales in California in last year's fourth quarter involved foreclosed properties.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the small January increase, there are still plenty of homes available, and sales remain sluggish. Inventory was up 20% from January 2007 in 18 metro areas for which Zip has comparable year-earlier data.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said yesterday that its pending-home-sales index in December declined 1.5% from a month earlier to 85.9. A sale is considered pending when a contract has been signed but the transaction hasn't been completed. The index equates the 2001 level of activity to 100.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many housing economists expect home prices to continue falling in much of the country at least through the end of this year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Metro areas with the largest January increases in listings included Tucson, Ariz. (up 5.2%); Phoenix (3.4%); and Seattle (3.2%), ZipRealty found.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ZipRealty doesn't provide data on the New York borough of Manhattan. But Jonathan Miller, director of research at Radar Logic Inc., a real-estate-information provider, says the number of homes listed for sale in Manhattan at the end of January was 5,926, up 9.4% from a month earlier. Mr. Miller said the Manhattan inventory remains fairly lean but some potential buyers may be taking their time because of uncertainty about the market's direction in light of Wall Street job losses.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luxury-home builder <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers Inc.</span>, reporting that its first-quarter home-construction revenue fell 22% from a year earlier, said it doesn't see any end in sight to the U.S. housing market's woes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Based on current traffic and deposits, we are not yet seeing much light at the end of the tunnel," said Robert Toll, chairman and chief executive officer. "Buyers seem to be hiding. The market's problem is a lack of confidence, not just regarding the direction of home prices, but . . . the overall economy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Horsham, Pa., company said its home-building revenue skidded to $842.7 million in the quarter, compared with $1.09 billion a year ago, a preliminary report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another sign of the market's weakness, Toll said its backlog fell to $2.4 billion, down 42% from the first quarter of fiscal 2007, as the number of signed contracts on homes fell 46% from last year. In addition, the average price of a house sold by Toll fell, while the average price of canceled houses rose. Net signed contracts -- a sign of future activity -- were cut in half to $375.3 million. In the quarter, 257 contracts valued at $198 million were canceled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With conditions still weak in most markets, we expect to continue to face challenging times ahead," said Joel Rassman, Toll's chief financial officer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rassman said Toll estimates that write-downs for the latest quarter ended Jan. 31 will be between $150 million and $300 million before taxes. The company will report first-quarter financial results Feb. 27.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll's outlook comes a day after analyst Daniel Oppenheim at Banc of America Securities upgraded the company's shares to "neutral" from "sell," saying he had a more positive stance on home-building stocks because of improving affordability, reduced construction and less risk as adjustable-rate mortgages reset because of lower interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> were down 74 cents, or 3.4%, to $21.13 yesterday in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sidney Sheldon's   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Widow Lists Compound   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The widow of author Sidney Sheldon has listed their Palm Springs, Calif., compound for $7.9 million, plus a house across the street for $4 million. The Oscar-winning screenwriter, best-selling novelist and creator of TV's "I Dream of Jeannie" died a year ago this week at the age of 89.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sheldon and his wife, Alexandra, owned a total of four houses in the Old Las Palmas neighborhood. Three adjacent houses, on two acres, measure a combined 18,000 interior square feet. The Sheldons lived in a midcentury modernist seven-bedroom home bought in 1977 and also owned a six-bedroom Mediterranean-style guest house. A four-bedroom home used for entertaining with a glass-enclosed indoor pool and a poolside kitchen can be bought separately for $1.45 million. The compound has two other pools.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 5,800-square-foot home across the street, on 0.8 acre, also has a pool. Brook Ashley, Scott Palermo and Jim Sanak, all of  <span class="companylink">Prudential California Realty</span>'s Estates division, have the listings.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sheldon won his Oscar for the 1947 comedy "The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer," and his bestsellers include "The Other Side of Midnight."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan Price Cuts   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(And Signs of Strength)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a rare sign of weakness in Manhattan's ultra-high-end real-estate market, owners have cut the price of two apartments at New York's Plaza condominium, the redesigned Plaza Hotel.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fred Farago, the president of a fruit-flavoring company, is now asking $5.9 million for a 1,200-square-foot one-bedroom apartment there, roughly the same amount he paid for the 15th-floor unit in July and 13% lower than his original $6.8 million asking price. Meanwhile, Italian-born architect Teresa Sapey trimmed $200,000 off the initial $10 million price tag for her 13th-floor unit, bought for $6.9 million, also in July. Stribling's Plaza Resales &amp; Rentals has both listings. The redesigned Plaza set records for Manhattan real estate. In June, developer Harry Macklowe paid nearly $60 million for an apartment there.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, Manhattan real estate remains strong. At 15 Central Park West, Evan Cole -- who co-founded  <span class="companylink">ABC Carpet &amp; Home</span>, a well-known Manhattan furnishings retailer -- has agreed to sell his 15th-floor three-bedroom apartment there for over $9 million. He paid $4.83 million. One floor below, Michael Holtz, a travel-agency owner, recently signed an agreement to sell an identical apartment for more than his $8.5 million asking price. Both apartments measure 2,250 square feet and have partial views of Central Park. Corcoran's Jon Capobianco and Lauren Muss had both listings. Their colleague Rica Tarnoff, was a co-listing agent for Mr. Holtz's apartment.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, hedge-fund executive Scott A. Bommer paid $46 million for a Fifth Avenue duplex, a record for cooperative apartments.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rupert Everett Offers   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Miami Beach Condo   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actor Rupert Everett has listed his Miami Beach pied-a-terre for $1.15 million.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The British-born performer, who voices Prince Charming in the "Shrek" sequels and starred in the comedies "My Best Friend's Wedding" and "An Ideal Husband," paid $670,000 for the two-bedroom, two-bath condo in 2004.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Ocean Drive in South Beach, within walking distance of the area's restaurants and nightclubs, the 1,350-square-foot apartment, on the seventh floor, has an ocean view, a 500-square-foot balcony and terrazzo floors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Everett, 48, renovated the kitchen and bathrooms. The actor, who also owns homes in London, Paris and New York, is selling because he's spending more time in Europe, according to Michael Valdes, of Sol  <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>, who shares the listing with his colleague Jorge Uribe.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Miami's real-estate market has tumbled. In December, the median price of a condo in Miami-Dade County dropped 10% from a year earlier, according to the Florida Association of Realtors.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some Cap Rates Inch Up   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Capitalization rates, which reached historic lows last year, have started to inch up for apartment buildings and office properties. The capitalization rate is a calculation of rental income in the first year of ownership, divided by the purchase price. In December, average cap rates for apartment buildings were 6.1%, up slightly from 6.09% in November. For central-business-district office properties, average cap rates rose to 5.87% in December, up from 5.76% in November.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes declined 4.7% in December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 604,000, the worst showing since 559,000 in February 1995, the Commerce Department said. Home sales fell 13% in November to a 634,000 pace.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An estimated 495,000 new homes were for sale at the end of December, down from November's 502,000. But at the current sales pace, it would take 9.6 months to sell the homes. In November, inventories represented 9.4 months of sales.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Existing-home sales in the U.S. resumed tumbling in December, and the median price dropped.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home resales fell to a 4.89 million annualized rate, a 2.2% decrease from November's unrevised pace of five million, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. For 2007, existing-home sales tumbled 13% to 5,652,000, the association said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home price was $208,400 in December, down 6% from $221,600 in December 2006. The median price in November was $208,700. For 2007, the median price fell 1.4% to $218,900.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, an economist with the realtors' group, said the market is suffering "uncharacteristic weakness."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home sales remain weak despite improved affordability conditions in many parts of the country," Mr. Yun said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage carried a 6.1% rate in December, down from 6.21% in November, according to  <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac.</span></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories of homes fell 7.4% at the end of December to 3.91 million, which represented a 9.6-month supply at the current sales pace. There was a 10.1-month supply at the end of November, revised from a previous estimate of 10.3 months.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regionally, existing-home sales fell 1.7% in the Midwest, 4.6% in the Northeast, 2.1% in the West and 1% in the South.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of U.S. workers filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week for a fourth-straight week, suggesting that a resilient labor market might keep the U.S. economy from sliding into recession.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial claims for jobless benefits fell 1,000 to 301,000 after seasonal adjustments in the week ended Jan. 19, the Labor Department said Thursday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four-week average of new claims, which economists use to smooth out weekly volatility, tumbled 14,000 to 314,750, the lowest level since Oct. 6. Claims for the week ended Jan. 12 were revised up 1,000 to 302,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of workers drawing unemployment benefits for more than one week fell 75,000 to 2,672,000 in the week ended Jan. 12. That is the biggest weekly decline since May 5.   </p>

</div><div class="author">A WSJ News Roundup   </div><div>548 words</div><div>25 January 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lennar Corp.</span>, one of the nation's biggest home builders, posted a massive quarterly loss of $1.25 billion as it wrote down the value of land holdings and suffered from slumping sales and softer home prices.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Miami-based company said it was girding for tough times to continue. "As we look ahead to 2008, we are not expecting market conditions to improve, and perhaps might continue to decline in the near term," said President and Chief Executive Stuart Miller. "Nevertheless, the strength of our balance sheet, bolstered by the cash generated through our fourth-quarter strategic moves, will keep us well positioned to weather these turbulent times."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market -- ground zero of the credit crunch -- has yet to register anything close to a recovery. Builders continue to cut inventory prices. Although interest rates have come down, many consumers are unable to secure funding -- and others are worried about deteriorating value. Traffic has slowed to a trickle and cancellation rates remain high.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said yesterday that sales of single-family homes and condominiums fell again in December, ending a year in which sales of single-family homes plunged by the largest amount in a quarter century.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trade group said existing-home sales fell to a 4.89 million annual rate in December, down 2.2% on the month. For 2007, existing-home sales tumbled 12.8% to 5.652 million. Inventories also dropped, down 7.4%, but, at 3.91 million, supply remains high. The median home price was $208,400 in December, down 6% from $221,600 in December 2006.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Laurence Yun, an NAR economist, said conditions in housing could begin to turn around with Congress's economic-stimulus package, which is expected to raise the conforming loan limits for Fannie Mae and  <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the government-sponsored mortgage agencies, beyond the current $417,000. The higher limits would allow the companies to buy bigger loans in areas with high housing costs.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lennar's loss for the fourth quarter ended Nov. 30, which worked out to $7.92 a share, was wider than the fiscal third-quarter net loss of $513.9 million, a then-record for the 53-year-old company. Revenue dropped 49%. The company didn't provide earnings guidance for 2008.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors, who had expected a large loss, bid up Lennar shares. The stock rose $1.27, or 8.5%, to $16.21 in 4 p.m. composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lennar's results included, among other write-offs, $970.1 million in valuation adjustments. In November Lennar announced a "strategic land investment venture" with  <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley Real Estate</span>, selling about 11,000 home sites in 32 communities, including raw land and partially developed sites, for $525 million, nearly 60% below the $1.3 billion book value.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company's new home orders fell 51% to 4,761, with a cancellation rate of 33%. The average sales price fell 3.7% to $291,000. Mr. Miller said Lennar has generated cash by reducing inventory through price cuts and offering bigger incentives.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lennar cut its work force by 35% in 2007.   </p>

</p><div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Housing Slump Starts to Hit Stronger Cities --- Supply Grows, Prices Weaken In Northwest, North Carolina; Manhattan Looks Vulnerable   </span>
</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty   </div><div>1422 words</div><div>24 January 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's getting harder to hide from the housing bust.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tight credit, fragile consumer confidence and a weakening economy are slowing sales and depressing prices even in some places -- such as the Pacific Northwest and North Carolina -- that until recently had avoided the housing slump afflicting most of the country.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even Manhattan, where prices continued to rise briskly last year, looks more vulnerable to a slowdown. Falling home prices and soaring defaults elsewhere have created more than $100 billion of losses on mortgage-related securities at Wall Street firms, destroying many jobs in the New York area. The number of homes listed for sale in Long Island and Queens at the end of 2007 was enough to last 18 months at the current sales rate, up from a 12-month supply a year before.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local markets still vary hugely around the country, according to The Wall Street Journal's quarterly survey of housing data in 28 major metropolitan areas. Inventories of unsold homes are enormous in much of Florida, Phoenix, Las Vegas and the Detroit area. But the number of homes listed for sale declined last year in Boston and Denver, and they were flat in Dallas.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few expect a quick recovery. Stricter credit policies at mortgage lenders have disqualified many potential buyers, and foreclosures are adding to an already glutted supply in many areas. In California, notices of default filed by lenders in the fourth quarter totaled 81,550, more than double the 37,994 filed in the year-earlier period, according to  <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> Information Systems, a research firm in La Jolla, Calif. Meanwhile, builders caught with too much inventory are slashing prices.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All those factors create "a lot of indigestion, and I think it's going to take all of this year to work its way out," says Ronald Peltier, chief executive of  <span class="companylink">HomeServices of America Inc.</span> in Minneapolis, which owns brokerages in 19 states. He expects the market to begin slowly improving in 2009.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, people trying to sell homes "don't seem to have a prayer" in competing with lenders offering foreclosed homes and builders dumping excess inventory, says Don Schriver, owner of Assist-2-Sell Good Sense Realty in Buckeye, Ariz., a suburb of Phoenix. He points to a four-bedroom house in Buckeye that was built in 2005 and sold in August 2006 for $775,000. After a lender acquired the home through foreclosure last year, it sold again in December for $380,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In California's Orange County, around a quarter of the listings are either foreclosed properties owned by lenders or homes owned by people trying to do "short sales," or sell for less than the amount they owe the bank, says Steven Thomas, president of Re/Max Real Estate Services in Aliso Viejo, Calif. Short sales require approval from the lenders, often a lengthy process.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Karsten, a plumber who rents a small house in the Los Angeles area, is typical of today's wary home shopper. He has been going to open houses and looking into possible bargains on foreclosed homes. But he aims to make a down payment of more than 10% and get a fixed-rate loan. And he won't jump at the first decent house he finds.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm in no hurry," Mr. Karsten says. "The longer I wait, the more money I save."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With buyers on the fence, sales are stalled. December sales in the San Francisco Bay area and in Southern California were the slowest in at least two decades, according to  <span class="companylink">DataQuick.</span></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> says sales have dried up partly because of relatively high rates on "jumbo" mortgages, those over the $417,000 limit on loans that can be guaranteed by government-sponsored investors Fannie Mae and  <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac.</span> Rattled by defaults, investors are shying away from jumbo loans. The resulting higher costs for these large loans are pinching sales in California and other high-price areas. Home sales in the Bay Area financed with jumbo loans were down 66% in December from a year before, according to  <span class="companylink">DataQuick.</span></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the fastest increases in home listings have occurred in relatively strong markets. The inventory in the Seattle metro area counties of King, Snohomish and Pierce leapt 50% last year. At the end of December, when listings are lower than usual because of the holidays, the inventory there was enough to last 4.9 months, denoting a fairly balanced market -- but up from a very lean 2.7 months at the end of 2006. In King County, the median price in December was down 2.6% from a year ago.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the rise in supply, home prices in Seattle probably will fall further, says Glenn Kelman, chief executive of Redfin, a real-estate broker based there. "If you walk around town, you see cranes everywhere," he says.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Portland, Ore., another fairly buoyant market, the inventory at year end was 5.7 months, up from 3.7 months a year earlier, and the median price fell 4%. In Charlotte, N.C., the supply grew to 7.8 months from 5.9 months.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Listings in the eight-county San Francisco area surged 42% last year, but there are big differences in price trends, depending on location. In December,  <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> reports, the median price was down 22% from a year before in outlying Sonoma County but just 1.9% lower in San Francisco and virtually unchanged in Santa Clara County, home to many thriving technology companies.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan so far has dodged the housing slump, but it may not escape completely unscathed. The median price of condominiums and cooperative apartments sold in the fourth quarter was about $850,000, up 6.4% from a year earlier, according to Jonathan Miller, research director at Radar Logic Inc., a research firm. (In the luxury end of the market, the median price jumped 28% to $4.3 million.) The inventory of co-ops at the end of 2007 was down 26% from a year earlier, while the supply of condos was unchanged.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, though, the housing slump that afflicts most of the country is creating huge losses at some Wall Street firms that gambled on mortgage securities. That means more job cuts and smaller bonuses this year. On the plus side, the weak dollar continues to bring in foreign buyers. Mr. Miller sees "very modest" price increases this year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Dean Baker, an economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington who has been bearish on housing for years, says Wall Street's woes make New York's real-estate market look "quite vulnerable."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Job growth in the next two years is likely to be very weak in the New York metro area, where financial services account for about a quarter of income earned, says Mark Zandi, chief economist at  <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com. "Wall Street is unraveling and taking the economy with it," he says.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Miami-Dade County, there was a 37-month supply of condos listed for sale at year end, according to figures compiled by Esslinger-Wooten-Maxwell, a big local real-estate broker. But that excludes "for sale by owner" units that aren't listed, as well as about 19,000 units due to be completed this year, says Jack McCabe, a real-estate consultant in Deerfield Beach, Fla., who says he advises investors who hope eventually to find bargains in the area. He notes that foreclosures will add to the supply and predicts that 2008 will be "the year of the great condo meltdown."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monica Harvey, a real-estate agent for Esslinger-Wooten-Maxwell in Miami Beach, says sales have slowed so much that she can work out at her gym more often and even drive to the airport to meet potential buyers. Ms. Harvey is encouraged, though, by the flow of buyers from Europe and Latin America, taking advantage of a weaker U.S. dollar. Already a Spanish speaker, she's thinking of studying Mandarin. "I'm waiting for the Chinese," she says. "I know they're going to come at some point."   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Home construction in the U.S. plunged in December to its lowest point in more than 16 years, and an indicator of future groundbreakings also dropped sharply.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts sank 14% to a seasonally adjusted 1.006 million annual rate, after falling 7.9% in November to 1.173 million, the Commerce Department said Thursday. Originally, Commerce reported November starts 3.7% lower at 1.187 million.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big decline surprised Wall Street. The median forecast of economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires was a 5% drop to a 1.13 million annual rate. December's level of 1.006 million was the lowest since 996,000 in May 1991.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Year over year, housing starts during December were 38.2% below the level of construction in December 2006.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The level of starts for all of 2007, in numbers not seasonally adjusted, was 1.354 million, 24.8% below 2006's 1.801 million. The Full-year drop was the largest since a 26% fall in 1980.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders have been pulling back because sales for new homes have plunged while the supply of unsold homes hovers at a high level. The latest government report on new-home sales in the U.S., covering November, showed a 9% decline to an annual rate of 647,000, down 34.4% from November 2006.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Illustrating how low builders feel, an industry gauge, the National Association of Home Builders' Housing Market Index, sits in a narrow range of pessimism. The index measures the confidence of builders. On Wednesday, the NAHB released the January index; it rose to 19, up just a point from a historic low 18 in December.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The magnitude of the housing bubble was unprecedented, and the corrective process promises to be a long and painful one," MFR Inc. chief U.S. economist Joshua Shapiro said in reaction to the NAHB report.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Home construction in the U.S. plunged in December to its lowest point in more than 16 years, and an indicator of future groundbreakings also dropped sharply.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts sank 14% to a seasonally adjusted 1.006 million annual rate, after falling 7.9% in November to 1.173 million, the U.S. Commerce Department said Thursday. Originally, Commerce reported November starts 3.7% lower at 1.187 million.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big decline surprised Wall Street. The median forecast of economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires was a 5% drop to a 1.13 million annual rate. December's level of 1.006 million was the lowest since 996,000 in May 1991.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Year over year, housing starts during December were 38.2% below the level of construction in December 2006.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The level of starts for all of 2007, in numbers not seasonally adjusted, was 1.354 million, 24.8% below 2006's 1.801 million. The full-year drop was the largest since a 26% fall in 1980.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders have been pulling back because sales for new homes have plunged while the supply of unsold homes hovers at a high level. The latest government report on new-home sales in the U.S., covering November, showed a 9% decline to an annual rate of 647,000, down 34.4% from November 2006.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Illustrating how low builders feel, an industry gauge, the National Association of Home Builders' Housing Market Index, sits in a narrow range of pessimism. The index measures the confidence of builders. On Wednesday, the NAHB released the January index; it rose to 19, up just a point from a historic low of 18 in December.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The magnitude of the housing bubble was unprecedented, and the corrective process promises to be a long and painful one," MFR Inc. chief U.S. economist Joshua Shapiro said in reaction to the NAHB report. "Hence, it is hardly surprising that builder sentiment remains as low as it has ever been."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A key indicator in Thursday's data suggested an even lower level of groundbreakings in the future. Building permits decreased 8.1% to a 1.068 million annual rate in December. Economists had expected permits to drop 2.6% to a rate of 1.13 million. November permits fell 0.7% to 1.162 million.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The builder Miller &amp; Smith is based in McLean, Va. The company's location was incorrectly given as McClean in a Leading the News article Friday about home construction activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(WSJ Jan. 23, 2008)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home construction plunged last month to its lowest level in 16 years, as builders cut back and their lenders grew wary amid rising delinquent construction loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts plunged 14.2% in December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.006 million, the slowest pace since 996,000 starts in May 1991. Permits, an indicator of future construction, tumbled 8.1% to a 1.068 million pace, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While builders have been scaling back for many months, some said the end of 2007 was the bleakest period yet in the slump, forcing them to make sharp cutbacks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The last quarter was the most challenging environment since the downturn started in July 2005," said Douglas Smith, president of Miller &amp; Smith, a builder in McClean, Va., which sold 350 homes last year. "All of the ramifications from the mortgage meltdown really took hold."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Smith said many buyers walked away from homes that had been started because they couldn't obtain financing. That left him with standing inventory to sell. "The mortgage crisis has really educated builders," he said. "We are all recognizing that we need to get supply in line."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time that banks are tightening mortgage lending to home buyers, some are also scaling back construction loans to builders. As construction-loan delinquencies mount and more small to medium-size home builders veer toward bankruptcy, lenders are tightening credit for new developments. One large lender, <span class="companylink">IndyMac Bancorp Inc.</span>, said it funded no new home-builder loan commitments in November or December, "as we continue to focus our efforts in this division on workouts."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Many builders are not only realizing that they need to cut back, they are being told they have no choice," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such tightening may help explain the drop-off in permits, as builders plan fewer developments and slash their labor forces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Hovnanian Enterprises Inc.</span>, the large Red Bank, N.J., builder, has cut the number of unsold homes, or "spec homes," that it has started by 23% since July. Builders typically build a sizable number of spec homes to offer to buyers who need to move into a home quickly. Hovnanian, like many builders, is being cautious about starting such homes because it needs to conserve cash to pay down its debt. "You don't want to tie up that cash in unsold vertical construction," said Larry Sorsby, Hovnanian's chief financial officer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest drop in construction starts last month were among multifamily units, which plunged 40%, while single-family home starts fell 2.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, testifying before the House Budget Committee, said housing will probably subtract more than one percentage point from the nation's economic growth in the fourth quarter, and "may continue to be a drag on growth for a good part of this year as well."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists agreed that the weaker-than-expected housing report was worrisome. "Housing's contribution to economic growth will be substantially negative" again, in both the fourth quarter of 2007 and the first quarter of this year," said Insight Economics analyst Steven Wood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> economist Michelle Meyer said the housing data suggest that gross domestic product grew at a slim 1% annual rate in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, a report issued by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia yesterday showed that the manufacturing activity in the mid-Atlantic region contracted sharply in January, reflecting a steep drop in orders. It was the worst reading since October 2001.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Labor Department said the number of workers filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week to its lowest level in nearly four months. Initial jobless claims fell 21,000 to 301,000. The four-week average of new claims, which economists use to smooth out weekly volatility, decreased 11,750 to 328,500.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's one bright side to the housing crisis: some lower rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The regions hardest hit by the housing downturn have seen ailing builders, rising foreclosure rates and a glut of unsold homes, amid other signs of distress. But there are also stories like Laura Evans's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 38-year-old elementary-school teacher moved to Stuart, Fla., from Orlando with her husband and baby last fall. Looking for a rental apartment, they were pleasantly surprised: There were plenty of choices at lower-than-expected prices, thanks to the multitude of owners trying to rent units they couldn't sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When we got down here, we shopped and shopped around," says Ms. Evans, who rented a new 2,200-square-foot, three-bedroom townhouse with a pool and a playground for $1,150 per month. The owners allowed the couple to move in with their dog, despite a prohibition against pets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, rents have continued to rise steadily in many markets. And the housing downturn means that more people are looking for rentals as well, increasing demand. Many would-be buyers have become renters because they can't get a mortgage in today's tight credit environment, or because they're sitting tight in hopes that prices drop further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the regions hit hardest by the subprime crisis, finding a rental apartment is easier and, in some cases, cheaper than it was before the crunch. Some homeowners forced out by foreclosure are finding rental deals that are at "discounts of 50% to 70% off what they were paying on their mortgages," says Brenda F. Gerdes, who owns Management Specialists Inc. in Port St. Lucie, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vacancies have risen in 29 markets in the fourth quarter of 2007, including Las Vegas, Palm Beach, Memphis, Orange County, Calif., and Orlando, according to <span class="companylink">Reis Inc.</span>, a New York real-estate research firm. Ron Witten, a Dallas-based housing analyst, estimates there are 760,000 vacant condos and homes for sale nationwide beyond what the market could normally carry, in addition to a surplus of 350,000 vacant rental properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Behind the trend are tens of thousands of unsold condominium units that are being dumped on markets such as South Florida, Las Vegas and Phoenix. While thousands of single-family homes also are coming on the market, renters prefer condos to houses, which typically have more expensive upkeep. "Tenants have to pick up more of the bills," says Artur Ciesielski, a Phoenix real-estate agent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 4,200 units have been pulled out of the for-sale condo market and put into the rental pool in Florida's Palm Beach County alone, according to Mary Grace Breeding, president of McCabe Research &amp; Consulting in Deerfield Beach. Those units include the 216-unit Aventine at Boynton Beach and the 450-unit Mizner Court at Broken Sound in Boca Raton, where rents range from $975 to $2,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor are so-called condo reversions limited to the Sunbelt. In Brooklyn, N.Y., two luxury condo developments converted to rental apartments last spring, including 99 Gold Street, which had begun accepting sales contracts less than a year earlier. Rentals at the 88-unit building range from $2,000 a month for 700-square-foot studios to $5,500 for two-bedroom penthouses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even healthy markets are beginning to feel downward pressure on rents. A disappointing employment report earlier this month and other signs of a possible recession don't bode well for landlords, since people who lose their jobs will resist paying higher rents or will move in with friends or family. Many displaced homeowners forced out by foreclosures also are doubling up, says Mark Obrinsky, chief economist at the National Multi-Housing Council.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means that landlords are seeing what should be one of their strongest markets in years weakened by the increasing supply of unsold properties entering the rental market. "Shadow inventory is coming out and competing against us for rentals," says Richard Campo, chief executive of <span class="companylink">Camden Property Trust</span>, a Houston-based real-estate company that owns 70,000 apartments. That is weakening landlords' pricing power, he says, because homeowners are less concerned about getting full market value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Teresa Opara tried to sell her three-bedroom home in northeast Phoenix last year but got tripped up by the credit crunch. She found a buyer willing to pay her $310,000 asking price. But at the last minute, she says, the buyer's bank changed the lending requirement. "They just said they needed more down payment," says the 57-year-old accountant. Instead, she's renting the house for $1,300 a month, which is what she needs to pay her mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In five struggling markets in Florida, average rents have actually declined since the third quarter. The Tampa-St. Petersburg area saw the largest drop. Average effective rent, which includes free rent and other landlord concessions, was $784 a month at the end of the fourth quarter, down 0.6 percentage point from the previous quarter, according to Reis. In 38 other markets, including Chicago, Boston and St. Louis, rents rose during the fourth quarter, but by less than the national vacancy growth rate of 0.9%. (The rents cited by Reis are a "blended average rent" from complexes with 20 or more units in California and Arizona and 40 or more units in the rest of the country.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Savvy renters in struggling markets are playing landlords off each other. Ms. Evans, of Stuart, Fla., says the same day she and her husband leased their apartment for $1,150 a month, the owner of a bigger home they had looked at called to lower his asking price from $1,500 to $1,200. "If he had called earlier, we would have taken it," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christine Provencio, a 23-year-old legal secretary in Phoenix, considered buying a home with her fiance but instead decided to trade a $580-per-month one-bedroom for a $740-a-month two-bedroom in the same four-unit Phoenix home she has lived in for two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The news isn't gloomy for landlords everywhere. Rents are rising strongly and vacancies are falling in many markets, particularly those with healthy economies that haven't been affected severely by the carnage in the housing industry. Vacancy rates fell in 47 of the 79 markets tracked by Reis, and average rents saw their largest fourth-quarter increase since 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In San Francisco, rents grew 2.7% in the fourth quarter to $1,761 a month. New York City, which has the highest average rent in the country -- $2,717 a month -- saw a 2% rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vacant units fell by 0.9 percentage point to 5.3% in Tacoma, Wash., the biggest drop in the country. In addition, higher rates and fewer financing options for jumbo mortgages -- those bigger than $417,000 -- have kept vacancy rates high in major cities like New York and Los Angeles, where home buyers typically need jumbo loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing experts predict that many would-be home buyers may be forced to rent for years because the relationship between rents and home prices are out of whack. Rents remained at around 5% of home prices throughout much of the postwar period, but beginning in 1996, home-price growth rapidly outpaced rent growth. By the end of 2006, home prices had more than doubled while average rent was up just 48%, driving down the annual rent/price ratio to 3.48%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A study by one former and two current Federal Reserve economists suggests that home prices will have to fall by 15% over the next five years while rents increase by 4% a year to return that rent/price ratio to normal. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. consumer borrowing rose at an annual rate of 7.4% in November, the fastest pace in three months, the Federal Reserve said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 0.6% monthly increase in consumer credit outstanding, to $2.505 trillion, is a positive sign for consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the nation's economic activity. Consumer credit increased at an annual rate of just 1% in October, or 0.08% for the month.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed said revolving credit -- largely credit-card financing -- grew at an 11.3% rate to $937.5 billion, the fastest pace in six months.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Households' nonrevolving credit, such as car and boat loans, rose at an annualized 5.1% pace to $1.568 trillion, rebounding from October's drop in that category, the Fed said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the National Association of Realtors said its forward-looking indicator of existing-home sales fell in November after rising for two months. The industry group's pending-home-sales index, based on signed contracts for homes, declined at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.6% to 87.6.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of homes available for sale in most major metropolitan areas declined in December but remains ample, new data show.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total listings of homes in 29 metropolitan areas at the end of December fell 7.1% from a month earlier, according to figures compiled by ZipRealty Inc., a real-estate brokerage firm based in Emeryville, Calif. The data cover all listings of single-family homes, condominiums and town houses on local multiple-listing services in those areas, where Zip operates.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline is roughly in line with the usual pattern for December, when many potential sellers keep their homes off the market because of the holidays.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total listings at the end of December were still up about 23% from a year earlier in the 17 metro areas for which comparable figures from December 2006 were available.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After surging in 2005 and 2006, the rise in inventories has slowed in some areas recently, and the number of homes on the market has declined from a year earlier in a few. Many sellers have become more flexible on price, and that should spur sales eventually, but foreclosures are adding more homes to the market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, the biggest declines in listings from a month earlier were in the metro areas of Boston (down 13%), San Francisco (11%), Seattle (11%), Orange County, Calif. (10%) and Minneapolis (10%).   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Zip figures don't include the New York area. But data from  <span class="companylink">Corcoran Group</span>, a New York real-estate brokerage, show that December listings declined about 4% from a month earlier in Manhattan and 6.3% in Brooklyn.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors is due to announce today its monthly index of pending home sales and an update of its housing forecast.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. manufacturing sector ended 10 consecutive months of growth in December and contracted, turning in its weakest performance since the spring of 2003.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, U.S. construction spending unexpectedly climbed during November, managing a small increase even though residential construction outlays plunged again.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The retreat of the factory sector was unexpected and a black eye for a part of the U.S. economy that had been faring relatively well in an environment that has been otherwise weighed down by the slumping housing sector. The turn for the manufacturing base should reinvigorate expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon cut rates again.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gloomy news on the factory sector came from private research group the Institute for Supply Management, which said that its December manufacturing index moved to a contractionary 47.7 in November, from 50.8 in November and 50.9 in October. That was the worse pace of activity since April 2003. Numbers in the ISM report higher than 50 indicate growth. Forecasters surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires expected the December index to hit 51.0.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Industries close to the housing market appear to be struggling more than others, and those involved in exports seem to be doing better," said Norbert Ore, who directs the survey for the ISM.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The details of the ISM report were broadly unfavorable. The new orders index for December was 45.7, from 52.6, while its production index hit 47.3, from the prior month's 51.9.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, on the hiring front, the employment index showed contracting payrolls, at a reading of 48.0, from 47.8 the month before. The inventories index for December was 45.5, marking a more broad-based contraction from November's 46.9.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total construction spending rose by 0.1% at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.165 trillion, the U.S. Commerce Department said. October spending fell 0.4%, reflecting a revision upward. Originally, the government said spending that month dropped 0.8%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in November outlays came as a surprise. Wall Street had expected construction spending for the month to decline by 0.4%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential construction spending decreased 2.4% in November to $492 billion. Residential spending fell 2.3% in October; it was originally seen down 2% for the month. Year-to-year, residential spending was 17.5% lower in November.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonresidential construction spending climbed 2.1% in November. Private-sector construction spending during November declined 0.7% to $860.7 billion. Spending fell 0.9% in October.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Public, or government, construction spending increased 2.5% to $304.3 billion. October outlays climbed 0.9%.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes in the U.S. managed a small increase in November from October, the first rise in nine months, but prices declined. Meanwhile, the supply of unsold homes fell -- but remained bloated.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales rose to an annual rate of five million, up 0.4% from an annual pace of 4.98 million in October, the National Association of Realtors said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Given stress in the mortgage market and depressed buyer sentiment, we judge this to be a brief respite and look for sales to fall further,"  <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> economist Michelle Meyer said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Striking a slightly more optimistic note, the association's chief economist, Lawrence Yun, said, "Near term, existing-home sales should continue to hover in a narrow range, just as they have since September, and that's good news because it will be a further sign that the housing market is stabilizing."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a previously owned home in the U.S. fell 3.3% to $210,200 in November from $217,300 a year earlier.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in existing-home sales was the first since February 2007. The Realtors association said disruptions in mortgage availability and pricing peaked in August, which caused sales to slow in subsequent months.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories of homes fell 3.6% to 4.27 million available for sale at the end of November, reflecting a 10.3-month supply at the current sales pace -- high by historical standards.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The supply-demand balance remains decidedly unfavorable for pricing," said Haseeb Ahmed, an analyst at  <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan.</span></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling prices tend to discourage people from putting property on the market. And declining home values can put a chill on consumer spending, which makes up 70% of U.S. economic activity; people feel less wealthy and spend less, analysts say.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Given the weakness in home prices, the huge inventory of unsold homes, the recent tightening in the mortgage market, and the virtual elimination of the subprime market, further significant declines are coming," Insight Economics chief economist Steven Wood wrote in a note to clients. "The housing correction is definitely not complete."   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A KEY GAUGE of U.S. home prices shows they are falling sharply across most of the nation, as a deepening slump in the housing market threatens to damp consumer spending.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Export-driven economies across Asia are keeping a close eye on U.S. spending trends as they brace for a possible slowdown.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in 10 major U.S. metropolitan areas in October were down 6.7% from a year earlier, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home-price indexes, released Wednesday by credit-rating firm  <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's.</span> That exceeded the previous record year-to-year decline of 6.3% in April 1991, when the economy was emerging from a recession.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau, meanwhile, indicate a slowdown in the number of Americans moving to states that led the housing boom, including Nevada, Florida and Arizona.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The silver lining behind the latest home-price data is that they signal the market is making what most economists see as a necessary adjustment, dragging home prices back into closer alignment with Americans' ability to pay. The market is working its way "back to reality," says David Seiders, chief economist of the National Association of Home Builders. He thinks U.S. house prices will bottom out by early 2009.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some other economists say that might not happen before 2010. "The housing shock is only about halfway over, and housing prices will continue to fall well into 2009," says  <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> economist Michelle Meyer.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the housing boom in the first half of this decade, fast-rising home prices made it easy for homeowners to take out home-equity loans or refinance their primary mortgages to extract some cash. That helped sustain consumer spending, which accounts for about 70% of U.S. economic activity.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists now worry that falling home prices will prompt U.S. consumers to pull back on spending enough to slow growth or even tip the economy into recession. "Eventually what's happening in the housing market is going to catch up with us," says Patrick Newport, an economist at research-firm Global Insight Inc.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fears of a sharp drop in consumption were assuaged somewhat last week with a report that U.S. consumer spending in November grew at the fastest pace in 3 1/2 years. And though holiday sales fell short of retailers' expectations, consumers, spurred by discounts, spent heavily in the final days before Christmas. Economists say that even if overall spending slows in December, the strength seen in October and November would be enough to keep the U.S. economy afloat in the near term.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The most important determinant of [spending] is always income," says Harm Bandholz, an economist at  <span class="companylink">UniCredit</span> in New York. He said that Americans' disposable income has risen a "solid" 2.5% over last year. He and others say that as long as the job market holds up and incomes keep growing, Americans will continue to spend.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index showed that some of the fastest declines in home prices are in metropolitan areas that were among the hottest during the housing boom. Prices were down 12.4% from a year earlier in Miami, 11.1% in San Diego, 10.7% in Las Vegas and 10.6% in Phoenix.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are still up from a year ago in some U.S. cities, such as Seattle and Charlotte, N.C. And people who bought their homes several years ago still are sitting on sizable gains in most of the country.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The boom more than doubled prices in many populous areas near the coasts of the U.S. The run-up was fueled in part by unusually low interest rates, which slashed the cost of monthly mortgage payments. In addition, in the wake of the technology-stock bubble, many Americans viewed real estate as a safer investment than stocks, and so poured increasing sums into second homes and rental properties.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home sales began to slow in mid-2005. Prices leveled off and then started declining in 2006. Over the past year, mortgage defaults have soared, leading to rapid growth in foreclosures.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the market adjusts, single-family housing starts have fallen 55% from their January 2006 peak to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 829,000. In recent months, lenders and investors have begun owning up to billions of dollars of losses on mortgages and related securities, clearing the decks for an eventual revival in lending.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the recovery of the housing market is likely to be a gradual process. That's partly because the boom left prices so far out of whack with incomes. As measured by the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller national index, home prices jumped 74% in the six years through 2006. During the same period, U.S. median household income rose 15%. (Neither figure is adjusted for inflation.) That made housing unaffordable for many Americans.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a few years, lax lending standards -- some loans required no down payments and offered low introductory interest rates -- meant U.S. borrowers could buy more expensive houses than they could really afford. But lenders have been burned by a surge in defaults that started in 2006, and such mortgages generally are no longer available. That means house prices will have to fall to a level potential buyers can afford.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Zandi, chief economist of  <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com, a research firm in West Chester, Pennsylvania, predicts that on average U.S. house prices will decline about 12% by the second quarter of 2009 from their peak in the second quarter of 2006. He expects household income to rise by about the same amount over that period.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices of new homes are likely to start recovering in the first half of 2008 because builders are aggressively chopping prices to clear inventories, says Edward Leamer, an economics professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On average, prices of previously occupied homes, as measured by the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller indexes, are likely to drop another 7% in 2008 before flattening out in 2009, says Thomas Lawler, a housing economist in Vienna, Virginia.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories of unsold homes remain very high and may increase in the new year as lenders dump more foreclosed houses on the U.S. market. The number of detached single-family homes listed for sale in October was enough to last 10 1/2 months at the current sales rate, according to the National Association of Realtors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mortgage market also needs to adjust further. Most of the funding for home loans comes from investors who buy securities backed by bundles of mortgages. Since August, many of those investors have shunned the market amid fears of rising defaults.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current scarcity of funds available for mortgage lending creates a chicken-and-egg situation, says Prof. Leamer. Investors who provide funding for home loans don't want to commit more money until they believe the housing market is getting better. But it is hard for the housing market to rebound as long as mortgage credit is tight. Lower prices eventually will break this impasse, by luring buyers back into the market, he says.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A closely watched gauge of U.S. home prices shows they are falling sharply across most of the nation, as a deepening slump in the housing market threatens to damp consumer spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in 10 major metropolitan areas in October were down 6.7% from a year earlier, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home-price indexes, released yesterday by credit-rating firm <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's.</span> That exceeded the previous record year-to-year decline of 6.3% in April 1991, when the economy was emerging from a recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New statistics from the Census Bureau, meanwhile, indicate a slowdown in the number of Americans moving to states that led the housing boom, including Nevada, Florida and Arizona.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The silver lining behind the latest home-price data is that they signal the market is making what most economists see as a necessary adjustment, dragging home prices back into closer alignment with Americans' ability to pay. The market is working its way "back to reality," says David Seiders, chief economist of the National Association of Home Builders. He thinks house prices will bottom out by early 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some other economists say that might not happen before 2010. "The housing shock is only about halfway over, and housing prices will continue to fall well into 2009," says <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> economist Michelle Meyer.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bette Zerba, a Realtor with Re/Max in Phoenix, says local residents trying to sell their homes can't compete with foreclosed homes selling for $50,000 to $100,000 less than theirs. "The sellers now are having to reduce their prices by 20% to 30% to compete," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the market adjusts, single-family housing starts have fallen 55% from their January 2006 peak to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 829,000.

He expects household income to rise by about the same amount over that period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signs of this adjustment are apparent in the latest quarterly analysis of house prices by <span class="companylink">National City Corp.</span>, a Cleveland banking concern, and Global Insight. Economists at the two firms look at home prices in relation to household income and other factors, including population density (an indication of how much land is available) and past differences in prices caused by factors like climate and schools. In the third quarter, they found, prices in 38 of the nation's 330 metro areas were more than 33% above a level that could be explained by fundamental drivers of housing costs. That was down from 48 metro areas in this "overvalued" category in the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Parts of the housing market are scratching bottom right now," says Richard DeKaser, chief economist at National City. Sales of new and existing homes are down about 32% from their mid-2005 peak, he says, and probably won't fall much further before leveling off or starting to recover slowly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices of new homes are likely to start recovering in the first half of 2008 because builders are aggressively chopping prices to clear inventories, says Edward Leamer, an economics professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. Recent price cuts by builders may have reduced demand in the short term because they encourage potential buyers to expect further discounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But prices of previously occupied homes are likely to continue falling slowly for several years, Prof. Leamer says. That's because people trying to sell their homes often don't have an urgent need to move, and try to hold out for a price they consider fair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On average, prices of previously occupied homes, as measured by the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller indexes, are likely to drop another 7% in 2008 before flattening out in 2009, says Thomas Lawler, a housing economist in Vienna, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories of unsold homes remain very high and may increase in the new year as lenders dump more foreclosed houses on the market. The number of detached single-family homes listed for sale in October was enough to last 10 1/2 months at the current sales rate, according to the National Association of Realtors. That was more than double the level of two years ago and the highest since 1985.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with inventories, the nation's home ownership rate will have to adjust to today's realities as many Americans who stretched too far to buy homes in recent years go back to renting. The home ownership rate in the third quarter stood at 68.2% of households, down from a peak of 69.2% in 2004. Even a small drop in that rate has a big effect on housing demand. Economists at <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> have warned that falling home ownership rates may force a further 40% drop in housing starts next year, to an annual rate as low as 500,000 units, before construction starts to recover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mortgage market also needs to adjust further. Most of the funding for home loans comes from investors who buy securities backed by bundles of mortgages. Since August, many of those investors have shunned the market amid fears of rising defaults. As a result, lenders generally are focusing on loans that can be sold to government-sponsored investors Fannie Mae or <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, or insured by the Federal Housing Administration. So-called jumbo loans -- those above $417,000, too big to be sold to Fannie or Freddie -- have grown much more expensive, deterring buyers in high-cost areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current scarcity of funds available for mortgage lending creates a chicken-and-egg situation, says Prof. Leamer. Investors who provide funding for home loans don't want to commit more money until they believe the housing market is getting better. But it's hard for the housing market to rebound as long as mortgage credit is tight. Lower prices eventually will break this impasse, by luring buyers back into the market and reassuring investors that the market is finding a bottom, he says. </p>

</div><div class="author">By Lester Aldrich </div><div>697 words</div><div>26 December 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A7</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next year is expected to be a long, hard year for lumber producers and dealers, some market analysts say, because the current home-building slump may not bottom until the fourth quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An actual rebound in new home sales likely will wait until 2009, according to the National Association of Realtors. In a paper dated Dec. 10, NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun said existing home sales are projected to trend slightly higher in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After problems with subprime mortgages began to show up earlier this year, troubles with other mortgages and house valuations followed, leading to a year of mortgage-rate problems. House values declined, foreclosures increased, home sales fell, housing starts plummeted and lumber prices fell well below profitable levels for the mills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One result has been protracted losses at North American lumber mills, especially those in Canada that sell most of their production in the U.S. and are paid in U.S. funds. A weakening U.S. dollar meant producers got less for their products, crimping the bottom line for the mills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even U.S. government intervention to slow the rate of foreclosures may not be enough to actually reverse the trend until late 2008, market analysts said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosures were down 10 percentage points in November from October, according to RealtyTrac, a mortgage research company. However, they were up 68% nationwide from a year earlier, RealtyTrac said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One lumber-market analyst said that even if the rate of foreclosures declines before the fourth quarter, the uncertainty surrounding pending foreclosures may keep housing and lumber markets on edge for a while. Only a series of well-publicized reports about foreclosure rates, home sales or other economic factors indicating an end to the housing slump would turn investors into buyers of lumber, houses or even home-builder stock, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Market analysts note that the housing market will need to begin drawing down its inventory of unsold existing and new houses before a serious recovery can take place. A question among most is just how the foreclosed houses are affecting the overall number of existing homes already put up for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Walter Malony, NAR senior public affairs associate involved with industry trends, research studies and reports, said many foreclosures don't end up with a Realtor's "for sale" sign out front. Many are auctioned to clear the bank's books. He said some also could go to brokers who specialize in disposing of foreclosed houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no data to identify the number of foreclosures, Mr. Malony said, but the NAR believes the number is only a small percentage of the total inventory of existing houses for sale. NAR economists project about 200,000 foreclosures in 2008, compared with the current total of about 4.5 million houses for sale in the U.S., he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Leonard, Chicago Mercantile Exchange floor trader and lumber-market analyst for Rosenthal-Collins Group LLC, said the current unprecedented rate of lumber-mill production cuts could lead to a gradual tightening of supplies, even at the current residual rate of consumption. This could lead to a short-term rally in lumber prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, after that, the market may fade as buyers pull away from the higher quotes, Mr. Leonard said. The market could see another seasonal price rally into the spring as just-in-time buyers fill orders for new houses and for remodeling demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Graham Dallimore, a broker at Global Futures Corp., said repair and remodeling demand is down only 5%, and since this is rarely discussed, many may think lumber demand is worse than it really is. Industrial demand "is pretty good," too, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total lumber demand will have to wait for housing to improve before it can rebound, Mr. Dallimore said. While he said he doesn't expect housing to stabilize until the end of 2008, declining prices are setting the stage by making houses more affordable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once houses are seen as affordable and a good investment, there will be enough pent-up demand to make the housing recovery of 2009 noticeable, Mr. Dallimore said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE PACE of groundbreaking for home construction in the U.S. fell in November, while building permits slid to the lowest level in 141/2 years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts declined 3.7% to a seasonally adjusted 1.187 million annual rate, after rising 4.2% in the previous month to 1.232 million, the Commerce Department said. Originally, Commerce reported October starts 3% higher at 1.229 million. Year-to-year, housing starts during November were 24.2% below the level of construction in the same month of 2006. Building permits decreased 1.5% to a 1.152 million annual rate in November, the lowest level since June 1993.   </p>

</div><div class="author">By Kelly Evans </div><div>483 words</div><div>19 December 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A15</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of new-home construction fell to a 16-year low in November, and fewer building permits were issued, as homebuilders struggled with bloated inventories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported construction of new homes fell 3.7% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.19 million units, the lowest since April 1991. The biggest decline was in construction of single-family homes, which dropped 5.4% from the previous month and 34.9% from November 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newly issued building permits fell 1.5% last month and were down 25% from a year earlier. Permits are a leading, but imperfect, indicator of new construction because they don't capture subsequent cancellations of projects. "New homes are competing with vacant units in the existing housing stock left behind by hordes of investors and speculators gobbling everything up during the boom period," said Dave Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders. "It's a tough period for builders."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAHB's December survey of homebuilder confidence, released Monday, recorded a record low for the third straight month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest drop in single-family home construction marks the eighth straight month of declines as homebuilders work to pare excess inventories of new homes. Economists expect the pullback in new construction to subtract about one percentage point from gross domestic product this quarter, as it did in the third quarter. Most of them expect fourth-quarter GDP to grow at an annualized rate of less than 1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Moody, chief economist at Mission Residential, a real-estate investment firm, said there needs to be "even more aggressive pullbacks" in new construction to bring supply in line with depressed demand for houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current pace of overall new construction is down by 48.2% from its peak in January 2006. Mr. Moody said that compares with declines of 52% to 63% in past housing downturns. "We still have a way to go," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of multifamily units -- up 4.4% from October and 22.1% from a year earlier -- continues to help offset the decline in single-family housing. Ben Herzon, a senior economist at St. Louis's Macroeconomic Advisers, said multifamily construction "is not as important for near-term GDP growth" because it accounts for a smaller part of the market. It also tends to be volatile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By region, new single-family construction in the West -- including California, Nevada and Arizona -- was down 38.3% from November 2006. Activity in the South, which has been weighed down in particular by problems in Florida, was down 36.1%. New single-family home construction was down 29.2% from a year earlier in the Northeast and down 28.6% in the Midwest. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts are forecast to fall 5.7% for November, resuming a downward path after a surprise 3% increase logged for October. The October figure was buoyed by multifamily building, however. Inventories of single-family homes remain bloated. Commerce Department data at 8:30 a.m. EST.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending home sales rose for the second month in a row but remain below year-ago levels, the National Association of Realtors reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pending-sales index, which is based on contracts signed and is a leading indicator of existing-home sales, rose 0.6% to 87.2 in October from a revised 86.7 in September and 85.5 in August. The Realtors' chief economist, Lawrence Yun, said the data suggested the worst declines are over. <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> economists continued "to be negative on housing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">October sales were 18.4% below the year-earlier level. Sales in the Northeast jumped 16% from September. They rose 8.4% in the West, but slipped 1.4% in the Midwest and fell 7.8% in the South. </p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>490 words</div><div>6 December 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes for sale in 18 major metro areas declined in November, marking the second monthly decrease in a row.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline is roughly in line with normal seasonal trends, and the supply of houses and condominiums for sale remains at unusually high levels in most of the country. Moreover, some economists expect inventories to bloat again early next year as more foreclosed homes hit the market and tight credit deters buyers. Still, the modest decline over the past two months is a positive sign for a housing market suffering from a glut of properties for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total listings of homes in the 18 metro areas at the end of November were down 2.5% from a month earlier, according to figures compiled by ZipRealty Inc., a real-estate brokerage firm in Emeryville, Calif. The data cover all listings of single-family homes, condos and town houses on multiple-listing services in those areas, where Zip operates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest declines were in the metro areas of Boston (down 8.2%) and San Francisco (6.4%). Inventory grew 2.8% in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale area, where there is an immense glut of condos, and was little changed in the metro areas of Phoenix, Orlando, Tampa and Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, the number of detached single-family homes on the market in October was enough to last 10 1/2 months at the current sales rate, according to the National Association of Realtors. That's more than double the level of two years ago and the highest since 1985.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Inventories of unsold homes will rise substantially further in coming quarters" as foreclosures increase and tighter lending standards take more potential buyers out of the market, writes Mark Zandi, chief economist of <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com, a research firm in West Chester, Pa., in a new report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On average, U.S. house prices will decline about 13% by the second quarter of 2009 from their 2006 peak, Mr. Zandi says. But the declines will be much larger in many parts of Florida, California, Arizona and Nevada as well as in the metro areas of Washington, D.C., and Detroit, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That forecast assumes that the economy doesn't fall into a recession. But Mr. Zandi and other economists see a growing risk of recession next year. In that case, he says in an interview, the average price decline is likely to be around 25%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zandi describes the current housing slump as the worst since the Depression and says rising sales and production won't return to their normal, rising trends until "well into the next decade." But he adds that the pervasive gloom does signal a needed shift in psychology, convincing more sellers they will need to slash prices enough to entice buyers. "It's capitulation," he says. </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction spending declined 0.8% in October as private nonresidential construction dropped a surprising 0.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While monthly nonresidential-construction data can be volatile, the drop -- the first in 13 months -- reinforced concerns about the impact of tightening credit conditions on businesses. Residential construction fell 2%, the Commerce Department said. The decline reflected weak demand for single-family homes as the housing market grapples with a supply glut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, a key measure of inflation remained tame in October as consumer spending and income showed tepid gains to start the fourth quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surging energy prices sent the price index for personal-consumption expenditures up 0.3% from September and 2.9% from a year earlier. The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, rose 0.2% in October and 1.9% from a year earlier, staying in the 1%-to-2% comfort zone of some Fed officials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personal spending rose 0.2% in October after increases of 0.3% in September and 0.4% in August. An additional worry: Incomes rose only 0.2%, offering little support for higher consumption.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> economists lowered their fourth-quarter estimate for gross domestic product to a 0.2% annual rate of growth from 0.3%. Some forecasters now expect the economy to contract.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Ben Casselman </div><div>1853 words</div><div>30 November 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>W1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as the national housing market has been hit by slow sales and falling prices, Manhattan has continued to shine. But now its light may be dimming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fewer apartments are being sold -- 858 went into contract in September, a 9.9% drop from a year ago and the lowest total in two years, according to brokerage <span class="companylink">Corcoran Group</span> -- and the inventory of unsold apartments is increasing. Prices are also leveling off. The median price of a Manhattan apartment fell 3.4% in the third quarter from the previous one, according to the research firm Radar Logic. The firm says properties are sitting on the market longer, too, an average of 123 days, up from 94 days at the peak of the market in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers used to seeing yet-to-be-built apartments get snapped up sight-unseen are increasingly offering incentives, from help with closing costs to museum memberships, to jump-start sales. "Buyers are more hesitant," says Hall Willkie, president of brokerage Brown Harris Stevens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One big factor is how much money New York's army of financial executives will make this year, given the wild swings on Wall Street. "Right now, everyone's waiting for bonus time," says Stephen Kliegerman, executive director of development marketing for brokerage Halstead Property. "No one knows what to expect." Many analysts anticipate this year's Wall Street bonuses, which will be paid early in 2008, to be roughly equal to last year's record $36 billion. But individual payouts will vary much more widely than in recent years, with bankers in the mortgage sector receiving much less than last year, and those working in healthier markets making far more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trouble in the financial sector will hurt home sales, says Nouriel Roubini, an economics professor at New York University's Stern School of Business. "We're talking about hundreds of billions of dollars in losses on Wall Street," he says. "We could see people being fired, and when that happens, demand will fall."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan makes up a tiny fraction of U.S. home sales. Its housing market is closely watched, however, because of the city's position at the center of the financial and media worlds. In recent months, the continuing strength of its real-estate market has drawn even more attention, and led many local real-estate professionals to contend that Manhattan is immune to the forces that have battered much of the rest of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But few independent experts buy that argument. Christopher Mayer, a Columbia University professor and director of the school's Paul Milstein Center for Real Estate, says the idea that Manhattan will continue to boom amid a nationwide housing bust is "wishful thinking."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I certainly don't think Manhattan is recession-proof," Prof. Mayer says. "History just says that's a wrong argument."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some buyers are already finding bargains. When hedge-fund executive Jerry Lavish and his wife, Stanka, started looking at apartments earlier this fall, they liked a three-bedroom co-op on East 72nd Street -- but not its $1,775,000 price tag. Two weeks later, however, the sellers cut the price to $1,575,000, and the Lavishes jumped; they're expecting to sign a contract today. Mr. Lavish, who says he did extensive online research before making an offer, believes the same property might have gone for $1.9 million a year ago. "We're getting this apartment for probably 2004 pricing," he says. (The downside: The Lavishes are listing their current apartment for $475,000, nearly 10% below their original asking price.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, almost no one is steeling for a crash in Manhattan. Prof. Roubini believes prices will fall 10% over the next two years, substantially less than the 30% or more he predicts will occur in many markets. Nationwide, existing-home prices were down 5.1% in October, and sales were down a seasonally adjusted 20.7%, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, fall sales data in Manhattan suggest a flattening out of the market more than a sharp decline. Sales volume in the third quarter was down 11.2% compared with the previous quarter, but that was still well above the level from the previous year, according to Radar Logic. (Those numbers reflect sales that closed in the third quarter, many of which were negotiated earlier in the year.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices remain near record levels. The median price of a Manhattan apartment is $864,397, up 2.3% from a year ago. And broader economic forces may provide an added cushion: While tumbling Wall Street earnings have damped the enthusiasm of some potential buyers who work in the finance industry, the weak dollar has led to increased interest from abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some brokers say they haven't seen a drop-off at all. Pamela Liebman, chief executive of <span class="companylink">Corcoran Group</span>, says the brokerage is on pace for a record year and says that after a September slowdown, October showed an increase in sales. Jacqueline Urgo, president of the national real-estate firm The Marketing Directors, says sales in most of the company's Manhattan properties improved in mid-September after a brief lull. Even many brokers who have seen a falloff say the shift says less about the current market than the frenzied one that preceded it. "We're just seeing the market return to normal," says John Burger, a broker at Brown Harris Stevens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, as preliminary sales statistics begin to trickle in for October and early November, some New York brokers and potential sellers are growing nervous. So far this quarter, 1,473 sales have been recorded in Manhattan compared with 4,337 for the entire quarter last year, according to Gregory Heym, chief economist for Terra Holdings, which owns brokerages Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead Property. Many sales negotiated earlier in the quarter haven't closed yet, but with December usually a slow month, Mr. Heym says there will almost certainly be fewer sales this quarter than last.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City officials are also predicting a slowdown. In October, the Office of Management and Budget cut its projected revenue from property transfers by $82 million, a 5.9% drop from its original forecast. (The figure includes revenue from both commercial and residential sales.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices, too, may finally be reaching their zenith, after years of rapid increases. While average prices remain high, experts say the numbers have been skewed in recent months by a few record-breaking sales in new luxury-condo projects such as 15 Central Park West and the Plaza. (Among the mega-sales: a 6,744-square-foot apartment at 15 Central Park West that sold in September for $42.4 million, and a 13,000-square-foot Plaza condo that went for more than $50 million in July.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To get a better sense of how prices are changing, many experts recommend focusing on existing-home sales. In New York, that means looking at the co-op market, which includes few new buildings. The average sales price of a co-op fell 2.8% to $1.12 million in third quarter of 2007, compared with the second quarter, according to Radar Logic. Even when condos are included, prices vary widely in different parts of the island; so far this quarter, the average price on the Upper East Side has risen 11% to $1.7 million, compared with the previous quarter, but prices downtown have fallen 18%, to $1.1 million, according to Terra Holdings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sellers and local brokers point to August or September as the start of the shift. Sean Connell and his wife, Patty Klingbiel, listed their pied-a-terre on East 28th Street for $495,000 in May. They quickly accepted an offer for $480,000, but their co-op board rejected the buyer. By the time the apartment went back on the market in August, the market had changed and the price was too high; earlier this month, the couple cut the price to $450,000. "Since the summer, [buyers have] been a little more cautious," says their broker, Carlos Saavedra of <span class="companylink">Corcoran Group.</span> (Mr. Connell says he remains optimistic they will sell the apartment by the end of the year.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts say several factors have helped to insulate Manhattan from the national downturn thus far. The boards of co-ops, which make up about 70% of all Manhattan apartments, are often stricter than banks, requiring much more money upfront from would-be buyers (some allow no financing at all) and scouring their financial records for hints of trouble. As a result, co-ops have seen far fewer foreclosures than the rest of the country. Even in condo buildings, which have looser standards, high prices meant few subprime mortgages. (That wasn't true of New York City's outer boroughs, where subprime mortgages were more prevalent and foreclosures have risen; citywide, foreclosures were up nearly 65% in the third quarter from a year earlier, according to a report by PropertyShark.com.) The weak dollar has also encouraged an influx of foreign buyers, while record bonuses on Wall Street last winter further fueled demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supply, however, is increasing. The city approved the building or conversion of 14,748 condo and co-op units in Manhattan in 2006; citywide, such approvals were up 75.8% from 2005. And more are in the pipeline. "I would not want to be owning a project that's coming on the market in the next year or two," Prof. Mayer says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The impact of the increased supply is already being felt. A handful of new developments have begun to offer incentives to attract buyers, something nearly unheard of at the height of the boom. Several projects are offering beefed-up commissions, or even gift cards, to brokers who sell units; 45 Park Ave., in the Murray Hill neighborhood, is offering a one-year membership to the Morgan Library and Museum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of price cuts, at all levels of the market, is also growing. Blair MacInnes is handling the sale of her 85-year-old mother's Upper East Side apartment; she listed the two-bedroom co-op in September for $2,095,000, the price recommended by her broker, Dorry Swope of Halstead Property. "We were very worried about putting the apartment on the market," Ms. MacInnes says, "but we had been told by any number of people that the exception to the housing crisis had been Manhattan." The apartment drew little interest, however, and Ms. MacInnes and her mother agreed to cut the price, first to $1,995,000 and then again a few days later to $1,779,000 -- a total cut of more than 15%. Although the new price has generated more interest but no solid offers, Ms. MacInnes says she and her mother aren't in a rush to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But do we want to wait until the market bounces back?" she asks. "Who knows when that will be?"</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sudeep Reddy </div><div>1368 words</div><div>29 November 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve, faced with mounting signs of a slowing economy, opened the door to an interest-rate cut next month, cheering the nation's stock market, which staged its biggest two-day rally in five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest signal from the central bank came in remarks by Donald Kohn, its vice chairman, which represented a Fed acknowledgment that the financial-market turmoil that started this summer remains a threat to the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a speech in New York, Mr. Kohn, a confidant of Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, said recent turbulence in the credit markets has "partly reversed some of the improvement in market functioning" that was seen last month. "The degree of deterioration that's happened over the last couple of weeks is not something I personally anticipated," he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Partly in response, stocks shrugged off disappointing news about the housing market and reports suggesting weak consumer spending. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 331.01 points, or 2.6%, to 13289.45, the latest in a five-day string of 100-point-plus moves that have whipsawed investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sharp moves reflect uncertainty about the economy's direction as the credit crunch continues to play out in slow motion. In August, worries about defaults on risky mortgages froze up credit markets and led banks to impose stricter lending terms. The Fed responded by injecting funds into financial markets, easing loan terms and ultimately cutting interest rates. Initially, stocks rallied and yields on risky debt declined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But those trends reversed this month as banks and other financial institutions reported unexpectedly large losses on mortgage-related investments. Tighter credit continues to depress the housing market, fueling fears about a downturn in consumer spending, and threatening business investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past two days, the Dow industrials have risen more than 540 points, or more than 4%, the biggest two-day percentage gain since 2002. All 30 stocks in the blue-chip average were up yesterday. But that rally followed a 237-point decline on Monday, which put the industrials 10% below their record of 14164.53 hit on Oct. 9, fulfilling the textbook definition of a market correction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday, hopes for a rate cut by the Fed were particularly welcomed by investors in financial stocks. <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch &amp;Co.</span> soared 8.9%; <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc.</span>, 6.7%; <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;Co.</span>, 3.8%; and <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp.</span>, 4.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday's upturn was buoyed by news of the <span class="companylink">Abu Dhabi Investment Authority</span>'s $7.5 billion investment in <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>, a sign of hope for banks and other financial companies, many of which need fresh capital in the wake of mortgage-related losses. <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>'s shares rose 6.5% yesterday, building on Tuesday's 1.9% rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kohn and other Fed officials are increasingly worried that banks, stung by losses from soured mortgage bets, will, as he put it, "adopt a more defensive posture in granting credit, not only for house purchases, but for other uses as well."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would bode ill for economic growth. Private-sector economists already think the economy will grow at much less than a 1% annual rate in the current quarter; <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> economists yesterday halved their estimates and now foresee fourth-quarter growth of just 0.3%. The government today is expected to revise sharply upward its estimate of third-quarter growth, but that won't help the outlook for the current quarter or next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest readings on the housing market also are bleak. The National Association of Realtors said yesterday that U.S. sales of existing homes fell again in October, and at the current sales pace there are now 10.5 months worth of single-family homes on the market, the most since July 1985.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reports from the Fed's regional banks, released yesterday, suggest that the pace of growth is slowing, with indications of "relatively soft retail spending" and a "slow holiday season." They also cited "mixed" reports on manufacturing and some signs of weakness in commercial and industrial lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market had been worried the Fed's concerns about inflation would keep it from taking action at its next meeting, on Dec. 11. "Now the market smells a move by the Fed in two weeks," says Jim Swanson, chief investment strategist at Boston's <span class="companylink">MFS Investment Management.</span> "That's giving the market a lift."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others cautioned against reading too much optimism into the upturn. "The market is having a bounce after a correction," said Alan Gayle, senior investment strategist at Trusco Capital Management. "The rally could last for a few days, but it's not going to take us to a new high, since the market hasn't finished factoring in the negative news."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Derek Frey, head trader at Odom &amp;Frey, predicted more volatility as the euphoria of the past few days is followed by mood swings in the other direction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although futures markets lately have been betting that the Fed will cut its target for short-term interest rates -- now at 4.5% -- by one-quarter percentage point on Dec. 11, Fed officials have been sending mixed messages. Several have emphasized publicly that inflation remains a worry, despite the worsening outlook for economic growth, which complicates any discussion of cutting rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kohn didn't say yesterday whether he thinks a rate cut is needed, but his apparent openness to a cut represents an important shift in tone by the Fed's leadership. Mr. Bernanke may provide more clues in a speech scheduled for tonight in Charlotte, N.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed officials had hoped the central bank's moves since August to lower the discount rate -- the rate at which it lends directly to banks -- and to cut benchmark interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point would be enough to boost confidence in the financial market and head off a credit crunch. But the re-emergence of turbulence underscores the potential threat tighter lending standards pose to consumer and business spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the heels of reports earlier this week that consumer confidence was deteriorating, the most recent reading on the housing market wasn't encouraging. Sales of existing homes, including townhouses, condos and co-ops, fell 1.2% in October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.97 million units, the Realtors group said yesterday. Sales are now running 20.7% behind last year. The decline came mainly in the Midwest and West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price of the median house or condominium -- the one right in the middle of the market -- dropped to $207,800, down 5.1% from a year earlier. Prices for single-family homes are down 6.3% from October 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed's Mr. Kohn said yesterday housing continues to deteriorate at a "very, very rapid" rate, adding, "I don't think we have seen the bottom."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the housing market bottoms out by spring, Fed officials believe consumer spending could remain resilient, allowing the economy to sidestep a deeper downturn. Several Wall Street forecasters, however, are expecting declines totaling 15% before the market hits bottom, only a third of which have already occurred.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There seems to be no silver lining in the darkening cloud overhanging the housing market," Nomura Securities chief economist David Resler said yesterday in a note to clients. "The risks that the weakness in this sector will pull the overall economy into recession are rising by the hour."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Commerce Department said orders for durable goods -- items designed to last three or more years -- dropped 0.4% in October, the third month in a row the volatile measure has fallen. "New orders, while showing their typical month-to-month volatility, have traced a sideways pattern in the past one to two years," said Michael Moran, an economist with Daiwa Securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched barometer of business investment, fell 2.3% in October after a 1.2% gain in September. So far this year, these orders are running 1.7% behind last year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- A top U.S. Federal Reserve official said yesterday that recent financial turbulence has undone "some of the improvement in market functioning over the late part of September and in October," and he repeated the need for "nimble" monetary policy to address economic risks.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The remarks, by Vice Chairman Donald Kohn, suggest that interest-rate reductions remain on the table even though policy makers adopted a neutral view of growth and inflation risks at their last meeting.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Fed, in its latest beige book report, said the U.S. housing sector remains "quite depressed" with a turnaround not expected by builders until late 2008 at the earliest. It added that housing weakness may be spilling over to consumer spending, which makes up two-thirds of economic activity. "Reports on retail spending were downbeat in general," the Fed said, and "looking ahead, the reports were slightly pessimistic about prospects for the holiday retail season."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In prepared remarks before the Council on Foreign Relations, Mr. Kohn said, "Should the elevated turbulence persist, it would increase the possibility of further tightening in financial conditions for households and businesses."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Kohn said that nonfinancial businesses remain in "very good" financial condition, and that outside of the adjustable-rate-mortgage market, "households are meeting their obligations with, to date, only a little increase in delinquency rates, which generally remain at low levels." But the damage could spread, he cautioned.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street viewed Mr. Kohn's comments as hinting that additional rate cuts could be forthcoming, which helped push U.S. stocks higher yesterday.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, existing-home sales fell an eighth straight month in October, a victim of the credit crunch.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home resales dropped to a 4.97 million annual rate, a 1.2% decrease from September's revised 5.03 million annual pace, the National Association of Realtors said yesterday. September's rate was originally estimated at 5.04 million.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home price was $207,800 in October, down 5.1% from $218,900 in October 2006. The median price in September this year was $210,400.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last time sales rose was February 2007. NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun cited "the lingering impact of the credit crunch" in the October drop. "October sales figures continued to be soft," he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The October resales level was below Wall Street expectations of a five-million sales rate for previously owned homes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data from the Commerce Department yesterday showed that demand for expensive manufactured goods dropped a third straight month in October, while a barometer for capital spending by businesses took its biggest fall in eight months.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for durable goods decreased by 0.4% last month to a seasonally adjusted $214.45 billion. Durables, which are goods designed to last at least three years, decreased 1.4% in September, revised from a previously estimated 1.7% decline.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders during October for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft fell by 2.3% -- the largest decline since 2.4% in February 2007.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Apartments, Offices</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Capitalization rates, which have fallen steadily since 2001, inched up last month for apartment buildings and office properties.

In October, average cap rates for apartment buildings were 6.10%, up from 6.08% in September. For central-business-district office properties, average cap rates rose to 5.80% in October, after hitting a low of 5.54% in September. </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sluggish pace of home building in October offered little solace to those looking for signs the nation's housing bust has bottomed out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home construction rose 3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.229 million units last month from September -- the first monthly gain since June -- but the increase was driven entirely by construction of multifamily buildings with five or more units. Construction in that volatile sector soared 47% after falling 36% in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of new single-family homes, considered a better gauge of the overall housing market, fell 7.3% last month from September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 884,000 units, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With last month's rise in home building "more than accounted for by a jump in the multifamily sector, we view it as purely technical, and not a sign that housing is recovering," said <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> economist Gary Bigg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, building permits for housing units, an indicator of new construction, dropped 6.6% in October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.178 million units. Permits often precede construction by about one month, though high cancellation rates mean that not all permits become new homes. Mr. Bigg said permits have tumbled to their lowest level since 1993.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of single-family homes in October fell 25% from the year-earlier period, with the steepest declines in the South, where it dropped 31%, and the West, where it fell 30%. The Midwest and the Northeast fared better, with respective declines of 9.8% and 4.7% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the housing slump continues, economists are lowering their forecasts for economic growth in the fourth quarter. After the latest data were released, Macroeconomic Advisers shaved its forecast for fourth-quarter growth in gross domestic product by 0.1 percentage point to a 0.8% annual rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> economist Haseeb Ahmed said new construction of single-family homes is down 52% from its January 2006 peak. Mr. Ahmed sees no sign the slump has hit bottom. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Home construction in the U.S. unexpectedly climbed in October, rising for the first time in four months, but a sign of future groundbreakings fell to the lowest level in 14 years, indicating the housing slump will continue.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts increased 3% to a seasonally adjusted 1.229 million annual rate, after falling 11.4% in September to 1.193 million, the Commerce Department said yesterday. Originally, Commerce reported September starts fell 10.2% to 1.191 million.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase surprised Wall Street. The median forecast of 23 economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires called for a 0.9% drop to a 1.18 million annual rate. The last time starts increased was in June.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Year-to-year, housing starts during October were 16% below the level of construction in October 2006.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builder sentiment remains at record lows. Bloated supplies of unsold houses are discouraging construction, and foreclosures are expected to add to those inventories. As for demand, falling home prices and banks' tightening of lending standards are restraining purchases.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A key indicator in yesterday's data suggested an even lower level of future groundbreakings. Building permits fell 6.6% to a 1.178 million annual rate in October -- the lowest level since 1.174 million in July 1993. Economists had expected permits to decline 4% to a rate of 1.21 million. September permits slipped 4.6% to 1.261 million.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">September single-family housing starts fell 7.3% to 884,000. Construction of housing with two or more units rose 44.4% to 345,000; within that category, groundbreakings of homes with five or more units -- or multifamily -- rose 46.5%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regionally, housing starts rose 5.8% in the West, 21.1% in the Midwest and 8.5% in the Northeast. Starts fell 4.6% in the South.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, an estimated 110,400 houses were actually started in October, based on unseasonally adjusted figures.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Home History</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Repeats, Then</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Look Out</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is no longer worth debating whether the housing market is getting worse. The more important question is how much worse it will get.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With financial firms racking up more mortgage-related losses -- yesterday it was Swiss Reinsurance with an $876 million write-down -- would-be home buyers are going to have a hard time getting loans. Ratings downgrades on some mortgage-backed securities mean some institutions simply don't have the mandate to buy them. Even when the smoke clears, those buyers won't come back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday, the National Association of Home Builders said its measure of builder confidence remained at record lows in November. Expect more bad news today. Economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires estimate builders broke ground on new homes in October at an annualized rate of 1.18 million units, down 49% from the peak early last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These housing-starts numbers are notoriously volatile. It is possible the actual October figures will bounce instead. If the past is any guide, they could fall much further. Starts saw three peak-to-trough declines of more than 60% in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, an unprecedented number of houses don't have anyone living in them. According to the Census Bureau, 2.7% of U.S. homeowner inventory (which excludes rentals, vacation homes and homes that are sold and awaiting occupancy) is vacant and for sale. Before last year, that figure had never been higher than 1.9%. Just to get the vacancy level back to that point, the market needs to absorb more than 500,000 empty homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe home builders should knock off work until spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small-Business Engine</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is Sputtering Under Slump</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small businesses have been the economy's little engines that could. But the housing slowdown might be taking away the chug, chug, chug.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's earnings report from <span class="companylink">Office Depot</span> could reflect the rising impact of the weakening housing market on small businesses. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial expect the company to post net income of 40 cents a share, down 18% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weakening sales to its small-business customers are part of the problem. At a September retailing conference, Office Depot Chief Executive Steve Odland said purchases by small-business customers connected to the housing market, such as real-estate agents and contractors, are "down very significantly." The company estimates the percentage of its customers in housing-related businesses is in the double-digit range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small business matters a lot to the economy. Companies with 500 or more employees have been cutting positions in the U.S., and adding them overseas, while smaller companies have been expanding at a solid clip, according to <span class="companylink">Automatic Data Processing Inc.</span>, a payroll processor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The growth is cooling off. At businesses with fewer than 50 employees, 501,000 workers have been added to payrolls this year through October, according to ADP. That is down from 655,000 for the same period a year ago, and 827,000 in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An October survey of small businesses by the National Federation of Independent Business shows a net of 11% of the companies surveyed plan to increase employment, down from 14% from the previous month.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tucson's slowing economy is likely to curtail some planned commercial-real-estate construction, but the downturn may enable Arizona's second-largest metropolitan area to shift its attention to larger, public projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowdown is expected even as the region's commercial real estate ranks among the nation's healthiest. Tucson's commercial real-estate market tied with two other markets for the sixth-strongest score out of 59 U.S. markets surveyed by Moody's Investors Service in a report based on second-quarter data. By contrast, larger neighbor Phoenix tied with two other markets for the fourth-weakest overall score, in part because of a glut of suburban office construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tucson's commercial markets will weaken on the tails of housing, says Marshall Vest, an economist at University of Arizona's Eller College of Management in Tucson. "They're probably at or past their peaks," Mr. Vest said, noting that Tucson could weather a downturn better than Phoenix because there was less overbuilding. "Things didn't get quite as crazy here," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Tucson metropolitan area, with one million residents just north of the Mexican border, is driven by tourism, the defense industry, construction and many smaller service companies. Job growth slipped to 2.1% in September from an annual rate of about 3.5% in 2006, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Mr. Vest predicts the economy could post a net loss of jobs by year's end as the housing market continues to batter mortgage lenders and the construction sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage lender <span class="companylink">First Magnus Financial Corp.</span>, one of the city's largest employers, filed for bankruptcy-law protection in August. Median prices of condominiums and co-ops dropped 10% in the second quarter from a year earlier to $153,800, the third-largest percentage drop in the nation after New Orleans and Syracuse, N.Y., among markets tracked by the National Association of Realtors. The median price of existing single-family homes increased only 1.1% in the second quarter from a year earlier. That is a significant shift compared with 2005, when the area's median price rose 30.6% from 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, Tucson's commercial-real-estate market remains largely on the upswing. A relatively small industrial sector is among the strongest, with vacancies at a 10-year-low, says Don Ahee Jr. of <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span> Tucson. Retailer Target Corp. is planning to open a 975,000-square-foot facility in 2009 to service its online business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowing housing market has cooled efforts to add condominiums intended to revitalize an area of downtown known as Rio Nuevo. Several condo projects that had been expected to be completed this year or next have been delayed, says Jaret Barr, assistant to the Tucson city manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Barr says the city will use the pause to focus on other projects. The city plans to begin construction next year on a $130 million arena with a design inspired by a desert tortoise, a $60 million expansion of the city's convention center and a new convention-center hotel, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, construction on another project, One North Fifth, is moving ahead. Portland, Ore., developer Williams &amp;Dame Development and its local partners plan to turn Tucson's 1960s-era public-housing facility into rental apartments in an effort to bring new life to a largely 9-to-5 downtown and jump-start the sluggish demand for condos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matt Brown, project manager for One North Fifth with Williams &amp;Dame, says the renovation aims to enhance the property while staying true to the original. "We're not trying to hide the fact that it's a modern concrete building, but with the new retail in the front, it's going to have a whole new look," he said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Rex Nutting </div><div>305 words</div><div>31 October 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices continue to fall in most major U.S. metropolitan areas, according to the latest update of the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home price indexes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices of single-family homes in 20 major U.S. metro areas in August were down an average of 4.4% from a year earlier, <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span>, a division of <span class="companylink">McGraw-Hill Cos.</span>, reported yesterday. Prices in those metro areas fell an average of 0.8% from July to August, the fastest monthly decline in the seven-year history of the 20-city index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices as measured by this index have been down from a year earlier for eight straight months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The fall in home prices is showing no real signs of a slowdown or turnaround," said Robert J. Shiller, co-creator of the index and chief economist for MacroMarkets LLC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller indexes track multiple sales of the same homes in an attempt to screen out price differences caused by shifts in the size and type of houses being sold. Some housing economists consider these indexes the best gauge of national and metro real-estate values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest declines are in the Rust Belt and in the formerly boom towns near the coasts. In the Tampa, Fla., area, prices were down about 10% from a year earlier. Prices continued to rise, though at a more modest rate, in parts of the Pacific Northwest and the South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eight of the 20 metro areas recorded their largest-ever year-over-year declines in August. Prices were up in five metro areas, led by Seattle with a 5.7% increase and Charlotte, N.C., with 5.6%. </p>

</div><div class="author">By Tom Barkley   </div><div>345 words</div><div>25 October 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Demand for previously owned homes in the U.S. slid more than expected in September amid continued problems in the mortgage market, cementing expectations for another rate cut next week by the U.S. Federal Reserve.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall home resales declined to a 5.04 million annual rate, an 8% decrease from August's downwardly revised 5.48 million annual pace, the National Association of Realtors said yesterday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The September existing-home sales level came in well below Wall Street expectations for a 5.25 million rate. The 5.04 million pace is the lowest since the association started accounting for combined single-family homes and condo sales in 1999. Based on single-family home sales of 4.38 million, the September figures are the weakest since January 1998.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The credit freeze in August definitely impacted sales in September, particularly the jumbo [loan] side, so we have seen a large sales decline in the upper end of the market," NAR senior economist Lawrence Yun said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home price was $211,700 in September, down 4.2% from $220,900 in September 2006. The median price in August this year was $224,400.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yun said conditions in the jumbo-loan market have improved, so he still expects 2007 to rank as the fifth-best year in terms of existing-home sales. Prices are expected to ease about 1.5% from a record last year of $221,900.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some private-sector economists are in wait-and-see mode, considering that parts of the mortgage market have started to recover. Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital, said he isn't surprised by the bigger-than-expected drop in sales.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have mentally 'written off' the existing-home-sales figures for the next month or two and are far more interested in whether home sales stabilize or even rally once the markets allow for a more normal lending situation," he said in a note.   </p>

</div><div class="author">By Alex Frangos   </div><div>444 words</div><div>25 October 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of U.S. commercial-construction activity -- which had remained strong despite a sharp contraction in housing -- is showing signs of slowing and could drop next year for the first time since the early part of the decade, the latest sign that companies are turning cautious about the economy's prospects.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a closely watched report expected to be released today,  <span class="companylink">McGraw-Hill</span> Construction will forecast that spending on commercial and manufacturing buildings such as offices, warehouses and hotels, will decline 7% next year, in dollar volume, and 10% in the number of square feet of space built. That will be a sharp turnaround from this year, when commercial and manufacturing construction is expected to end the year up 11%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strength in the commercial sector up until now had been offsetting the decline in the housing market. That appears to be changing, though continued growth in institutional construction, such as universities and hospitals, and road construction will provide somewhat of a balance. The pattern of having one sector up while the others were down "has been moderating force," says Robert A. Murray, vice president for economic affairs at  <span class="companylink">McGraw-Hill</span> Construction, a unit of  <span class="companylink">McGraw-Hill Cos.</span>, a New York-based publisher.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All construction spending, including residential construction, is expected to shrink 2% next year, compared with a decline of 8% this year. The smaller total projections for next year indicate that  <span class="companylink">McGraw-Hill</span> believes the sharp declines in residential spending may be moderating. This year, for example, spending on single-family home construction is expected to drop 25%, but just 6% next year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Firms are taking note of the slower economy this year and expected slowness in 2008 and are adjusting their construction plans accordingly," Mr. Murray says. Slower job growth could dampen demand for new office space while retail builders pull back in the face of a slowdown in housing, a key driver in demand for new shopping centers and strip malls. Hotel builders are seeing a glut forming after three years of heated lodging construction.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are indications that this summer's credit crunch and the tightening of lending standards will put a damper on plans for real-estate expansion, especially among commercial real-estate developers and companies that are intensive users of real estate. "We are also seeing the effect of tighter lending conditions that support commercial building," Mr. Murray says.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The  <span class="companylink">McGraw-Hill</span> numbers are based on building-permit data it gathers from U.S. local governments. Those permits are an indicator of future construction spending.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing Slide:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Same Story,</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second Act</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trouble in the credit markets this summer appears to have sparked fresh declines in housing. This week's reports on home sales will help to measure this second swoon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists estimate Americans sold their homes at an annual rate of 5.25 million units in September, down 16% from a year ago and down a breathtaking 27% from the September 2005 peak of 7.21 million units. In the 1990 housing downturn, sales fell 20%, peak to trough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data leading up to this report point to a bad number: Pending home sales, which measures the number of home-sale contracts signed but not yet closed, fell sharply in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's also possible that many sales contracts are getting torn up because stringent lending conditions are making it harder for buyers to get a mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another problem: A growing number of would-be sellers are upside down -- that is, what they owe on their house and closing costs exceeds what they'll get for their house -- and they don't have the money they need to bring to the table to close the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales data, coming out later in the week, could be equally grim. Last week, <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span> -- the largest builder in the U.S. by homes sold -- said its cancellation rate increased to 48% in the quarter ended Sept. 30, up from 38% in the previous quarter. <span class="companylink">Beazer Homes</span> said its cancellation rate swelled to 68% from the previous quarter's 36%, an increase it attributed "in large part to the pronounced tightening in the mortgage markets."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Horton and Beazer's troubles are extreme compared with what's happening in the broader housing market. But they give some indication of how many buyers have been walking away from deals lately. In short: A tough housing market is getting even tougher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energy's Expanding Chunk</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of Household Budgets</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When oil prices were shooting higher a couple of years ago, investors could take solace in one important fact. Energy costs accounted for a much smaller part of the typical household budget than it did back in the '70s, when energy prices were soaring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's still true, but a lot less true than it was a couple of years ago. Spending on energy accounted for 6.2% of consumer expenditures in the second quarter this year, up from 5.5% two years ago and well above an average of 4.5% in 2002, according to the Commerce Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At more than 6% of total spending, energy consumption is now at levels last seen in the late 1980s. It reached more than 9% in the early 1980s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, the economy looks more vulnerable to this latest round of oil price increases than it did a couple of years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's true that gasoline prices haven't risen as much as oil prices lately, providing some cushion for consumers. But that might not last. Gasoline futures are up more than 30% from a year ago. Heating oil is up about 40%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The wallet of ever-resilient consumers might be up against its biggest test yet.</p>

</div><div class="author">COLLIN LEVY   </div><div>1799 words</div><div>20 October 2007</div><div>00:01</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2007 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CHICAGO--In his office high above the Chicago River, Sam Zell, the real estate virtuoso and master investor, is talking about motorcycles. "I have had accidents over the years," he says, "but most of them while standing still. I'm actually a very, very good driver." In case I look skeptical, he adds a sweetener, his wife's verdict: "Helen rides in the back with me and this is not Miss Bravery or something," he says. "But you know, she won't let me drive a car. I get distracted."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He's hoping I'll catch the broader point, which is about managing risk--the subject we're actually here to talk about. In his three-plus decades in the business, Mr. Zell has built a fortune doing deals in industries and business cycles where few were keen to tread. He's come out with levels of success that left others wondering how they failed to see the opportunities that were there, plain as day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most recent of these high-wire acts was his sale in February of <span class="companylink">Equity Office Properties</span>, the real estate investment trust he had built over decades, to Blackstone for $39 billion in cash. At the time, business publications were unconvinced. "Is he cashing out too early?" one headline asked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, as we now know, the sale was at the top of the market, and only months before the credit meltdown that has shaken up a financial system. So was he seeing portents of a tightening last winter that others weren't yet ready to acknowledge?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Obviously, the deal that was done on Feb. 7 could not be done on Sept. 7," Mr. Zell says, while insisting that he's told everyone he didn't try to deliberately pick a market top so much as weigh the offer against what his own instincts told him was the right price. "Somebody made an offer that was wide by a significant margin of my own valuation. So I'm looking in the mirror, and any day you don't sell, you buy, and I wasn't willing to buy at the price they were willing to pay, so I sold it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blackstone is likely to do fine, he notes, with a group of properties that spans the country from One Post Office Place in Boston to Columbia Center in Seattle, though perhaps not as fine as the enthusiasm of the time suggested. It remains to be seen what will happen in the near future, he explains. "I tend to think that the commercial real estate market is kind of flattening after an enormous amount of rate compression and a tremendous rise in costs over a relatively short period of time. It changed valuations quite dramatically in a relatively short period of time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He should know. The current illiquidity of the market may be a new experience for the young guns of real estate and private equity who got rich doing deals when money was cheap. Sam Zell, on the other hand, began to build his fortune in a market more similar to this one--buying distressed properties that no one wanted to get near. His M.O. during the early years earned him the nickname the Grave Dancer, and a reputation for nerves of steel. In the latter years, he observed that so much liquidity had entered the market, things would never be the same. So had things come full circle, I wondered? Could he end up back in the business he started in?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"An adequate description of me would certainly be a professional opportunist," he smiles, "I've always had my own perceptions of value, and I've always been willing to go forward and risk my own capital on whatever basis I believed. And on many of those occasions, it was really lonely. You turn around and look behind you and there's nobody else."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he and his partner began buying distressed assets in the late 1980s and early '90s, they had hardly any competition. Many of the buildings were so empty they became known as "see-throughs," and most savvy investors would have sooner jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge than touched some of their early acquisitions. "You know, you can really be a macho guy," he says, "but in the end, you think, well, 'I'm sure I'm right, aren't I?' But I was always pretty sure I was right."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To hear him tell it, once he had assessed the risk, it was just a matter of time--the point is how to think about the risks you take, as well as the ones you don't. To this end, Mr. Zell has helped establish a center for the study of risk at Northwestern University in the Chicago area, a project inspired by his own experience teaching an undergraduate course on risk at the University of Michigan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Going into it, he says, he wanted to teach a "Noah's Ark Class"--not just business students but students from all departments, English, architecture, math and so on. "I was intrigued by the way people take all kinds of risk all the time and don't know it," he says. "See, I'm a professional risk taker, but I'm a professional risk taker who understands all the risks he takes. A lot of people don't."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same economic principles cross all boundaries, he says. "Other than designing rocket engines, or biotech or some high-tech stuff, business is business and risk is risk. And the ability to incur risk and the ability to make things happen, they are all the same."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the current market, it's the fear of unseen risks that's on people's minds. As a condition of the interview, I've agreed not to ask about his landmark Chicago Tribune deal, but Mr. Zell isn't completely without his own exposure. Many now think the deal will have to be junked or rebuilt. Judging by the spread between his offer price of $34 a share and the current price of around $26 a share, the market is still questioning whether it is going to happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So we're talking about whether, when, and if the credit markets will get back to normal. He pauses and gets up. "Let me answer your question a different way," he says, heading over to a shelf along a bank of windows, where a row of decorative music boxes sits. These are Mr. Zell's famous music boxes--he's known for sending them to friends and business associates around the holidays. Each one contains a message and a song, on themes ranging from politics to the world economy. As he tells it, after getting chocolates or oranges ever holiday seasons, "the idea that I should send someone a calendar with my name on it was just beyond my measure." Instead, he sent economic forecasting machines disguised as music boxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He sets one whirring to life. The song it emits, to the tune of "Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head," begins "Capital is raining on my head / Everything is liquid / we're awash in cash to spend . . ."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's how he saw things in 2005. What has changed now is not the existence of liquidity--there's plenty--but the will to use it. The problem isn't a sudden lack of money, but a lack of confidence from the people who control it. Resurrecting that confidence will be the key, and it's unlikely to happen in the near-term. That said, while credit panics may not be anyone's idea of fun, their benefit is that they begin to restore some sanity and caution, keeping the animal spirits in balance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We haven't even begun to see the fraud that went on here," he continues, pausing to put on his best Professor Risk face. Imagine you're a broker on a starter home in California and it's a $500,000 loan to a guy who makes maybe $45,000 a year, he says, and someone just changes the numbers and the loan goes through. "Two days later, some investor in Poland owns it. You're out. You got your money. . . . What disciplines you?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So did we get carried away with the notion of homeownership as part of the American dream? "If you need to come up with some kind of a really sophisticated journalistic approach, I think what you could basically conclude is that the country can't afford more than 65% homeownership, and that when we start pushing . . . you create a disaster. You push a bunch of people who can't afford it into the homeownership dream, you have builders overbuilding, you have brokers overselling and it always ends up badly."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But don't jump out the window just yet. Mr. Zell sees some homeowners taking double-digit losses because they're forced to sell, but many won't sell if they don't get their price. And as long as employment holds up, he says, the housing market may be soft for many months to come, but there won't be a national fire sale. He also notes the oversupply is worse in some markets than others. Miami was hit badly, while cities like Seattle and New York have carried on with hardly a dip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The public-policy arena has now turned to efforts to protect the subprime borrowers from over-easy credit in the future. But the machinations of political types don't seem of much interest to Mr. Zell, whose office greets visitors with life-size statues of porcine bureaucrats--one wrapped in red tape and the other doing a six-legged "bureaucratic shuffle." "It would be unfortunate if this also became a political football," he says, "but to be honest with you, it's just like publicity-seeking political committees . . . they always look for a scapegoat, and they always look for victims. No matter what the subject matter is."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To get away from it all, there's always Zell's Angels, his very own motorcycle gang that takes trips around the world together, most recently riding the Dalmatian Coast from Trieste to Albania and back. Mr. Zell has about 15 motorcycles for his purposes, he says, but they're all the same basic kind, he tells me--sport bikes--fast and with a lot of torque. He knows exactly what he's dealing with. "I'm about as focused a motorcycle rider as you have ever seen."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. consumer prices rose modestly last month, suggesting that while some inflation risks linger, they probably wouldn't stand in the way of any interest-rate reductions needed to keep economic growth on track.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer prices rose 0.3% in September, reversing August's 0.1% decline, the Labor Department said. Core consumer prices, which exclude volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.2% for a fourth straight month.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, U.S. Federal Reserve officials appear more worried about the economic fallout from the U.S. housing slump than they are about inflation, and new data on housing starts may add to those concerns. In September, U.S. home builders slowed groundbreakings to the weakest pace in 14 years, the Commerce Department said yesterday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall consumer prices were up 2.8% from a year earlier, while the core measure was up 2.1%, unchanged from August's rate and near the 2% top end of the Fed's perceived comfort zone for annual core inflation. The Fed's preferred gauge of inflation, the core price index for personal consumption expenditures, is within that range at 1.8% annual growth through August.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though consumer prices are expected to rebound this month amid a rise in oil prices, the latest data should give Fed officials flexibility if they determine that more rate cuts are needed to limit the fallout from the housing crunch.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, the Fed lowered the federal-funds rate for the first time in more than four years, by a half percentage point to 4.75%, even though officials cautioned that "some inflation risks remain" and that they "will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there's still reason for concern. Though annual core inflation is just 2.1%, over the past three months it has risen at a 2.5% annualized rate, according to Wednesday's report. And higher oil prices could still filter through to core prices.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September, housing starts plunged 10% to a seasonally adjusted 1.191 million annual rate, after falling 3.2% in August to 1.327 million, the Commerce Department said. The department originally said August housing starts fell 2.6% to an annualized 1.331 million. Last month's housing starts were down 31% from a year earlier.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A key indicator suggested an even lower level of groundbreakings in the future. Building permits fell 7.3% last month to a 1.226 million annual rate in September -- the lowest pace since 1.174 million in July 1993.   </p>

</div><div class="author">By Kelly Evans, Sudeep Reddy and Greg Ip </div><div>670 words</div><div>18 October 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing slump is deepening, and businesses nationwide remain wary of it spilling over to other sectors, according to a roundup of reports to the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed's "beige book" survey of businesses from around the country reinforced government data released yesterday that showed a plunge in new-home construction and building permits last month, even as inflation stabilized. The data suggest the Fed's decision on what to do with interest rates at its next meeting -- Oct. 30-31 -- remains a close call.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Futures markets put the chances of a quarter-percentage-point cut in the Fed's short-term interest-rate target at about 50-50. Many economists argue the Fed will leave its target at the current 4.75% as financial markets have shown some improvement since the summer's credit crunch and there has been little significant spillover yet from the housing downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the continued uncertainty surrounding the broader outlook -- and the risk that the economy could turn in a much weaker performance should those spillovers occur -- suggest that a rate cut will get consideration as insurance against a recession. In the other direction, a few Fed officials appear uneasy even with last month's half-point rate cut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another factor that the Fed will have to weigh is inflation. The Labor Department said yesterday that high food and energy costs pushed September inflation to a six-month high, with the consumer-price index rising 2.8% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The "core" price index, which excludes the volatile food and energy components, rose a slim 0.22% in September. Its 2.1% increase from September 2006 remains within the zone that most Fed officials are said to be comfortable with over the long run. Still, economists are watching for signs that food and energy will push up other prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Core inflation has fallen steadily this year from 2.7% in February. That gave the Fed the latitude it needed to cut interest rates when credit markets seized up over the summer. While the latest report shows that the decline has stalled for now, it doesn't hint at a reversal as of yet, and thus it isn't likely to be a major factor in the Fed's rate decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The September plunge in housing starts -- which fell 10.2% from August -- reflected a 36% decline in starts for multifamily units, the Commerce Department said. Single-family units were down just 1.7% from August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Permits dropped 7.3% in September, indicating that the housing market faces further declines. Permits for single-family units, which typically lead new construction by about one month, sank 7.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists consider declining home construction necessary given waning demand and burgeoning inventories of unsold homes. But the housing slump, which has pushed down home prices, is threatening to restrain household consumption. The Fed's latest beige book reported modest economic expansion across the U.S., while also painting a bleak picture of a housing sector struggling with slower sales, softening prices, declining construction activity and tightening lending standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed report included early signs that the housing mess may be affecting other sectors -- including Internet-services, advertising and auto sales. "The only people buying are the 'need' buyers, not the 'want' buyers," a West Virginia dealer told the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The job market remains tight across much of the country. The Fed report said labor shortages for many occupations -- from professional and technical positions to lower-skilled retail and hospitality jobs -- were restraining economic activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Social Security Administration announced that Social Security benefits, which are received by 50 million Americans, will rise 2.3% next year, the smallest gain in four years. The cost-of-living increase was determined by the July-to-September inflation numbers. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Office Market Is Solid Despite Housing Slump</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Miami has been hit hard by the housing bust, and the condominium construction cranes still dotting the skyline signal the worst is yet to come because more supply is on its way, the housing problems haven't spread to the city's commercial real-estate market so far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Office vacancies are stable at near all-time lows, industrial space is hard to find, and Miami, which doesn't have a glut of shopping centers, is one of the few cities in the U.S. that can claim to be "under-retailed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The commercial market is as hot as it's ever been," says Jon Bourbeau, a senior managing director at Newmark Knight Frank, a commercial real-estate services firm based in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the downturn in Miami's housing sector has the industry on alert. In August, sales of single-family homes fell 45% from a year earlier, while median prices still rose 4%, the Florida Association of Realtors says. Condominium sales and prices made similar moves in August, with prices up 5% and sales down 44%. In a market that already has a 36-month supply of units, more than 24,000 condos are expected to come onto the market by 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're obviously concerned about [housing], but at the current time we're still seeing strong, steady growth" in commercial real estate, says Scott Strickland, a senior vice president in Miami at <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle Inc.</span>, a commercial real-estate services firm based in Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Loretta H. Cockrum is so confident in the office market that she is building a 600,000-square-foot office tower in the Brickell area of downtown -- without having an anchor tenant. "Miami's not much of a prelease market," says Ms. Cockrum, chief executive of Foram Group Inc., a real-estate company based in Miami. A second phase will add an upscale hotel and more office space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brickell Financial Centre is one of three major office towers being built in and around the city's downtown. That raises the specter of an office space glut when the buildings open in late 2009 or early 2010. Combined, the trio will drop 1.7 million square feet in one year on a market that normally absorbs only about 300,000 square feet a year. In addition, some sites that were slated for residential projects not long ago are being switched to commercial uses, Mr. Bourbeau says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That will mean an increased office-vacancy rate and will ease upward pressure on rents, which have been rising at an annual pace of 11%. For now, demand for top-notch space in downtown is still high, says Scott Sime, a managing director in Miami for <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis Group Inc.</span>, a commercial real-estate services firm based in Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Miami's central business districts have been spared, the area's suburbs have been hit harder. Data from Newmark Knight Frank that include Palm Beach and Broward Counties in addition to Miami-Dade County show vacancies increased to 10.3% in the third quarter from 8.8% a year earlier. The third quarter marked the second time in a year that the three counties combined saw a decline in occupied space. </p>
