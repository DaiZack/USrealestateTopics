<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. unexpectedly climbed last month, but prices continued dropping as the housing sector fights to gather steam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales increased by 1.4% in October from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.97 million, the National Association of Realtors said Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had expected home sales to fall by 2.2% to an annual rate of 4.80 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The small increase followed a decline in September sales, which were revised slightly downward to 4.90 million per year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home sales are moving sideways," said Lawrence Yun, the trade group's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales were up 13.5% from the same month a year earlier. But demand has been weakened by a soft economy, high unemployment, tight lending standards, and an uncertainty about the direction of prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report showed the median sales price in October was $162,500, down 4.7% from $170,600 a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An unhealthy level of unsold homes has prevented owners from raising prices. The inventory of previously owned homes listed for sale slid down at the end of October to 3.33 million. That represented an 8.0-month supply at the current sales pace, compared with a healthy level of about six months. "Inventories continue to make steady progress," Mr. Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A tide of foreclosures driven by the recession and financial crisis pushed up inventories. Foreclosures and other distressed properties represented about 28% of sales last month, the Realtors group said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who are buying often opt for distressed property and other previously owned homes because of the pricetags. New-home sales are way off their peak and builder confidence in the market is historically low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing price bubble began deflating more than five years ago, and the industry has been struggling to recover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy is discouraging buying and selling. Even though interest rates are low, a high rate of joblessness and tighter credit requirements are pressuring new mortgage applications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors' report said home sales rose last month compared with a month earlier in three out of four regions. Sales rose 4.4% in the West, 2.1% in the South, and 2.8% in the Midwest but fell 5.1% in the Northeast.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's thrifty consumers have not been major contributors to its remarkable growth story. With almost half of household wealth tied up in property, will falling home prices make China consume even less? Probably not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First up, China's households tend to purchase their property with cash rather than credit. In the U.S., the ratio of mortgage debt to GDP rose to 103% in 2007. In China, households' long-term loans to GDP were just 16% at the end of 2010. A fall in property prices in the U.S. bankrupted families who had borrowed against the value of their home. The same will not be true in China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's households might not be broke, but if the value of their property falls they will feel poorer. Will that dent consumption? That was certainly the case in the U.S., where personal consumption fell through 2008 and into the first half of 2009. But maybe not in China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property accounts for about 45% of Chinese households' assets, with bank deposits making up most of the rest. A fall in real estate prices of, say, 20% would knock about 9% off household wealth. That sounds extreme. But consider that in 2008, when a collapse in the equity markets wiped out around 7% of household wealth, retail sales notched up real growth of 17% for the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For young professionals and others aiming to jump onto the first rung of the property ladder, falling prices might even boost consumption. China's households save with a target in mind. For some, that might be enough cash to retire in comfort; for others, enough to buy a home. A fall in house prices would naturally reduce the amount of saving required to get on the housing ladder, freeing up funds for consumption.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling house prices bring risks to China's growth, and a sharp correction that crunches investment and dents employment would change the game. But a moderate fall in prices might not hurt household consumption—it could even give it a boost.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is starting to show a pulse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the first time in a long time, housing figures are coming in better than expected. The National Association of Home Builders' sentiment index jumped three points this month to 20, its highest reading in over a year. Last week, the Commerce Department said building permits and construction of single-family homes rose in October. The Federal Reserve's fourth-quarter loan survey showed a pickup in demand for mortgage loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission accomplished? Not quite. Construction is picking up but remains at historically depressed levels, and broader sales activity is still anemic. Indeed, the National Association of Realtors' existing-home sales report, out Monday, is likely to show a second straight monthly decline in October to a seasonally adjusted annualized pace of about 4.8 million units. That would mean the sales rate has dropped by more than 10% so far this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the foreclosure supply is ticking back up. After declining for three straight quarters, the percentage of loans on which foreclosure action has started rose in the third quarter, the Mortgage Bankers Association's latest survey showed. This was partly due to remediation programs and the sunset of earlier foreclosure halts, the group said. The continued trickle of distressed properties is likely to keep downward pressure on home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all foreclosures are created equal, however, and regional disparities are becoming more pronounced. In states with nonjudicial foreclosures, like California, properties are seized and resold more quickly than in judicial states like Florida, where court hearings can delay this for months, if not years. California's market, having fallen hard and fast early on, is now starting to recover. Florida, which also fell sharply, remains among the weakest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Bank of America</span><span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span> economists expect the foreclosure process to speed up in nonjudicial states next year, with liquidations peaking in 2013. This is partly why they expect home prices to drop another 8% on average nationwide over the next 18 months before bottoming. This assumes a healthy pickup in sales; if customers shy away because of economic angst or tighter lending criteria, a rebound will take longer to materialize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, six years after existing-home sales peaked, the market is at least edging toward a bottom. The biblical notion that seven years of famine follows seven years of feast may have something to it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHOENIX—The Phoenix housing market is defying conventional economic theory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories of homes for sale are low, falling 41% to 21,304 in October, compared to 35,732 at the same time a year ago for Greater Phoenix, according to the Cromford Report, a market research firm in Mesa, Ariz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of home sales is rising—to 6,428 in October from 5,443 in same month a year ago, according to the Cromford Report. The city's unemployment rate is inching down and is below the national average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The laws of supply and demand suggest housing prices should be rising, or at least stop falling. But they continue to decline, due to a flood of bargain-hunting investors who still dominate the market, as well as conservative bank appraisals. As a result, economic recovery in what was once one of the country's most dynamic cities is being held back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The monthly median price for a previously owned, single-family home in Greater Phoenix sank 5% to $120,000 in October from $127,500 a year earlier. The national median was $165,400 in September, the latest month reported by the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the same time, as prices weakened, unit sales rose 18%, according to the Cromford Report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That compares with a 3.5% decline in median prices nationally on a 12.2% increase in sales in the 12-month period ended in September, according to the latest data from the Realtors group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, median prices here have declined year-over-year for the past 12 months, while the annual change in unit sales has been climbing monthly since last November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The low-water mark for the market came in January 2010, when the median price for a home in the city of Phoenix fell 64% to $92,000 from $253,000 in December 2007, according to the Cromford Report. In October, the median returned to $92,000 in the city of Phoenix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Active home listings on the Greater Phoenix market fell to a 3.3-month supply in October from 6.6 months the same time a year ago, according to the research firm. An inventory supply of 4.5 months is considered normal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When inventories fall so rapidly in a market, housing experts say prices almost always rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It defies gravity what's going on here," says Alan Langston, executive director for the Arizona Real Estate Investors Association, an industry trade group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, there was a 8.5-month supply in September, the latest reporting period, down from 10.7 months a year ago, according to the Realtors group. The consensus for a national housing recovery is at least four years away, according to a September survey of economists, real estate experts and others in the industry by MacroMarkets LLC, an investment banking service in Madison, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing experts attribute the disconnect in Phoenix primarily to the fact the once-booming metropolis was among the most severely hit markets. Between 2007 and 2010, home prices fell more than in almost any other market. That has prompted a surge in sales over the past year that has largely been driven by investors seeking bargain-basement prices, said Mike Orr, owner of the Cromford Report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Investors are 40% to 50% of the market now and they focus mainly on the bottom end," said Mr. Orr, who added that another weight on prices is what he calls stricter lending standards and low bank appraisals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Broker Dan Valentine said that between March and September he paid $1 million on behalf of a group of investors for 16 homes that were valued at $2.7 million before the recession. He recently inspected a 1,480-square-foot house in suburban Glendale once valued at $235,000 that was listed by its bank owner for $75,500. Mr. Valentine placed a bid of $43,750 on it in September but lost out to a bid of $78,880.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Is the neighborhood pretty nice?" Mr. Valentine asked former owner Donna Grannis y cellphone. "It's not bad," said the 46-year-old Ms. Grannis, a single mother of two who later added she fell behind on her $181,000 mortgage. "Things just spiraled down for me."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Valentine's strategy is to buy houses like these on behalf of mostly out-of-state investors and rent them until the market returns. For investors like Gerald Jackson, a retired construction manager in Springfield, Mo., a return of as much as 10% from rent beats many investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's risk, but there doesn't seem to be a lot of risk because these houses are so cheap," said the 68-year-old Mr. Jackson, who in October paid $75,000 for a 2,000-square-foot house in Phoenix whose owner had defaulted on a $168,000 mortgage. The house hasn't been rented yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the nonconstruction economy on the mend, apartment vacancies have eased from 13.3% in December 2009 to 9% as of August, according to a September report by the brokerage firm <span class="companylink">Cushman &amp; Wakefield Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Broker Joan Levinson said that in July she sold a house in upscale Paradise Valley for $1 million—but the bank wouldn't allow the buyer to pay more than an appraisal that came in at $925,000. "The seller was not happy," Ms. Levinson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The low prices are putting the brakes on recovery in a crucial economic contributor: construction of new homes. In October, just 339 new homes were built in the Phoenix area compared with about 4,000 in September 2006 at the height of a building frenzy in 2006, according to Information Market, an industry research report in Glendale, Ariz. "We're kind of in this recurring nightmare that doesn't want to fix itself," said Howard Weinstein, principal of Pacific Land Co., a land broker in Scottsdale, Ariz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dearth of new construction is also holding back the recovery of other once-booming southwestern cities such as Las Vegas, where the general economies remain slow. But inventories remain higher in Las Vegas than in Phoenix: a 5.5-month supply in October, down from 6.6 months a year ago, according to the Greater Las Vegas Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lack of home construction is particularly striking in Phoenix, where other key industries such as technology have resumed their growth, helping Phoenix's unemployment rate fall to 8.2% in September from 9% in the year-earlier month, under the 9% national rate.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calabasas, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last Friday, about 60 people gathered at a 10,300-square-foot French Chateau-style home in a gated community of this wealthy suburb of Los Angeles. Nibbling on fruit salad and croissants, the visitors meandered through the home's large kitchen, checked out the view of the rolling hills or peeked into the movie theater with stadium seating while it played "Pretty in Pink."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They had all gathered to see this seven-bedroom, seven-bath mansion, which was rented by singer Britney Spears between roughly 2008 and 2010, sell to the highest bidder. The home had previously been on the market for as much as $10.8 million; bidding would start at $4.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm starting to get butterflies," confessed Regina Leon, who owns the home with her husband Jose "Pancho" Leon, a builder and founder of a money-order company. After several of her girlfriends mentioned they were coming by, Ms. Leon had decided at the last minute to cancel her hair appointment to stay to watch the action unfold. Mr. Leon said he wasn't worried, though he admitted he'd gotten only about four hours of sleep the night before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once considered a last resort for desperate sellers or for banks unloading foreclosed properties, home auctions are increasingly being used to sell penthouse apartments, waterfront mansions and grand country estates—many of them languishing in an uncertain market after significant price cuts. At Premiere Estates Auction Co., founded 10 years ago, the average price of a home the company auctions is up nearly 40% from a year or so ago, says auctioneer Anthony Fitzgerald. Gadsden, Ala.-based auction company JP King, in business since 1915, has seen inquiries for home auctions above $10 million so far this year double from a couple of years ago, said Craig King, the company's president. In 2010, the company had 11 inquiries for homes above $10 million; so far this year it's had 24.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the housing slump drags on, the carrying costs of waiting out the market have become onerous, even for the wealthiest. A seller who put a home on the market in 2009 hoping that a turnaround was on the horizon may now be realizing that it could take several years or more for the market to rebound. Taxes on a $10 million or $20 million home can run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, in addition to staffing, landscaping and other upkeep. The ultra high-end of the market is particularly vulnerable: As of September, houses priced at $10 million and above declined nearly 9.5% in value from last year, according to Zillow, the online housing tracker, compared to a 4.4% decline overall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Eventually, even the people who have unlimited means will throw in the towel at some point," said George Graham, the CEO of Concierge Auctions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some brokers warn that when a well-known mansion or estate fails to sell at auction, it can become tarnished, making it harder to sell in the future. "If you have all that hype and then it doesn't sell, then you've got egg on your face," said Jeffrey Hyland, president of Beverly Hills-based real-estate firm Hilton &amp; Hyland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bob Hurwitz, a longtime Southern California broker who recently tried unsuccessfully to auction off a $45 million sculptural-style home in La Jolla known as "the Razor," said he's concluded the process doesn't benefit sellers, who assume all the risk by paying marketing fees up front. (Fees can range anywhere from a couple thousand dollars to upwards of $150,000 for ultra high-end homes.) He said auctions can also turn off potential buyers who don't want to pay an additional 8% to 12% in premiums after the sale, which can amount to a million dollars or more for an expensive home. "It just doesn't make sense," he said. Laura Brady, of Concierge Auctions, said most buyers are aware that all real-estate transactions involve fees, and the premiums are included in auction-sale prices, "just like real estate agent's fees" are in a traditional sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mansions and estates are frequently auctioned for much less than their previous price tags, though those price tags may have been set unrealistically high to begin with. While both art-auction houses Christie's and <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> are affiliated with real-estate companies, neither conducts real-estate auctions in the U.S. (Both have some affiliate agencies that have auction divisions which partner with companies like Concierge and Premiere Estates.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christie's International Real Estate's CEO Neil Palmer said in an e-mail that while such auctions are common in parts of Asia and in Australia, the company doesn't view them as the best way for sellers to get the best price in the U.S., because when sales happen they are "more often than not at a steep discount."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. King from J.P. King, on the other hand, said that homes generally sell for steep discounts in today's real-estate market even when they're not sold at auction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last November, Maureen Coen, who works in fixed income for a financial company, heard about the upcoming auction of a home in her neighborhood in Tuxedo Park, N.Y., one morning and decided to show up. (Concierge Auctions, which handled the sale, says usually 48 hours advance notice is required to qualify.) She won the house for $2.3 million—75% less than its original list price of $9.8 million. "I got phone calls that weekend [from friends] telling me I got the deal of the century," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A historic New Canaan, Conn., estate with a 16,000-square-foot main house, a carriage house and three-bedroom guest cottage once priced at $22 million is coming up for auction next month with a starting bid and minimum reserve of $6.8 million—or nearly 70% off. Bronko Terkovich, a real-estate developer and architect in Jackson Hole, Wyo., plans to auction off his property there on Dec. 10. His 10,000-square-foot home was listed for $16 million in 2009; the reserve, or minimum sale price, is just under $6 million. "We wanted it to have a reasonable low-level price to attract the greatest spectrum of possible buyers," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, Sheldon Good &amp; Co. auctioned the 56-acre Napa Valley estate of the late winemaker and philanthropist Robert Mondavi, with bidding starting off at $13.9 million in a sealed-bid sale; the property came on the market in May 2010 for $25 million. The company said several bids were submitted by the deadline and are still being reviewed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the average price of homes hitting the auction block ticks upward, a handful of companies have cropped up to handle such sales. Auction.com, which sells distressed real estate online, recently launched a luxury division. Jeff Biebuyck and Karen Baldwin, two <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> agents who had the Leons' Calabasas listing, are launching an auction division of their traditional brokerage business, as has Jon Kohler, whose Georgia firm specializes in selling multimillion-dollar historic plantation properties in the South. John McMonigle, an Orange County, Calif., real-estate broker known for his trophy-home listings, has spun off an auction division called M Lux Exchange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Auction companies argue that they can reach a wider pool of buyers than local brokers. They also say an auction announcement can create a sense of urgency that's impossible to replicate in the buyer's markets of today. "In this market, buyers think they can wait three months," said Roger Ewing, the president of Ewing &amp; Associates <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The challenge for these companies is to aggressively market expensive-to-build, sometimes one-of-a-kind homes that will likely sell for steeply discounted prices without making it feel like a fire sale. Mr. McMonigle said his open-house events usually include Champagne and live music. "We want to perceived as that type of luxury experience," he said. "We're approaching it much like <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> would approach the sale of art." Brochures are often sent directly to high net worth potential buyers, or their brokers. Ads are placed online, in national newspapers or glossy luxury magazines in the U.S. and, sometimes, as far away as Brazil or China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the day of the sale, generally only qualified bidders who have transferred money into an escrow account, or brought a cashier's check, are invited, along with local brokers and, sometimes, neighbors. Hors d'oeuvres are sometimes served along with tea, coffee or Champagne. Concierge says at its Hawaii auctions, bidders are given floral leis. Mr. Fitzgerald of Premiere said that for morning sales, he likes to serve donuts and coffee to energize the crowd. The podium is generally placed to maximize the home's best views.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Leon said he didn't immediately consider an auction when he listed the Calabasas home for $10.8 million in 2007, after his wife concluded it was too big for their family of five. But after about two years and a price cut to $7.9 million, Mr. Leon decided to auction the home with Premiere. "It's the entrepreneurial way of selling," he said. Regina, his wife, eventually agreed, though she initially didn't like having to explain to neighbors that their home was not in foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With several dozen people gathered around a podium under a white tent, the auctioneer warmed up the crowd, getting them to sing the national anthem (it was Veterans Day) and conducting a mock auction that included bidding on Disneyland (a little girl in pigtails won). Then the bidding for the home began. The minimum bid of $4.5 million was quickly offered. Someone on the phone with an auction-company representative initially appeared to have the highest offer—$5.5 million—beating out about four others who showed up in person. After a minute or two of trying to rouse a counter bid from the crowd, the auctioneer banged his gavel on the podium and announced the home had sold, subject to seller confirmation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It hadn't—$5.5 million wasn't high enough to meet the reserve, the minimum amount the Leons were willing to sell the home for. After most of the crowd had left, a neighbor who had been the runner-up in live bidding negotiated a $5.9 million purchase, including auction-company fees. The buyer, Dan Hosseni, owns Pizza Hut franchises across the state. He and his wife, Nancy, walked around the backyard with their 4-year-old daughter (the Disneyland winner) discussing plans to expand the dining room to accommodate their large extended family. "This is a house [my wife] and I are going to grow old in," Mr. Hosseni said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the sale has still yet to be finalized, Mr. Leon said he was happy. "It gives me an opportunity to move forward," he said.</p>

The ultra high-end of the market is particularly vulnerable: As of September, houses priced at $10 million and above declined nearly 9.5% in value from last year, according to Zillow, the online housing tracker, compared to a 4.4% decline overall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Eventually, even the people who have unlimited means will throw in the towel at some point," said George Graham, the CEO of Concierge Auctions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some brokers warn that when a well-known mansion or estate fails to sell at auction, it can become tarnished, making it harder to sell in the future. "If you have all that hype and then it doesn't sell, then you've got egg on your face," said Jeffrey Hyland, president of Beverly Hills-based real-estate firm Hilton &amp; Hyland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bob Hurwitz, a longtime Southern California broker who recently tried unsuccessfully to auction off a $45 million sculptural-style home in La Jolla known as "the Razor," said he's concluded the process doesn't benefit sellers, who assume all the risk by paying marketing fees up front. (Fees can range anywhere from a couple thousand dollars to upwards of $150,000 for ultra high-end homes.) He said auctions can also turn off potential buyers who don't want to pay an additional 8% to 12% in premiums after the sale, which can amount to a million dollars or more for an expensive home. "It just doesn't make sense," he said. Laura Brady, of Concierge Auctions, said most buyers are aware that all real-estate transactions involve fees, and the premiums are included in auction-sale prices, "just like real estate agent's fees" are in a traditional sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mansions and estates are frequently auctioned for much less than their previous price tags, though those price tags may have been set unrealistically high to begin with. While both art-auction houses Christie's and <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> are affiliated with real-estate companies, neither conducts real-estate auctions in the U.S. (Both have some affiliate agencies that have auction divisions which partner with companies like Concierge and Premiere Estates.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christie's International Real Estate's CEO Neil Palmer said in an e-mail that while such auctions are common in parts of Asia and in Australia, the company doesn't view them as the best way for sellers to get the best price in the U.S., because when sales happen they are "more often than not at a steep discount."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. King from J.P. King, on the other hand, said that homes generally sell for steep discounts in today's real-estate market even when they're not sold at auction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last November, Maureen Coen, who works in fixed income for a financial company, heard about the upcoming auction of a home in her neighborhood in Tuxedo Park, N.Y., one morning and decided to show up. (Concierge Auctions, which handled the sale, says usually 48 hours advance notice is required to qualify.) She won the house for $2.3 million -- 75% less than its original list price of $9.8 million. "I got phone calls that weekend [from friends] telling me I got the deal of the century," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A historic New Canaan, Conn., estate with a 16,000-square-foot main house, a carriage house and three-bedroom guest cottage once priced at $22 million is coming up for auction next month with a starting bid and minimum reserve of $6.8 million -- or nearly 70% off. Bronko Terkovich, a real-estate developer and architect in Jackson Hole, Wyo., plans to auction off his property there on Dec. 10. His 10,000-square-foot home was listed for $16 million in 2009; the reserve, or minimum sale price, is just under $6 million. "We wanted it to have a reasonable low-level price to attract the greatest spectrum of possible buyers," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, Sheldon Good &amp; Co. auctioned the 56-acre Napa Valley estate of the late winemaker and philanthropist Robert Mondavi, with bidding starting off at $13.9 million in a sealed-bid sale; the property came on the market in May 2010 for $25 million. The company said several bids were submitted by the deadline and are still being reviewed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the average price of homes hitting the auction block ticks upward, a handful of companies have cropped up to handle such sales. Auction.com, which sells distressed real estate online, recently launched a luxury division. Jeff Biebuyck and Karen Baldwin, two <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> agents who had the Leons' Calabasas listing, are launching an auction division of their traditional brokerage business, as has Jon Kohler, whose Georgia firm specializes in selling multimillion-dollar historic plantation properties in the South. John McMonigle, an Orange County, Calif., real-estate broker known for his trophy-home listings, has spun off an auction division called M Lux Exchange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Auction companies argue that they can reach a wider pool of buyers than local brokers. They also say an auction announcement can create a sense of urgency that's impossible to replicate in the buyer's markets of today. "In this market, buyers think they can wait three months," said Roger Ewing, the president of Ewing &amp; Associates <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The challenge for these companies is to aggressively market expensive-to-build, sometimes one-of-a-kind homes that will likely sell for steeply discounted prices without making it feel like a fire sale. Mr. McMonigle said his open-house events usually include Champagne and live music. "We want to perceived as that type of luxury experience," he said. "We're approaching it much like <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> would approach the sale of art." Brochures are often sent directly to high net worth potential buyers, or their brokers. Ads are placed online, in national newspapers or glossy luxury magazines in the U.S. and, sometimes, as far away as Brazil or China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the day of the sale, generally only qualified bidders who have transferred money into an escrow account, or brought a cashier's check, are invited, along with local brokers and, sometimes, neighbors. Hors d'oeuvres are sometimes served along with tea, coffee or Champagne. Concierge says at its Hawaii auctions, bidders are given floral leis. Mr. Fitzgerald of Premiere said that for morning sales, he likes to serve donuts and coffee to energize the crowd. The podium is generally placed to maximize the home's best views.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Leon said he didn't immediately consider an auction when he listed the Calabasas home for $10.8 million in 2007, after his wife concluded it was too big for their family of five. But after about two years and a price cut to $7.9 million, Mr. Leon decided to auction the home with Premiere. "It's the entrepreneurial way of selling," he said. Regina, his wife, eventually agreed, though she initially didn't like having to explain to neighbors that their home was not in foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With several dozen people gathered around a podium under a white tent, the auctioneer warmed up the crowd, getting them to sing the national anthem (it was Veterans Day) and conducting a mock auction that included bidding on Disneyland (a little girl in pigtails won). Then the bidding for the home began. The minimum bid of $4.5 million was quickly offered. Someone on the phone with an auction-company representative initially appeared to have the highest offer -- $5.5 million -- beating out about four others who showed up in person. After a minute or two of trying to rouse a counter bid from the crowd, the auctioneer banged his gavel on the podium and announced the home had sold, subject to seller confirmation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It hadn't -- $5.5 million wasn't high enough to meet the reserve, the minimum amount the Leons were willing to sell the home for. After most of the crowd had left, a neighbor who had been the runner-up in live bidding negotiated a $5.9 million purchase, including auction-company fees. The buyer, Dan Hosseni, owns Pizza Hut franchises across the state. He and his wife, Nancy, walked around the backyard with their 4-year-old daughter (the Disneyland winner) discussing plans to expand the dining room to accommodate their large extended family. "This is a house [my wife] and I are going to grow old in," Mr. Hosseni said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the sale has still yet to be finalized, Mr. Leon said he was happy. "It gives me an opportunity to move forward," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five years ago, it was too easy to get a mortgage in the U.S. Today, it's probably too hard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is frustrating Federal Reserve officials who see boulders in the mortgage market blocking the benefits of low interest rates from flowing through to the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders are offering 30-year fixed-rate mortgages below 4%. Compared to typical family incomes, houses are more affordable than in decades. Yet home sales are languishing. A National Association of Realtors' survey found 15% of real estate agents said their last contract didn't close because the buyer couldn't get a loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I turn away a buyer every 48 hours who would have been considered incredibly creditworthy...by my father and grandfather," says Louis Barnes, a third-generation lender now at Cherry Creek Mortgage Co. in Boulder, Colo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, mortgage brokers rarely celebrate the sagacity of banks or investors who ultimately buy mortgages. But data bolster Mr. Barnes's complaint. Fed surveys of bankers show they lifted the bar to making mortgages sharply during the panic of 2008 and 2009—not only for subprime borrowers, but for prime borrowers, those with good credit histories and sufficient income to cover their loans. Banks no longer are tightening standards, but very few have relaxed them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many Americans' credit scores have fallen because they were late in paying bills during the recession. That makes it hard for them to get a mortgage, but that's only part of the story. Lenders are demanding ever-higher credit scores. Having a good credit history isn't sufficient; one has to have a really good one to get a prime loan. "Roughly about the bottom third of people who might have qualified for a prime mortgage...a few years ago, cannot qualify today," Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said, with disapproval, a few months ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A return to the bad old days of "Ninja" mortgages—no income, no job, no assets—would be unwise and unwelcome. Making loans to those who have little prospect of paying them back is stupid and costly. Since we all now know that house prices can fall, "no down payment" loans are imprudent for borrower and lender. Mortgages were too easy to get in the mid-2000s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If some Americans can't get mortgages because they don't have steady jobs or down payments or agreed to pay for more than a house is reasonably worth, OK. But if the pendulum has swung so far that creditworthy borrowers are turned away, that does unnecessary harm to the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Obstacles to refinancing and access to credit for home purchases are limiting the support provided by low rates to house prices and consumption," William Dudley, president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, said recently. That, in turn, discourages would-be buyers and pushes down house prices. "Continued house price declines could lead to even more defaults, foreclosures and distress sales, undermining wealth, confidence and spending." He said "breaking this vicious cycle" is imperative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's the problem? Everyone from real estate agents to top Fed officials has a list. Credit scores, depressed by the recession, may not be reliable predictors of borrowers' ability to make payments. Appraisers are low-balling, overcompensating for past mistakes and struggling because there are so few truly comparable sales to value homes. Supervisors are making lenders overly cautious. A shrinking mortgage industry means more bottlenecks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One oft-cited reason: "They're afraid they'll have to buy back their loans," says Peter Ogilvie, a Santa Cruz, Calif., mortgage broker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bulk of mortgages made today are sold to or guaranteed by government entities <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span>. They bear the risk that the loan won't be paid back. All three took huge hits, and are trying to reduce losses by forcing lenders, originators and middlemen to take back loans that shouldn't have been made—because the borrower lied, the appraisal was inflated, the paperwork was irresponsibly sloppy. After all, why should taxpayers pay for sins of those who recklessly made bad loans?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if the agencies are scouring files to seek any excuse to send back loans that went bad not because of initial negligence or fraud but because, say, a borrower lost a job after five years of on-time payments, does that make sense? Or does it make lenders like doctors who order lots of extra tests out of fear of malpractice suits. Neither the individual nor society is well-served.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a big deal. Taking back one bad loan can wipe out a lender's profit on dozens of good ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Squeezing every nickel out of mortgage makers is sweet revenge, but if it leads them to make fewer new loans to worthy borrowers, it'll push home prices lower than they would otherwise be—and that hurts us all.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five years ago, it was too easy to get a mortgage in the U.S. Today, it's probably too hard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is frustrating Federal Reserve officials who see boulders in the mortgage market blocking the benefits of low interest rates from flowing through to the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders are offering 30-year fixed-rate mortgages below 4%. Compared to typical family incomes, houses are more affordable than in decades. Yet home sales are languishing. A National Association of Realtors' survey found 15% of real estate agents said their last contract didn't close because the buyer couldn't get a loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I turn away a buyer every 48 hours who would have been considered incredibly creditworthy . . . by my father and grandfather," says Louis Barnes, a third-generation lender now at Cherry Creek Mortgage Co. in Boulder, Colo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, mortgage brokers rarely celebrate the sagacity of banks or investors who ultimately buy mortgages. But data bolster Mr. Barnes's complaint. Fed surveys of bankers show they lifted the bar to making mortgages sharply during the panic of 2008 and 2009 -- not only for subprime borrowers, but for prime borrowers, those with good credit histories and sufficient income to cover their loans. Banks no longer are tightening standards, but very few have relaxed them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many Americans' credit scores have fallen because they were late in paying bills during the recession. That makes it hard for them to get a mortgage, but that's only part of the story. Lenders are demanding ever-higher credit scores. Having a good credit history isn't sufficient; one has to have a really good one to get a prime loan. "Roughly about the bottom third of people who might have qualified for a prime mortgage...a few years ago, cannot qualify today," Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said, with disapproval, a few months ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A return to the bad old days of "Ninja" mortgages -- no income, no job, no assets -- would be unwise and unwelcome. Making loans to those who have little prospect of paying them back is stupid and costly. Since we all now know that house prices can fall, "no down payment" loans are imprudent for borrower and lender. Mortgages were too easy to get in the mid-2000s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If some Americans can't get mortgages because they don't have steady jobs or down payments or agreed to pay for more than a house is reasonably worth, OK. But if the pendulum has swung so far that creditworthy borrowers are turned away, that does unnecessary harm to the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Obstacles to refinancing and access to credit for home purchases are limiting the support provided by low rates to house prices and consumption," William Dudley, president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, said recently. That, in turn, discourages would-be buyers and pushes down house prices. "Continued house price declines could lead to even more defaults, foreclosures and distress sales, undermining wealth, confidence and spending." He said "breaking this vicious cycle" is imperative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's the problem? Everyone from real estate agents to top Fed officials has a list. Credit scores, depressed by the recession, may not be reliable predictors of borrowers' ability to make payments. Appraisers are low-balling, overcompensating for past mistakes and struggling because there are so few truly comparable sales to value homes. Supervisors are making lenders overly cautious. A shrinking mortgage industry means more bottlenecks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One oft-cited reason: "They're afraid they'll have to buy back their loans," says Peter Ogilvie, a Santa Cruz, Calif., mortgage broker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bulk of mortgages made today are sold to or guaranteed by government entities <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span>. They bear the risk that the loan won't be paid back. All three took huge hits, and are trying to reduce losses by forcing lenders, originators and middlemen to take back loans that shouldn't have been made -- because the borrower lied, the appraisal was inflated, the paperwork was irresponsibly sloppy. After all, why should taxpayers pay for sins of those who recklessly made bad loans?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if the agencies are scouring files to seek any excuse to send back loans that went bad not because of initial negligence or fraud but because, say, a borrower lost a job after five years of on-time payments, does that make sense? Or does it make lenders like doctors who order lots of extra tests out of fear of malpractice suits. Neither the individual nor society is well-served.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a big deal. Taking back one bad loan can wipe out a lender's profit on dozens of good ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Squeezing every nickel out of mortgage makers is sweet revenge, but if it leads them to make fewer new loans to worthy borrowers, it'll push home prices lower than they would otherwise be -- and that hurts us all.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK—<span class="companylink">Lowe's Cos</span>.' fiscal-third-quarter earnings fell 44% as store-closing charges masked the home-improvement retailer's slightly improved same-store sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ricky Damron, <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> store-operations executive, told analysts during a conference call that same-store sales mostly improved as customers along the U.S. East Coast bought roofing products, dehumidifiers and cleaning supplies to prepare for and clean up flooding damage in the region. Large discretionary products, however, remained pressured.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our performance is not at the level we expect relative to the market," said President and Chief Executive Robert Niblock. He said the company is making changes to reduce the size of its organization and enhance the shopping experience. He added that <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> isn't dependent on "an unlikely near-term economic recovery."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Niblock said in an interview that because home prices remain weak, homeowners are cautious about initiating major renovation projects such as redoing their kitchens. He said the latest economic forecasts suggest home values will be challenged through 2012 and that prices won't rise again until 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Customers are saying, 'Why would I invest in this home until I know it'll be worth more in the future than it is today?'" Mr. Niblock said. He added that customers are more willing to spend money to upgrade a bathroom, replace appliances, paint, or make over a room and put in new flooring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bottom line of the second-largest U.S. home-improvement retailer has declined in recent quarters because of low consumer confidence and the slow recovery in the housing market. <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> has also faced higher costs for commodities such as lumber and fuel. In an effort to improve profitability, <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> is closing 20 stores, greatly slowing future openings and restructuring its store and merchandising organizations, including streamlining the divisional structure to 14 national regions from 21.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> has recently focused more on its Web presence, increasing the number of items it offers online, creating a Spanish-language site and launching a mobile app. The company has a splashy marketing push to tout "MyLowe's," an online tool that tracks a customer's purchase history and reminds users of seasonal needs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Excluding the impact of charges for store closings and discontinued projects, <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> now sees adjusted earnings for the full year of $1.57 to $1.60 a share on a 2% to 3% rise in sales. In August, it projected earnings of $1.54 to $1.60 a share on a sales increase of about 2%. <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> also forecast current-quarter earnings of 20 cents to 23 cents a share on 8% sales growth. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expect 23 cents on 7% revenue growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the quarter ended Oct. 28, <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> reported a profit of $225 million, or 18 cents a share, down from $404 million, or 29 cents, a year earlier. The most recent quarter included a 17-cent-a-share charge for store closings and discontinued projects. Sales jumped 2.3% to $11.85 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> August projection was per-share earnings of 30 cents to 33 cents on a roughly 2% sales increase, below analysts' estimates at the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gross margin fell to 34.1% from 35%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Same-store sales rose 0.7%, reflecting higher traffic and reversing declines in the two prior quarters. <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> same-store sales have been weaker than those of larger rival <span class="companylink">Home Depot Inc</span>. for nine consecutive quarters. <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> reports its third-quarter results Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Damron said inventories rose 5.2%, or $447 million, from a year ago, driven by an additional investment in holiday merchandise and the expansion of some product lines. He said that demand for winter-storm-related products last year outstripped supply so <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> was putting itself in a better position this winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares were up 1.69% to $23.50 in recent trading.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Robbie Whelan   </div><div>1002 words</div><div>15 November 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>10</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five years into a brutal national housing downturn, raw land destined for residential development has fallen so far in value that thousands of acres across the country are being used again for agriculture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the fast-moving days of the housing boom, real-estate speculators in California, Arizona, Florida and other states paid top dollar to buy land from farmers and convert it from citrus groves and cotton fields to potential subdivisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, with crop prices soaring and housing in a deep slump, the economics of land investment have turned upside down. Farmers and investors are buying land that had been slated for development and using it for agriculture. And they are paying a small fraction of what housing developers paid for the same land before the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend, if it continues, could represent a historic shift away from development in the far reaches of metropolitan areas. These properties had fueled much of the housing industry's bubble last decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September, the Vanderweys, an Arizona dairy farming family, paid $8 million for a 760-acre alfalfa and cotton field that had fallen into foreclosure in Buckeye, Ariz., about 30 miles west of Phoenix. That same parcel, called Liberty Farm, had been sold to real-estate speculators in 2005 for $40.8 million. The Vanderweys want to plant hay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These prices are becoming the new normal," said Nick Vanderwey, one of four brothers who purchased the farmland. "Everything in this area is coming back into farmers' hands."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, residential land values in the U.S. have fallen nearly 70% since peaking in the second quarter of 2006, according to a recent report by the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, a Cambridge, Mass., think tank. Meanwhile, the value of U.S. cropland (excluding Alaska and Hawaii) rose close to 20% between 2007 and 2011, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The demand for farmland is being fueled by rising prices for everything from corn to cotton. Net farm income is forecast to climb 31% in 2011 to $103.6 billion, its highest level on an inflation-adjusted basis since 1973, according to the USDA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Right now, people are working that land for whatever value it has, which usually means they're farming it or selling it to farmers," said Vernon Crowder, an economist with <span class="companylink">Rabobank International</span>, a major U.S. agricultural lender based in the Netherlands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These changing dynamics have turned farmers into land speculators and beneficiaries of the housing bust -- sometimes buying back the same land they had sold earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider the England family, which recently repurchased 430 acres of cotton fields in Eloy, Ariz. In 2004, the Englands had paid $731,000 for the parcel about 65 miles southeast of Phoenix. The family then flipped the property in 2009 to a Milwaukee-based apartment builder for $8.6 million. Two months ago, the family, which had been leasing the land to grow cotton, bought back the farm out of foreclosure for $1.75 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Putting residential land back under the plow reflects a major demographic shift. Since World War II, development has spread out from cities to suburbs and then to fringe areas known as exurbs. During the housing boom, builders poured hundreds of millions of dollars into land in the exurbs, where they built quick-and-easy tract homes and sold them to first-time buyers willing to commute long distances to employment centers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strategy worked as long as gasoline was cheap and jobs plentiful. Now, with gas prices above $3.40 a gallon, unemployment hovering around 9% and home values sinking, demand for new exurban houses has largely evaporated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's no foreseeable market for that housing in the future," said Christopher Leinberger, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who has written about land-pricing trends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between 2000 and 2007, the amount of land used for farms fell by two million to four million acres a year, according to USDA surveys. But since 2007, the conversion rate has slowed and the amount of land being farmed has held steady at 920 million acres.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Values of land once slated for housing also have fallen sharply in the Midwest, which didn't see the same big run-up in prices as California, Nevada and Arizona.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late May, a group of corn and soybean farmers bought 650 acres near Manteno, Ill., about 50 miles south of Chicago, that had fallen into foreclosure after the developer who owned it filed for bankruptcy. The land originally was purchased for $15,000 to $20,000 an acre for housing for Chicago-area commuters, according to brokers involved in the deal. It was sold by a bank this year to the farmers for $8,000 an acre.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The primary thing that was driving development here was people's desire and willingness to get out of the city," said Dean Retherford, the broker who negotiated the sale. "But development is over. It's done. . . It'll be 15-20 years before this land is developed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year in California, Paul Singh, who grows nut trees and grapes used for raisins, paid $27,600 an acre, or a total of $9 million, for 326 acres in Hanford in the San Joaquin Valley, one of the nation's largest farming regions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few years earlier, the land had been purchased for $82,800 an acre by <span class="companylink">Ennis Homes Inc</span>. of Porterville, Calif. It envisioned a development called Villagio, with nearly 1,500 homes along with a shopping center. Ennis filed for bankruptcy in 2010 due to falling land values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Singh plans to plant a wine-grape vineyard on the property and grow walnuts. He expects to net $800,000 to $1 million a year, roughly a 10% return on his land investment.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jason Gonsalves worked hard to turn his 6,500-square-foot stucco-and-stone home in the suburbs of Sacramento into the ultimate grown-up party pad, complete with game room, custom wine cellar and an infinity-edge pool overlooking Folsom Lake. When interest rates fell recently, Mr. Gonsalves, who runs a lobbying firm, looked into refinancing his $750,000 mortgage. That's when he got startling news—the home had dropped more than $200,000 in value while he was renovating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or at least, that's what one real-estate website told him. Another valued the house at only $640,500. And these online estimates left him all the more confused when a real-life appraiser, assessing the house for the refinancing loan, pinned its value at $1.5 million. "I have no idea how those numbers could be so different," Mr. Gonsalves says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right or wrong, they're the numbers millions of consumers are clamoring for. After years of real-estate pros holding all the informational cards in the home-sale game, Web-driven companies like Zillow, Homes.com and Realtor.com are reshuffling the deck, giving home shoppers and owners estimates of what almost any home is worth. People have flocked to the data in startling numbers: Together, four of the biggest sites that offer home-value estimates get 100 million visits a month, with web surfers using them to determine what to ask or bid for a home, or whether to refinance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for figures that can carry such weight, critics say, the estimates can be far rougher than most people realize. Valuations that are 20% or even 50% higher or lower than a property's eventual sale price are not uncommon, as the sites themselves acknowledge. The estimates frequently change, too—sometimes by hundreds of thousands of dollars—as sites plug new data into their algorithms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of the competitors make it clear their numbers are guesstimates, not gospel. "A Trulia estimate is just that—an estimate," says a disclaimer on that site's new home-value tool. Zillow goes a step further, publishing precise numbers about how imprecise its estimates can be. And every major site urges home-price hunters to consult appraisers or real-estate agents to refine their results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But despite the disclaimers, homeowners and real-estate agents say, many Web surfers put enough faith in the estimates to sway the way they shop and sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Frank and Sue Parks put their manor-style house in Louisville, Ky., on the market, they watched as Zillow put a $331,000 value on the dwelling in May; by July it had climbed to $1.5 million. (Zillow says the lower estimate reflected errors in its statistical model.) The couple got potential buyer referrals from the site, but they fended off a stream of lowball offers before they sold this fall. Mrs. Parks says the estimate roller coaster "really affected our ability to move the place."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Determining a home's value has traditionally been the job of an appraiser, who gathers data on recently sold homes and compares them with the "subject property" to arrive at an estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the late 1980s, economists started developing automated valuation models, or AVMs, computer models that could analyze data about comparable sales, square footage, number of bedrooms and the like, in a matter of seconds. For years, these tools were mostly reserved for in-house analysts at lending banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn't until 2006 that Zillow took them to the masses, with its Zestimates, which now offer values for more than 100 million homes based on the company's own algorithms. "Humans don't make these decisions," says Stan Humphries, chief economist at Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Numbers like these have become weapons in the arsenal of consumers like Simms Jenkins, an Atlanta marketing executive, who has recently relied on online estimates to help him both buy and sell homes. "I can't imagine 25 years ago, when people would just go out and spend their entire Saturday looking at homes," he says. "You don't have to do that now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But appraisers and real-estate consultants say the online models can veer off target with alarming frequency. Most data for the models come from two sources: records from tax assessors and listing data for recent sales. Collection is a challenge, however, because not every county tracks properties the same way—some calculate home size by number of bedrooms, others by overall square footage. And automated models aren't designed to account for the unique construction details that often make or break a deal, or for intangible factors like a neighborhood's gentrification. "You cannot use a computer model in certain areas and expect the value to come out right," says John May, the former assessor of Jefferson County, Ky., which includes the state's largest city, Louisville.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all these reasons, models that banks use often add a "confidence score" to their estimates. Consumer-oriented sites, meanwhile, rely on disclaimers, some of which are eye-opening. Zillow surfers who read the "About Zestimates" page find out that the site's overall error rate—the amount its estimates vary from a homes' actual value—is 8.5%, and that about one-fourth of the estimates are at least 20% off the eventual sale price. In some places, the numbers are far more dramatic: In Hamilton County, Ohio, which includes Cincinnati, it's 82%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sites argue that, over time, edits and corrections will help them perfect their numbers—with many fixes coming from their customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Homes.com, anyone who knows a homeowner's surname and the year the home was last purchased, can edit the details of a property listing in ways that can eventually change the estimated value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow has accepted revisions on 25 million homes—perhaps the strongest testament to how seriously consumers take its estimates. Today, the site says its figures are accurate enough to give consumers a good sense of any home's value. In the meantime, says Mr. Humphries, its economist, "We're always tweaking the algorithm or building a new one."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jessica Silver-Greenberg   </div><div>1907 words</div><div>12 November 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pitch is compelling: Buy a vacant house or apartment building and rent it out to some of the throngs of Americans who have lost their homes to foreclosure. With interest rates near record lows and property values still slumping, getting into the landlord business is cheaper than it has been in years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors turned off by paltry bond yields and the mercurial stock market are intrigued. Kimberly Foss, president of Empyrion Wealth Management in Roseville, Calif., says she has seen a surge of clients looking to purchase distressed homes and apartment buildings. Her clients have an average net worth of about $4 million, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Many of my clients are looking to use part of their portfolios to scoop up properties," she says. "They see it as an alternative retirement plan."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But aspiring property owners need to watch out for a slew of traps. Among them: prolonged vacancies, surprise costs, deadbeat tenants, difficulty refinancing and overestimating the rental potential.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is easy to overlook those risks when the market conditions appear so ripe. Home prices have fallen to 2002 levels nationwide, according to the latest data from the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index, and financing remains cheap. For the week ending Nov. 10, the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate loan was 3.99%, not far from the Oct. 6 record low of 3.94%, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> data going back to 1971.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rents are improving, too. The average monthly rent for all categories, including apartments and single-family homes, was $846 nationwide in the third quarter, up 2.5% from the same period a year earlier, according to Local Market Monitor, a Cary, N.C., firm that analyzes real-estate trends. That is lower than the long-term average gain of 3.5% a year, but better than the 3% decline in calendar year 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the Obama administration is considering getting involved in the rental markets. Government officials have been soliciting ideas for how to convert some of the foreclosed homes owned by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> into rentals, in order to cut the mortgage giants' losses on those homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of this is attracting interest among investors. Brian Davis, who runs ezLandlordForms.com[http://www.ezlandlordforms.com/], a website for property investors, says traffic is up 20% this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Most people think I'm crazy to buy now," says Jason Walker, a marketing director in Washington. But the numbers were too good to pass up, he says. Mr. Walker is closing this week on a town house in Baltimore, for which he paid $275,000. He says he put down 20% of the purchase price, locked in a 4.5% rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage and expects to net $1,000 a month in profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here is what you need to know before taking the plunge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cheaper homes aren't always a good investment. Even if a property is selling for half the price it fetched during the boom, that doesn't mean it will generate enough income to make the deal pay off, says Wayne Copelin, a financial planner in Sugar Land, Texas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key is to figure out how much rental income the property will generate. A good rule of thumb: Make a deal only if you can collect at least 1.25% of the purchase price each year in rental income, says Jason Reed, a real-estate agent in St. Paul, Minn., who works exclusively with investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Determining the rental potential can be tricky. Some properties already have been rented out, and the owner can furnish records. Others have no rental history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One way to examine the rental market is to use websites like FinestExpert.com[http://www.finestexpert.com/], which tracks occupancy rates and rents across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In certain sweet spots, rents are rising even as home prices fall. Take Nashville, Tenn., where rents have jumped 6% over the past 18 months, while home prices have dropped 3%, according to Local Market Monitor. Other markets where that is happening: El Paso, Texas; Houston; Omaha, Neb.; Raleigh, N.C.; Pittsburgh; and Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markets in areas that have been battered by foreclosures, such as Las Vegas and Phoenix, remain unstable. They might have low prices, but they also are suffering from high unemployment. That could leave aspiring landlords with empty homes, which then could fall even further in value, according to Local Market Monitor President Ingo Winzer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local Market Monitor cites Austin, Texas; Akron, Ohio; and Dallas as among the most attractive markets overall, and calls Detroit, Las Vegas and West Palm Beach, Fla., "dangerous."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When looking at properties, act like a renter, says Jeff Cronrod, president of the Boulder, Colo.-based American Apartment Owners Association. Tour the neighborhood to see if landlords seem desperate to lure tenants. Are there lots of vacancies? Are buildings offering deals like living rent free for a couple of months in order to drive up demand? If so, be wary, Mr. Cronrod says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carrying costs add up. Another pitfall for real-estate investors: not accounting for unexpected expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides closing costs, which generally average between 3% and 6% of the purchase price, general maintenance expenses like taxes, insurance and repairs can be much higher than many investors expect, says Jason Post, president of Los Angeles based Post Investment Group, a boutique real-estate investment firm that buys and operates apartment buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You should allot roughly $2,000 a year for insurance, taxes and any association fees for neighborhood pools and the like, Mr. Reed says. To ensure that a major repair doesn't break you, set aside at least six months' worth of expected rent, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You can't even fathom some of these strange costs," says Jerry Garretty, who runs a property-management firm in San Jose, Calif. Six months ago, Mr. Garretty says, he found a nasty surprise after overseeing the eviction of tenants who were three months behind on rent in a Cupertino, Calif., home: They had poured quick-drying cement into the sewer pipes—a $1,000 repair—and defaced the walls with graffiti scrawls, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jumps in property insurance premiums also can dent your investment profits, says Jason Holtz, a real-estate lawyer with Kevin Jursinski &amp; Associates in Fort Myers, Fla. This is particularly common in states like Florida that are prone to tropical storms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kathleen Farmakidis, owner of a three-unit apartment building in Winter Haven, Fla., says she has seen her property insurance jump 50% this year, to $110 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Venturing far from home can be dicey. It is a good idea to buy rental properties only in your immediate geographical area, Mr. Cronrod says. Although it might be tempting to venture far from where you live for better deals, those properties can be difficult to manage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As an owner, you need to be ready to repair leaky faucets, collapsed roofs and all other middle-of-the-night disasters—or pay someone to do it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hiring a local property manager can help. Such managers perform maintenance, collect rent and even screen tenants. But they typically charge 8% to 10% of the annual rent for their services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And some are much better than others. Michael Epstein bought a single-family home in Pompano Beach, Fla., in 2009 even though he lived more than an hour's drive away in Jupiter and the house needed work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Epstein, a small-business owner, hired a property manager to rehab the house, which he scooped up at a foreclosure sale, and maintain it. But because Mr. Epstein didn't visit often, it took him months to discover the manager hadn't been overseeing construction and that the work was botched. He had to spend an additional $40,000 to bring the property up to building codes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That was a risk I didn't even factor in," Mr. Epstein says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It pays to plan conservatively. Don't assume you will be able to attract renters immediately. If a neighborhood is littered with foreclosures, those properties aren't going to be any more attractive to would-be renters than they are to buyers, says Jim Evans, president of real-estate investment firm Bruce G. Pollack &amp; Associates and president of the nonprofit Institute of Real Estate Management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best tactic, say financial advisers, is to build in a cushion. Assume you need at least three months to find a tenant, and keep that much cash in reserve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Interdonato wishes he had foreseen the dry spell he would suffer after buying an investment property in Cape Coral, Fla., for $280,000 in 2005. The electrical engineer planned to rent it out for enough to cover the $2,200 mortgage payments. But after the property sat empty for more than a year, starting in 2009, Mr. Interdonato fell behind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last December, after having sunk 50% of his savings into the property, he was forced to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It felt like I was staring down the barrel of a shotgun," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Refinancing can be difficult. With interest rates so low, many homeowners have been able to refinance their mortgages recently. But lenders are reluctant to take on refinances of investment properties, says Matt Englett, a real-estate lawyer in Orlando, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks view such owners as more of a risk, he says, because they can walk away from the property more easily than owners of primary residences can.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Cheplowitz, the owner of an international event-planning firm in Aurora, Ohio, says he is losing roughly $24,000 a year on two properties in Collier County, Fla. Last week, a lender declined his applications to refinance the mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cheplowitz says he despairs whenever he flies down to check on the properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Here I am, staying in a crappy motel," he says, "as tenants live in these beautiful carriage houses I am losing money on."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Screen tenants with care. Renting out your property to unreliable people can be a costly mistake. Eviction proceedings can take months, and owners can't rent out the property until the eviction is final.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Ourand, a chief marketing officer for a technology company, says he battled for nearly 10 months to evict a tenant who had stopped paying rent in February on a four-bedroom town house in Arnold, Md.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ourand, who lives in nearby Severna Park, says he trekked to court three times to get the tenant to pay up. In October, he says, he was able to oust the delinquent tenant, whom he says trashed the place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ourand says the ordeal cost him roughly a third of his annual investment income on the property. "This is the worst experience with investment properties I have ever been through," he says. "It was a nightmare."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even tenants with clean credit can turn out to be unsavory. Attorney Rachell Horbenko says she had to boot tenants from her Chicago building after waking up in the middle of the night to the smell of marijuana. The tenants were consuming so much, she says, that the smoke had seeped into her six-month-old daughter's room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The room was cloudy," she says. "I could barely see the crib." The eviction process took more than three months, she says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the second time in history—and the second time in as many months—average rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell below 4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After falling to an average 3.94% on a 30-year fixed mortgage in the week ending Oct. 6, rates had ticked back up over the past month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, amid mixed signals about the health of the U.S. economy, rates on the 30-year mortgage fell to average 3.99% for the week ending Nov. 10, down from 4% last week and 4.17% a year ago, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>'s latest survey of conforming mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The economy added 80,000 net jobs in October, below the market consensus forecast, but employment gains over the prior two months were revised up by 102,000 and the unemployment rate fell to 9.0%, the lowest in six months," said Freddie Mac Chief Economist Frank Nothaft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nothaft added that while one recent report showed improvement in factory orders, a separate reading also showed expansion slowed in the service industry last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low home prices and mortgage rates have kept affordability high, Mr. Nothaft said, adding that the National Association of Realtors' housing affordability index in September hit its third highest reading on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages also dropped slightly, averaging 3.3% this week, down from 3.31% last week and 3.57% a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five-year Treasury-indexed hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages averaged 2.98% this week, up slightly from 2.96% last week. The ARM averaged 3.25% a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And 1-year Treasury-indexed ARMs averaged 2.95% this week, up from 2.88% last week. The ARM averaged 3.26% a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To obtain the rates, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage required payment of an average 0.7 of a point, the 15-year fixed-rate mortgage required an average 0.8 point and the ARMs required an average 0.6 point. A point is 1% of the mortgage amount, charged as prepaid interest.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices fell in nearly three-quarters of metropolitan areas in the third quarter and the national median price dropped 4.7% as the housing market continued to show weakness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for previously occupied homes sold in the July-to-September quarter declined when compared with last year in 111 out of 150 metro areas tracked by the National Association of Realtors, the trade group said Wednesday. Prices rose in 39 metro areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results were roughly even with the second quarter, in which median prices fell in 109 out of 151 cities tracked by the real estate trade association. The national median price for single-family homes sold in the third quarter fell to $169,500 from the same quarter a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the economy weak and many Americans reluctant to commit to a home purchase, the housing market has been slow to recover from the worst downtown in decades. The Realtors' group said last month that the number of people who signed contracts to purchase previously occupied homes in the U.S. sank in September to the lowest level in five months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors' latest report showed sales of homes in the third quarter were up 17% from a year earlier, a period in which sales dropped off due to the expiration of a federal tax credit. They were down 0.1% from the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home sales need to recover first, only then can prices stabilize," said Lawrence Yun, the Realtors' chief economist, in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The metro areas showing the biggest decline in median prices from a year earlier were Mobile, Ala. (-17.7%), Phoenix (-17.6%), Allentown, Pa. (-17.5%) and Salt Lake City (-15.3%). Areas where prices rose included Grand Rapids, Mich. (23.7%), South Bend, Ind. (19.8%), Palm Bay-Melbourne, Fla. (17.7%) and Youngstown, Ohio (13.1%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Dales, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics, forecasts that U.S. home prices will fall a further 3% by the end of this year, due to weak demand, a poor economy and a high supply of foreclosures and other distressed properties on the market. It will take "years rather than months for a proper recovery to get going," said Mr. Dales, who predicts home prices nationally won't mount a sustained rise until 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, "distressed property," including foreclosures and homes at risk of foreclosure, accounted for 30% of third-quarter transactions, down from 33% in the second quarter, the Realtors' group estimated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices rose 13.1% in Youngstown, Ohio, in the third quarter. An earlier version of this article incorrectly indicated that the increase took place in Youngstown, Pa.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Bobby White   </div><div>1005 words</div><div>10 November 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OAKLEY—Faced with hundreds of half-built houses and empty building lots due to the housing downturn, city officials here persuaded a regional agency to lower home-construction permit fees to jump-start building activity across Contra Costa County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the move sparked an outcry from some cities that depend on permit fees for infrastructure projects. Others question whether lowering the fees during a down economy will bring back residential construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All of us—Antioch and other cities in the county—depend on that [fee] money because it supports our major roadways," said Brian Kalinowski, a city council member in Antioch and chairman of the Transplan Committee, a county transportation planning body. "I don't support cutting those fees just for housing. Not at this time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kalinowski said fees from building permits have been used to construct the State Route 4 bypass and the widening of Route 4 from four lanes to eight in Antioch—projects costing more than $200 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't think this will be the catalyst for spurring construction," said Paul Eldredge, city manager of Brentwood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Bryan Montgomery, city manager of Oakley, said the town 50 miles northeast of San Francisco needed to do something to stoke construction. "No action is too small if it brings jobs back or helps calm the economics of this region," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The intracounty verbal sparring underlines the tensions that municipalities and regional agencies face as they balance cutting fees to try to fuel economic activity and the effects that the loss in revenue might cause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across San Francisco Bay, the city of Sunnyvale is raising fees charged housing developers by 66%—or as much as $20,000—to help fund city services, but developers argue the move is driving up housing costs and sued in September to stop the city from proceeding. The case is pending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mary Piepho, a member of Contra Costa County's Board of Supervisors and of the East Contra Costa Regional Fee and Financing Authority, the body to which Oakley applied to lower permit charges, said the agency faces tough decisions in balancing the needs of some communities with the economic climate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are a lot of communities in Contra Costa that are hurting and we want to give as much aid as possible," she said. "But we must be careful not to damage or add to the problems of other cities and neighborhoods."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, home builders in Contra Costa County pay permit fees of about $18,000 for each single-family home they build and about $11,000 for a multifamily unit, according to county records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The East Contra Costa Regional Fee and Financing Authority uses the permit-fee revenue to pay for projects such as new roads or to extend existing highways. The authority is studying how much the building-permit fees should be cut and a final decision won't be made until next month, said Ms. Piepho.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advocates for the fee cuts say the permit charges were set at the height of the real-estate bubble last decade and don't reflect today's economic reality. Paul Campos, general counsel of the Building Industry Association of the Bay Area, which represents developers, said housing prices have dropped in many cities by 50% to 60%. That has prompted cities and counties in many parts of California to lower fees, "but the Bay Area is lagging behind," said Mr. Campos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oakley, a suburban city dotted with strip malls and shopping centers, benefited from a population boom last decade as workers in San Francisco and parts of Silicon Valley moved there to take advantage of larger, cheaper houses. The city has about 10,000 more residents than it did in 2000, when census figures estimated a population of 25,000 people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid the population boom, Oakley mapped out new neighborhoods. In 2002, officials approved new developments, authorizing new sewer lines, sidewalks, gas and water hookups and other infrastructure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2007, housing began to slow down. According to county records, Contra Costa County issued 983 single-family home permits in 2008, down by more than half from the 2,000 issued in 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2009, developers and regional advocacy groups began pushing to drive down construction fees. That year, they persuaded Contra Costa County's Board of Supervisors to eliminate impact fees, which cities charge to pay for new infrastructure such as roads, until this December. The cut is estimated to have saved some developers about $4,000 per home, or a 5% savings on building costs in some instances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Montgomery, the Oakley city manager, said developers also approached him and officials at other cities in 2009 to lower fees. By summer of last year, he noticed a sharp drop in construction starts and decided to act, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In particular, Mr. Montgomery said he was moved by the lack of new development in a location called the East Cypress Specific Plan area, formerly called Hotchkiss Tract, which encompasses about 2,500 acres in northeast Oakley with more than 500 building lots available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have neighborhoods that have been left in limbo as a result of the downturn," said Mr. Montgomery. "They've got the necessary infrastructure but no housing. We had to do something to get those houses finished."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In summer 2010, Mr. Montgomery began lobbying the East Contra Costa fee authority by conducting meetings along with groups that included builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the end of last year, Ms. Piepho of the fee authority said the county won federal grants for highway improvements totaling more than $80 million. Those funds allowed the authority to re-examine some of its fees, she said, and in September, the agency decided to lower the building-permit charges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The extra money gave us room to make the extra cuts," she said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pain in Indian Property</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's time for India's property developers to get real. A slew of negative indicators has been stacking up against the sector for at least a year, yet developers are still clinging to hopes of high property prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cost of new residential properties in some areas continues to rise even as the market sours. In New Delhi and Mumbai, for example, prices were up 13% from a year earlier in September, while sales were down by 30% and 24%, respectively, data from real-estate research firm Liases Foras show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The malaise is partly the result of efforts to prevent a housing-sector collapse. In late 2008, as the property market tottered, the <span class="companylink">Reserve Bank of India</span> leaned on banks to restructure loans to developers so as to delay repayment, while the government pressured lenders to offer low mortgage rates. Those effects are wearing off -- since May, interest rates have been rising along with inflation, putting borrowers under pressure. Another RBI bailout seems unlikely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, developers' rising debt has covered up for falling sales, but the borrowing is also leaving them increasingly vulnerable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though developers may be in a state of denial, investors in their shares are not: The <span class="companylink">Bombay Stock Exchange</span>'s Realty index is down nearly 50% in the past year, compared with a 14% drop in the Sensex. Foreign investors who had proved keen on the long-term India property story in the past are also pulling back. The portion of India's foreign direct investment that is going into real estate has fallen to just over 2% so far this fiscal year, down from an aggregate 7% since 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually, the strain of declining sales volumes will become too much for developers' balance sheets. Unless home prices are allowed to drop, inventory will get very stale. The problems are clear to investors; India's property developers need to wise up too.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Europe's Struggle</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To Keep Growing</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Europe is at risk of a potentially devastating negative feedback loop. The economy is "practically in free fall," says Yves Mersch, a member of the European Central Bank's governing council. ECB President Mario Draghi has warned publicly of a recession. The latest economic data bear out their gloomy assessments. Failure to tackle the sovereign-debt crisis has fueled the downturn, but a new recession makes the crisis even harder to solve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While investor attention has been focused on Athens and Cannes, the economic headlines have been disastrous. The euro-zone economy could shrink 0.4% in the fourth quarter, judging by the latest Markit euro-zone composite purchasing managers' index, reckons <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span>. This closely watched index fell to 46.5 in October from 49.1 in September. Anything below 50 indicates an economic contraction. France, Spain and Italy are all contracting; Germany is just holding its head above water. But that may not last. New factory orders in Germany fell 4.3% on the month in September, with orders from the euro zone plummeting 12%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This will make fiscal consolidation much trickier. If the euro-zone economy tips into recession, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Belgium are likely to miss deficit targets by an average of two percentage points of gross domestic product over 2012-2014, <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span> estimates. That could mean the ratio of debt to GDP is around 15 percentage points higher than expected by 2014. Greece's numbers would look even worse. And if these countries respond to recession with yet more austerity, the downturn is likely to be even deeper, pushing debt-to-GDP higher. That, in turn, increases the likelihood they require further help from Europe's bailout facilities, transmitting strain to stronger states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, austerity is starting to bite in northern Europe and will intensify next year. The composite PMI reading for France fell to a 30-month low of 45.6 in October, suggesting a 0.2% contraction is in the cards in the fourth quarter, <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> says. A renewed recession in France could threaten its triple-A rating, <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> recently warned. That poses a risk to the triple-A rating of the European Financial Stability Facility, the euro-zone bailout fund. A worsening sovereign-debt crisis will further batter the continent's banks, cutting credit provision. European banks tightened lending conditions in the third quarter and expect to tighten further, an ECB survey shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Europe faces three growth shocks: fiscal consolidation, weaker global demand and the debt crisis. Resolving the debt crisis remains crucial to reviving growth. That leaves little option but to push ahead with fiscal tightening and structural reform, making economies more competitive so that they can grow faster. But those policies will take time to yield results -- and time is no longer on the euro zone's side.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kirin Isn't Watered Down</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Brazil Beer Transaction</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ah, the thirst-quenching properties of an ice-cold cerveja, swallowed whole. Japanese beer and beverage maker <span class="companylink">Kirin Holdings</span> has gotten its hands on the 49.54% of shares in Brazil's Schincariol it didn't already own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal brings closure to a three-month battle with the company's minority shareholders, who refused to sell after Kirin bought half of Brazil's No. 2 beer company by sales volume earlier in the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But perhaps more satisfying for Kirin's shareholders was a statement from managing director Hirotake Kobayashi that the company won't pay for the deal by issuing more stock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal, paid with around $1.3 billion in cash and loans, increases Kirin's debt-to-equity ratio to 1.10, above its midterm plan to keep it at 1.0 or below. Some analysts had expressed concern that Kirin might issue equity to keep its debt down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given that Kirin has averaged almost two acquisitions a year over the past decade, it is positive news for shareholders that Kirin has no intention of using equity financing for further deals right now. In fact, Mr. Kobayashi said that deals financed with debt are unlikely too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are other issues for Kirin, whose stock has fallen 16% since it took a position in Schincariol in August. The company on Friday halved its profit forecast for the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there is the question of the price it has paid for entry to Brazil's growing beer market. The total cost for 100% of Schincariol prices the enterprise value of the company at a multiple of 13 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the year through March 2011, according to Citigroup Research. That looks a little rich compared to a multiple of 11 paid by Heineken last year for FEMSA Cervesa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Management also has yet to prove it can integrate the businesses it has been buying. Kirin has spent nearly $8 billion to expand food and beverage company Lion in Australia without yet generating the margins it has targeted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Integrating Schincariol will be no easy task. Selling more beer than the previous owners did at better margins in a competitive Brazilian market could prove a sterner test. For now, though, shareholders should be cheered by a deal that doesn't leave them watered down.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> tapped the U.S. government for another $6 billion in aid after the mortgage-finance giant's loss widened to $4.4 billion in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cash drain is the latest sign of how the shaky U.S. housing market continues to bleed red ink for the firm that the government rescued more than three years ago and increased the tab to taxpayers for Freddie alone to $56 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company needs the new funds to cover the loss, as well as the $1.6 billion that it borrowed in order to pay required quarterly dividends back to the government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loss, Freddie's worst quarterly showing in more than one year, compares to a loss of $2.5 billion a year ago. In a statement, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> Chief Executive Charles E. Haldeman Jr. attributed the poor performance to "the weak housing market as well as challenging financial market conditions."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Freddie and its cousin, <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, were taken over by the government at the height of the credit crisis in 2008. Fannie and Freddie have been pledged unlimited support from the U.S. Treasury through the end of next year, and the government has agreed to inject up to around $300 billion after that to keep the firms afloat and stabilize mortgage markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the most recent draw on Treasury funds, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> has now borrowed $71 billion from the government, and it has paid nearly $15 billion back in the form of the 10% annual dividend payments that are required on its government aid. <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, which has yet to report its third-quarter results, has taken nearly $104 billion in aid and paid back around $15 billion. The net cost to the taxpayers for bailing out both firms stands at $145 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Freddie's quarterly loss stemmed in part from mark-to-market losses on derivative investments that are used to reduce <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>'s exposure to interest-rate risk. The company recorded a $4.8 billion loss on those investments as interest rates dropped during the July-to-September period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Standard accounting rules force Freddie to write down the values of the derivative investments, but they aren't able to account for the values of the assets or liabilities that are being hedged. As a result, the investments may not actually lose value over time, but they often result in earnings volatility, showing bigger mark-to-market losses when rates fall and corresponding gains when rates rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Potentially more troubling was the $3.6 billion loss that resulted from Freddie's decision to boost its loan-loss reserves for the second straight quarter. That reversed several quarters of declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Are the losses going to accelerate, the deeper they go into their pile of problem loans?" said Jim Vogel, an analyst at FTN Financial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Losses at <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> had eased over the last year, with the company returning more money to the government than it borrowed in each of the previous four quarters. The firm's losses continue to stem from loans made as the housing boom turned to bust, and loans being made today are expected to be profitable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The red ink underscores the continued costs from a housing market that is struggling to find a bottom. While mortgage delinquencies have stopped growing, Freddie and Fannie are now selling tens of thousands of properties that they are taking back through foreclosure. As home prices fall, they will take bigger losses on those sales. Freddie sold around 25,000 homes during the third quarter and acquired another 24,000 through foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company said losses may also be rising because Freddie hasn't been able to recover as much money from mortgage insurance firms that are under financial stress of their own. Last month, for example, state insurance regulators took over <span class="companylink">PMI Group Inc</span>., one of the nation's largest mortgage insurance companies. Insurance companies reimburse Freddie for a share of losses when loans default.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese Property Collapse 101</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What does a meltdown in China's economy look like?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It starts in the property sector, the main driver of domestic growth. Government controls on speculators have already started to bring residential-property prices down. National average prices for residential property fell 0.23% in October from September, the second month in a row of falling prices, according to data released Tuesday by the China Real Estate Index System.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If buyers who are used to prices moving only upward adopt a wait-and-see attitude, then sales volumes will fall. Sales so far this year have been robust, up 12% from a year earlier in the first nine months. But it hasn't always been that way. In 2008, sales fell 15%. A repeat would leave developers short of cash to cover their costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most stressed developers would be forced into a fire sale of inventory, sharply lowering prices to attract buyers. In what could be a sign of things to come, prices at two new developments in Shanghai were cut by more than 20% in October. In a competitive market, once one developer starts to lower prices, everyone will be forced to follow. The result would be a write-down of asset values and lower profit expectations across the sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers in crisis mode would slow investment. Real-estate investment growth so far in 2011 is tearing along at 35% year to year. But that level of expenditure isn't guaranteed. In the first two months of 2009, year-to-year growth dipped to 4.7%. If sales dry up and credit remains in short supply, a similar decline in 2012 isn't outside the realm of possibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A fall of that magnitude in real-estate investment could knock more than two percentage points off China's gross-domestic-product growth, expected to come in around 9% in 2011. The spillover from the slowdown in demand for construction materials, unemployment and the hit to household wealth means the impact could be much greater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The financial system wouldn't escape the consequences. Around 20% of banks' loan book is directly tied to the real-estate sector. Another 16% has been lent to local governments, which receive 40% of their revenue from land sales. Falling prices for property would knock land prices lower and increase defaults from both sources. With growth slowing and asset quality crumbling, the Chinese government would have a full-fledged crisis on its hands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is the worst-case scenario. The central case is that China will muddle through with strong fundamental demand underpinning property prices, and deep government pockets backstopping the banks. But Beijing isn't omniscient. China's property prices are edging down, and the response is difficult to predict. The possibility of a sharp fall in prices spiraling out of the government's control is small -- but it exists. If that happens, it is time to revisit the chances of a hard landing.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beware When</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">India Sells</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">India's government is desperate to raise funds by selling bits of state-owned companies. But while New Delhi is a keen seller, potential investors should keep up their guard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To bolster its finances, India has targeted a handful of divestments it hopes will generate $8 billion this fiscal year. With only five months to go before the March year end, however, New Delhi has raised just 2.9% of its goal. In the meantime, sources of income needed for social-welfare plans and infrastructure projects are drying up. New Delhi's stake sales will take on more urgency, but investors need to scrutinize what is on offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take ONGC, India's largest oil and gas exploration company. The government owns about 74% and planned to unload 5% to the public in September, before turmoil in the markets put the sale on ice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But anyone buying will have trouble trying to parse the policy risks. ONGC has to pay oil-marketing companies subsidies that are determined by New Delhi; in the April-June quarter, ONGC's discounts to retailers were more than double its net profit, and these subsidies can rise or fall at the government's policy whim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the next four years, India has plans to sell stakes in about 60 state-owned companies. Five, including ONGC, have already been approved for the government's divestment plans. For investors, most carry a degree of policy risk.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greek Move</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deepens</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Euro Zone's</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Debt Crisis</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George Papandreou's decision to call a referendum on Greece's latest debt deal is an astonishing roll of the dice. The Greek prime minister is asking the country to decide whether it wishes to continue with a debt deal that will require Greece to effectively hand over its economic sovereignty to Brussels and endure at least another nine years of brutal austerity at the end of which its debt-to-GDP ratio will still be 120%, higher than Italy today. The alternative is to vote down the debt deal, a path that would likely lead to default, exit from the euro and European Union and economic collapse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result has been to throw the euro zone back into turmoil: A referendum is unlikely before January, and current opinion polls suggest 60% of Greeks oppose the deal. Much depends on what question is actually asked and how opposition parties respond. But the decision seems to have caught Brussels by surprise and will no doubt have enraged other euro-zone leaders, coming just days after they cobbled together the latest summit deal, billed as a comprehensive response to the euro crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in reality, the debt deal was patently inadequate, not only leaving Greece's debt burden at a level that few believe is sustainable but also capping the possibility of future debt relief from the private sector as a result of the 30 billion euro ($41.6 billion) collateral deal agreed on with the banks. Meanwhile, Greece's official lenders, including the European Central Bank, refuse to take losses on their own exposures. Germany and the other northern European countries continue to resist any fiscal transfer -- and it is even argued that to provide one would be illegal under the EU's "no bailout" rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps Mr. Papandreou can convince Greek voters that their destiny remains within the euro. But his decision is a reminder that the future of the euro won't just be determined by leaders at grand summits. Greece has always had the option to repudiate its debts if it considers that in its national self-interest. That in turn will fuel the fear that the euro zone is losing control of this crisis. Certainly, it is hard to see why other countries, such as China, should put their own taxpayers' money at risk to save the euro when there is so much uncertainty over the euro zone's ability to save itself. The warm glow from last week's summit lasted about 48 hours. Mr. Papandreou has ensured the gloom will last for months.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. manufacturing sector barely expanded in October, according to data released Tuesday by the Institute for Supply Management, in a report that follows other disappointing factory figures around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, spending on construction in the U.S. inched ahead during September, though overall the sector continues to struggle with weak demand for new projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM's manufacturing purchasing managers' index fell to 50.8 last month from 51.6 in September. A reading above 50 indicates expanding activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had expected the October PMI to increase to 52.0.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchasing-managers reports around the globe largely show a weak global manufacturing sector as businesses grapple with slowing demand. In particular, the October PMI reported by China's government fell sharply to its lowest level since February 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. ISM said, "Comments from respondents are mixed, indicating positive relief from raw materials pricing and continuing strength in a few industries, but there is also more concern and caution about growth in this uncertain economy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within the U.S. report, the subindexes were generally mixed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM's new-orders index increased to 52.4 from 49.6, while the production index slowed to 50.1 from 51.2.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The factory-employment index was little changed at 53.5 from 53.8 in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory index weakened sharply to 46.7, from 52.0 in September. The exports index fell to 50.0 from 53.5.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price pressures eased sharply. The prices index plunged to 41.0 from 56.0. The October reading was the first to be below 50 mark since May 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, construction spending in September grew by 0.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $787.21 billion, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction spending rose 1.6% in August from July, according to revised figures released Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The small September increase shows that construction spending remains held in check by an uncertain economy. New-home sales are near record lows, and municipal governments have been reluctant to spend as they grapple with budget shortfalls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Year over year, overall construction spending was 1.3% lower than in September 2010. Spending on U.S. residential projects rose 0.7% in September to $236.32 billion compared with the prior month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New housing starts in September reached the highest level in 17 months, a separate report released last month said. The jump, however, was mainly due to a surge in apartment and condominium construction rather than single-family homes, which grew only slightly. Single-family home construction is the primary driver of residential construction spending.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale of a huge block of vacant apartments in a foreclosed Miami development has marked an important milestone in the city's housing recovery: The condo glut is coming to an end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ever since the recession hit, Miami has been awash in thousands of distressed condos left over from the boom years. Slowly, the glut has been absorbed as investors purchased blocks of these units at huge discounts and then rented them out or resold them one by one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now a group led by real-estate investor Ronald Krongold has closed on what many believe is the last of these distressed bulk deals. The group purchased 539 units in three buildings that were part of a sprawling $2.3 billion mixed-use project called Midtown Miami, near the city's Design District .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seller was <span class="companylink">HSBC Bank USA</span>, which had taken the units back in a friendly foreclosure in July from a group including New York developer Joseph Cayre, who originally built the condo buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price Mr. Krongold's group paid reflects the improving health of the condo market. At about $110 million, it came to $183 a square foot and 75 cents for each dollar of debt. Price tags on earlier bulk deals were as low as 30 cents to 50 cents on the dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Krongold declined to specify the price. But he acknowledged the deals aren't as sweet as they used to be. "We did not get a bargain basement price," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Krongold, who secured financing for the deal from Ladder Capital, a New York commercial real-estate finance firm, plans to rent the units for several years and then sell them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rebound in the Miami condo market—while housing remains anemic in most other parts of the country—reflects the strong foreign demand for units in Florida's most cosmopolitan city. Average condo prices, which fell to as low as $200 a square foot during the depths of the recession, have risen to about $325 a square foot, according to Scott Wadler, a real estate analyst with HFF L.P.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Midtown acquisition represents one of the last remaining 100-plus unit bulk condominium opportunities in all of South Florida," Mr. Wadler says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average condominium prices are still well below the peak levels they hit during the go-go years: about $400 to $500 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those prices fueled a development boom that added some 22,000 new apartment units to the city, says HFF. The economic downtown caused thousands of buyers to back out of purchase contracts and left developers saddled with massive debts and entire buildings sitting empty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first, banks and other lenders that foreclosed on these developments sold units in bulk. But the overhang steadily shrank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 22,000 new units added, fewer than 3,500 remain unsold, according to Mr. Wadler. "People are re-launching projects and are selling them retail not wholesale," says Arnaud Karsenti, a principal at 13th Floor Investments who buys real-estate debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Miami's upscale Brickell district, the Icon, a three-tower condo project developed by Jorge Perez's Related Group, announced in October that it had fewer than 20 units of its 1,800 condos left, and expected to sell out in November. Buyers have come from 40 different countries, including Argentina, Colombia, Qatar and Gabon, and prices are between $400 and $500 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, a slowdown in the global economy could put a crimp on demand and slow the Miami condo market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pickup in demand has come too late to help some owners, though. For example, Mr. Perez actually had to hand over keys to two of the three Icon towers to his lender in 2010, after running into trouble on $500 million in debt. Related Group stayed on as manager of the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for now, strong demand is bringing back to market once-distressed projects. In early October, an investment partnership including ST Residential, a unit of a team led by <span class="companylink">Starwood Capital Group</span>, and commercial lender iStar Residential re-launched sales at Paramount Bay, a 47-story waterfront tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starwood and its partners bought the building as part of an FDIC portfolio sale of the assets of failed Corus Bank, which sold for 60 cents on the dollar in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, Paramount Bay's 340 units, which feature interiors designed by rock musician Lenny Kravitz, are selling for $400 a square foot. Miami's priciest buildings were trading for over $600 a square foot at the height of the boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Retail prices are almost back to the good old days," said Edgardo Defortuna, president of <span class="companylink">Fortune International</span>, a Miami-based brokerage.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four months ago, Ky Nguyen was paying about $6,000 a month in rent for his small, 1,600 square-foot dental office, part of a mostly vacant strip mall in Manteca, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, he bought the entire 25,000 square-foot mall for $1.9 million, one-fifth of what the prior owner paid, purchasing it from a loan servicer that had foreclosed on the property. Now, with an affordable mortgage and some rental revenue, his debt service comes to about $2,000 a month less than he used to pay in rent for his office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We jumped on the opportunity," said Mr. Nguyen, a 36-year-old Vietnamese immigrant. He plans to fill much of the vacant space with a restaurant run by his in-laws and a chiropractor's office run by his wife.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three years after the economy's turn sent commercial property prices tumbling, opportunities for investors are on the rise as lenders and servicers are disposing of a growing volume of distressed loans and foreclosed properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increased flow brings in new owners to "zombie" buildings that have for years been struggling with high vacancy and a lack of investment by owners overwhelmed by debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, though, the new owners pose a threat to existing landlords who are still struggling to get by on boom-year debt levels. Today's investors are able to charge lower rents and still make a profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing landlords are "between a rock and a hard place," says William Robert, a Scottsdale, Ariz.-based former banker who now invests in distressed property with his sons. "They can't make their debt service on the lower rental rates that are available."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Special servicers, the troubled loan specialists that oversee hundreds of billions in commercial mortgages on behalf of bond investors, have sold $11.6 billion in distressed loans and foreclosed property in the past 12 months, according to analysts at <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank AG</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's up from $7 billion over the prior 12-month period and from $1.2 billion in the 12 months prior to that, according to <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By and large, these assets are being shed at big losses. Of the loans sold by the special servicers, bond investors suffered an average 38% loss on loans or property sold this year, according to <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For the first year or two of the crisis, stuff was coming in faster than it would go out," said Tad Philipp, a managing director at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Investor Service who tracks commercial mortgages. Now, he said, "a whole lot of stuff that got into trouble in '09 has now gone through the process."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While bank asset sales statistics aren't available, some banks also have picked up the pace of sales activity, say buyers of distressed properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're finally starting to dump these assets at prices that make sense," said Nate Paul, chief executive of World Class Capital Group, an Austin, Texas-based private-equity firm that has spent about $150 million on 25 acquisitions this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Distressed property sales have been occurring throughout the economic recovery. But the commercial mortgage sales throughout 2009 and 2010 were generally dominated by a few banks and the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp</span>., which unloaded assets to major private-equity firms in large pools, sometimes filled with hundreds of properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the workload for lenders and servicers is growing, as troubled loans made during the boom years increasingly come due.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Around $400 billion of commercial real-estate loans made by all lenders mature in 2012, up from $375 billion this year and $250 billion in 2010, according to <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, many property owners who are unable to pay off mortgages amid a sluggish economic recovery are cutting deals with lenders and servicers to modify and extend the terms of these loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But each month, billions of dollars of new properties fall into default.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The delinquency rate for loans tied to commercial mortgage-backed securities shot up through 2009 and 2010 and has hovered between 9% and 10% for much of the past year. The rate reached 9.8% in October, its second-highest mark ever, according to real estate research service Trepp LLC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What you're going to see over the next three years is a potential ever-increasing volume of loans going into default," said Robert Lieber, executive managing director of C-III Capital Partners LLC, which controls a special servicer that currently oversees more than $17 billion in troubled commercial loans and foreclosed properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers are welcoming the increased volume of distressed assets being put on the block.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of them raised money in the early years of the downturn in hopes of buying discounted properties but until recently there hasn't been much for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opportunities are increasing in particular for small investors like Mr. Nguyen. Most of the loans and properties being sold by special servicers are small, with an average size in 2011 of $8.4 million, according to <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Auction.com, a commercial loan-sale website that has sold more than $5 billion in commercial loans and foreclosed properties this year, says 80% to 90% of its buyers are smaller local investors.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jim Carlton   </div><div>840 words</div><div>1 November 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">INCLINE VILLAGE, Nev.—One of the country's most successful property tax revolts is about to get another day in court, as lawyers for residents in this wealthy Lake Tahoe community who won a record $43 million in refunds are seeking even more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The residents argue that Washoe County's assessments should be "equalized" with those of a nearby county, which has comparable homes abutting the lake but assessments up to 50% lower. Lawyers for the residents will press the Nevada Supreme Court on Tuesday to reinstate a case that argues such equalization should take place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the Incline Village homeowners entitled to refunds under the $43 million ruling in July are <span class="companylink">Oracle Corp</span>. billionaire Larry Ellison, former junk-bond king Michael Milken and Peoplesoft founder Dave Duffield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. homeowners increasingly are challenging tax assessments. In some cases, they are contesting run-ups in property assessments when the housing market was flush. In other cases, homeowners argue their assessments haven't fallen as much as their home values have since 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Toms River, N.J., about 1,000 homeowners won refunds totaling over $1 million after filing appeals of their township assessments from 2009 to 2011, when they saw their house values fall faster than their assessments, said Philip Giannuario, an attorney representing them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Nevada lawsuit could encourage other regions to fight property taxes, said Sheila Anderson, a broker at Commercial Property Services Inc. in Ocala, Fla., who helped organize residential property-tax protests in her state. "I think it's very significant and we're all watching it," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Sandpoint, Idaho, members of an antitax group say the Nevada fight inspired them to take actions including voting in county commissioners more amenable to reining in property tax increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Tahoe case also led to passage of a 2005 Nevada law that took away the power of counties to use their own methodologies to set tax assessments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tax experts say how the Nevada case plays out could have more repercussions nationally. "Any time residential taxpayers can see somebody be hugely successful in a tax appeal, of course it inspires them," said John Garippa, president of American Property Tax Counsel, a Chicago-based trade group for property-tax attorneys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the Nevada Supreme Court rules in the Tahoe residents' favor, and the lower court that turned away the case follows suit, residents could receive millions more in refunds on top of those the court awarded in July, their lawyers said. The court ruled then that Washoe County improperly raised property taxes on 8,700 homeowners in Incline Village and adjoining Crystal Bay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $43 million refund award is believed to be the highest ever in the U.S., Mr. Garippa said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Nevada dispute began after homeowners saw property taxes jump in 2003. Kern Schumacher said the tax bill for his 12,900-square-foot house in Incline Village rose 40% to $200,539 after a rise of less than 1% in 2002. Although he said he could afford the increase, the railroad executive banded with neighbors against it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The attitude [of county officials] is we have more money than everyone else and we can afford it," said the 71-year-old Mr. Schumacher, whose house is valued by the county at $11.2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Washoe County officials blame a 1981 change in state tax law that let county assessors use their own techniques to value homes rather than relying strictly on market values. "It kind of put all county assessors in the state in a bit of a no-man's land," said David Creekman, Washoe County's chief deputy district attorney, who is helping defend the county in the case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Creekman said soaring property values prompted double-digit tax increases on the Incline Village area in 2003 using methodologies that placed a premium on lake views and beaches. "Obviously, at Incline Village, the view and type of lake frontage plays a significant value in the property," said Josh Wilson, the current assessor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some homeowners considered the process unfair. Maryanne Ingemanson, 78, a retired concert pianist and developer, helped form the Nevada Property Tax Revolt, which filed multiple lawsuits challenging the tax system. From 2003 to 2006, the Nevada Supreme Court awarded $6.1 million in refunds to 1,200 homeowners who filed appeals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2010, the Incline Village group filed a suit in state district court that led to the Supreme Court's ruling ordering the $43 million in refunds. That award put an added strain on a county that has laid off a quarter of its work force since 2007 because of the weak economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">County officials declined to estimate how much more in tax-refund liability they could face in the case being heard Tuesday. "It's something that will impact us," said John Sherman, Washoe County's finance director.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A friend of ours quipped recently that Mitt Romney could do his Presidential candidacy a lot of good if he took even a single position that is unpopular in the polls. Well, we can report that he has done that on housing policy, that he's being pummeled for it, and that it may be his finest campaign hour. It also contrasts favorably with the latest temporary, ad hoc and futile housing effort from President Obama.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Campaigning last week in Nevada, the epicenter of the housing bust, Mr. Romney was asked by the Las Vegas Review-Journal editorial board what he would do about housing and foreclosures. His reply:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"One is, don't try and stop the foreclosure process. Let it run its course and hit the bottom. Allow investors to buy homes, put renters in them, fix the homes up. Let it turn around and come back up. The Obama Administration has slow-walked the foreclosure processes that have long existed, and as a result we still have a foreclosure overhang."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How's that for refreshing? After five years of politicians trying without success to levitate the housing market by postponing foreclosures, Mr. Romney dared to tell the truth. Parts of the U.S., including Nevada, still have too many homes, and that supply needs to be sold off and fixed up so the market can find a bottom before home prices can start to rise again. The faster that process proceeds, the faster the recovery will take hold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For this apostasy, Mr. Romney is getting whacked by the Democratic National Committee in a 30-second TV ad that first aired Tuesday in Arizona: "Almost half of Arizona homeowners underwater. Foreclosures everywhere. And what's Mitt Romney's plan?" the ad intones. Then it quotes Mr. Romney: "Don't try and stop the foreclosure process. Let it run its course and hit the bottom.'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The attack ad doesn't quote the second part of Mr. Romney's Las Vegas answer, which spoke another truth: "Number two, the credit [that] was given to first time homebuyers was insufficient and inadequate to turn around the housing market. I think it was an ineffective idea. It was a little bit like the cash-for-clunkers program, throwing government money at something which was not market-oriented, did not staunch the decline in home values anymore than it encouraged the auto industry to take off."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While he was at it, Mr. Romney might have added to his list of "ineffective" housing ideas the Bush Administration's Hope Now program, the Barney Frank-George W. Bush Hope for Homeowners plan, the Obama Administration Home Affordable Modification Program, the Emergency Homeowners' Loan Program, and, this week, an expanded version of the March 2009 Home Affordable Refinance Program (Harp).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of these government plans used taxpayer cash to forestall foreclosures in an attempt to stop housing prices from falling from their manic heights. How's that working out? Five years into the housing bust, the U.S. still has 10.9 million "underwater" borrowers, whose homes are worth less than the original purchase price. States like Florida, Nevada and New Jersey have long foreclosure backlogs, and home prices still haven't begun to recover in much of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Romney's advice to let the foreclosure and resale process take its course as rapidly as possible until the market finds a "bottom" couldn't possibly do any worse than the Obama Administration and its frenetic attempts to "save" homeowners have done. To the extent that it encourages a faster recovery it is also more compassionate. As the nearby chart shows, while the fall in home prices has been painful for current owners, it has also made housing far more affordable for new buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which brings us to the latest White House housing gesture, Harp II, to make it easier to refinance mortgages guaranteed by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. Harp I was supposed to help four to five million borrowers refinance, but only around 894,000 have used it so far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So why not double down on lack of success? Harp II will remove many of the restrictions on banks and borrowers that were contained in Harp I to protect taxpayers. These include removing the 125% loan-to-value ceiling for underwater borrowers, dealing with bank litigation concerns, and eliminating the need for a new appraisal. It also extends the end of the program to December 31, 2013, from next June 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No doubt this will help some homeowners refinance, especially with the Federal Reserve continuing to push long-bond rates even lower. But it is not a free lunch, especially for investors who hold mortgage-backed securities. Those securities will fall in value as borrowers prepay their old loans, and sure enough the MBS market fell out of bed after the White House announcement on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Congressional Budget Office tested an economic model of the mock refinancing plan in September and estimated that while government enterprises like Fannie and Freddie would save $3.9 billion from refinancing, they'd also lose $4.5 billion from the reduced value of their mortgage-backed securities. Pension funds, banks and others would lose as much as $15 billion. Such investors don't get any sympathy these days, but don't be surprised if they're skittish about re-entering America's politicized housing market in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for Mr. Romney, in his Vegas interview he did add briefly that "the idea of helping people refinance homes to stay in them is one that's worth further consideration," subject to more information. That's the poll-driven candidate talking, but for today let's congratulate the truth-teller.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Al Yoon   </div><div>774 words</div><div>28 October 2011</div><div>11:37</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK—Investing in the $5 trillion agency mortgage-backed securities market has long been a technician's game, with statistics and mathematical formulas frequently guiding investor decisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the last few years have seen greater uncertainty in predicting key variables—in particular how fast homeowners will repay their loans—because federal policy makers have repeatedly changed the rules of the mortgage game via the Obama administration's ad hoc remedies to housing-market woes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This has led dealers to retool, and investors to rethink, the mathematical models that for decades have sought to identify the most profitable bonds and warn against clunkers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FTN Financial mortgage strategist Walter Schmidt said an investor joked to him that one way to improve models would be to add an "Obama button" that could magically factor in the effect of White House policy changes wrought through the government's control of housing-finance giants <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's been an extremely challenging time to model" with policy changes, said Dale Westhoff, global head of structured product research at <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> in New York. In years past, there's been "nothing close" to the challenge faced by modelers today, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 21-year veteran of such models, he's not giving up, however. <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>'s seven-man modeling team is developing a second model that seeks to anticipate the effects of the Home Affordable Refinance Program, which aims to help about one million borrowers get new, cheaper loans by eliminating the home value from the mortgage approval process and easing liabilities banks face in extending such credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The right to refinance is common to most mortgages but is the primary risk in agency-issued mortgage-backed securities. Those bonds, issued by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, support most of the U.S. home loan market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage securities issued two or more years ago come with coupons, or nominal interest rates, far above what investors can earn today. To get them, some investors have paid more than the face value of the security. When the underlying loans are refinanced, however, they are paid back at par, or face value, which results in a loss to bondholders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Getting prepayment estimates wrong can be costly. For a typical portfolio of a real-estate investment trust, net margins on the 30-year, 4.5% mortgage security from <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> would fall to 1.21% from nearly 2% if the constant prepayment rate—a measure of mortgage prepayments as a percentage of the current outstanding loan balance—rose to 30% from 20%, according to a study by investor <span class="companylink">American Capital Agency Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate Obama program to let students with government education loans refinance also set analysts into action this week because it could help some asset-backed securities and hurt others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A measure of investor concern about faster home mortgage refinancing came this week as 300 investors listened in on a <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> conference call about HARP changes, more than usual, said Mr. Westhoff. Analysts are working "double-time" to get their new model up and running on Monday, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span> detailed its new model on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some investors said they might watch models but they haven't trusted the output, even before the more prominent role of government intervention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A September study by <span class="companylink">Pacific Investment Management Co</span>., whose Total Return Fund in September held $92 billion of mortgage securities, found estimates on option-adjusted spreads of <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> MBS of nine Wall Street firms varied as much as 0.76 percentage point from one another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the last 45 changes in some Wall Street models, 43 made the MBS appear cheaper, suggesting the changes are made to make bonds more attractive to investors, said Scott Simon, head of Pimco's mortgage- and asset-backed securities teams in Newport Beach, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You've got to acknowledge that what might look best in the model is not always where you want to take risk in your portfolio," said Tim Cunneen, a senior portfolio manager at Smith Breeden Associates in Durham, N.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Models are getting better all the time, though, said <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>'s Mr. Westhoff. Collecting data through the worst housing bust since the 1930s means analysts now have the benefit of information through periods where home prices were rising and refinancing was easy, and also when property values are falling and credit is lacking, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I am thoroughly convinced that on the other side of this we are going to have better models than we've ever had before," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fixed mortgage rates changed little over the past week after reports on the health of the U.S. economy showed mixed signals, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>'s weekly survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The latest monthly housing market indicators were mixed, with consumer confidence soft, house prices largely flat, and new home sales up from very low levels," said <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> Chief Economist Frank Nothaft.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as much of the nation's housing market remains tough, Silicon Valley's property scene has been relatively buoyant. That is apparent even in the highest end of the market in the exclusive town of Atherton, where numerous venture capitalists and top technology executives such as <span class="companylink">Hewlett-Packard Co</span>. chief executive Meg Whitman have homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, the median price of a home in Atherton was $3.2 million from January to August of this year, up 10.3% from $2.9 million in the same period a year ago, according to <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>. The town's median home price rose even though the number of property transactions—67 deals—stayed the same this year versus the same period last year, says <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast, the median sale price of a home in all of California over the same period fell 5.7% to $250,000 from $265,000, according to <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the home buyers in Atherton this year was Jeffrey Housenbold, CEO of online photo company <span class="companylink">Shutterfly Inc</span>., who purchased a $10.4 million property in May, according to public records. <span class="companylink">Google Inc</span>. engineering director Kourosh Gharachorloo also bought an Atherton home, shelling out $8.6 million in February, according to public records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representatives for Shutterfly and <span class="companylink">Google</span> declined to comment on the home purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local real-estate agents say the strong demand for properties in Atherton—which is centrally located and typically boasts relatively spacious one-acre lots for homes—has prompted a rush of builders to target new development in the town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wai H. Yip, a local builder, said he faced plenty of competition from other developers over an Atherton lot and house that he bought last year for around $3 million. Since then, he has torn down the house and is constructing a nearly 12,000-square-foot new one, which he aims to put on the market in 2012 for more than double what he paid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've already gotten [buyer] interest," Mr. Yip said. "The market is going strong."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But not all techie buyers are flocking to Atherton, said Silicon Valley real-estate agent Ken DeLeon of <span class="companylink">Keller Williams Realty</span>. In particular, Mr. DeLeon said he has been working with young employees from companies including <span class="companylink">Facebook Inc</span>. and that many of them are shying away from Atherton in favor of hipper places like Palo Alto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're less inclined to go to Atherton than successful CEOs and executives," said Mr. DeLeon. "They have a sense that Atherton is stuffy."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Businesses are stepping up investment, even as their overall orders for big-ticket items such as automobiles and aircraft dropped last month, new data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report offered a hint of optimism for the battered housing market as new-home sales ticked up 5.7% in September, the first increase in five months, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. New home sales are still on pace for the worst year on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New orders for durable goods—those designed to last longer than three years—fell by 0.8% in September to $200.3 billion, the Commerce Department said. But the decline was largely because of a slump in demand for airplanes, a category that tends to shift drastically from month to month even in a healthy economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Excluding transportation, the report was more promising: New orders rose 1.7%. Demand for nondefense-related capital goods excluding aircraft—an indicator of business investment—jumped 2.4%. Computers, electrical equipment and metals all showed strong gains. Shipments fell 0.7% last month after four months of increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in orders suggests companies are continuing to invest their cash despite a weak recovery, budget wars in Washington and economic turmoil in Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at <span class="companylink">High Frequency Economics Ltd</span>., said big companies are using substantial cash reserves to replace equipment but not necessarily to expand. "There's a sort of capital arms race, even if it's not an arms race toward expansion, but an arms race to keep up with the best of what's available. If you don't, you lose market share," Mr. Shepherdson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business has picked up at <span class="companylink">Paccar Inc</span>., a Bellevue, Wash., commercial-truck maker, which saw third-quarter earnings more than double, the company said Tuesday. Sales in the U.S. and Canada rose 80% from a year earlier as more customers replaced aging fleets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's been an up-and-down decade for many of them, but those that have survived are well positioned," Chief Executive Mark Pigott said in a conference call Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Europe's economic turmoil increases uncertainty for manufactures such as Paccar, which is ratcheting back its European production. Still, the company has expansion plans in the works and estimates it will spend between $450 million and $550 million on capital projects in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market, which has notched some minor improvements, continues to weigh on the recovery. Last month's increase in new-home sales was the strongest pace since April. But prices kept falling, and the new seasonally adjusted annual rate of 313,000 units sold puts the market on pace for the worst sales year since record-keeping began in 1963.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales remain about a quarter of their peak before the housing bubble started deflating around five years ago. Sales are far below healthy levels, considered to be an annual rate of around 750,000, and are still 0.9% below year-ago levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another bid to stabilize the sector, the Obama administration and a U.S. housing regulator this week unveiled a plan to let borrowers refinance regardless of how far their homes have fallen in value.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Josh Barbanel   </div><div>527 words</div><div>27 October 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A24</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After lingering on the market for a year, a newly renovated beach house in Sagaponack owned by Scott N. Resnick, a scion of the Resnick real-estate family, sold last month for $24 million, $6 million more than he paid for it in 2007 near the peak of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That sale is part of a rebound in pricier Hamptons homes that began in the spring and continued into the fall, despite the challenging larger environment for sales across the region. Median prices fell compared with the second quarter, but were far above levels reported in the same quarter in 2010, according to reports released Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is a lot going on in the high end, someone's got to be making money, said John Healey, a broker at Town &amp; Country Real Estate who listed Mr. Resnick's modern seven-bedroom home with pool. That sale was the most expensive closed sale in the third quarter, reported to date.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He attributed much of the increase in price for Mr. Resnick's home at 137 Crestview Lane, on a major renovation that took so long that the sellers outgrew the space. Mr. Resnick didn't return a request for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price in the Hamptons was $850,000, according to a report by Prudential Douglas Elliman, down 9.3% from the second quarter, but up 22.1% from the same period in 2010, a particularly weak quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan Miller, an appraiser and president of Miller Samuel, said that there were 30 sales reported for more than $5 million in the third quarter, the second highest total since the financial crisis in the fall of 2008. But taking out the luxury boomlet, prices in the Hamptons and across Long Island were at best essentially stable, with "a modest uptick in activity," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cia Comnas, who manages East End offices for Brown Harris Stevens, said that despite a "return of investor confidence in the high-end Hampton properties," the market remains challenging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the overall increase in sales compared to a year earlier, a report by Brown Harris Stevens flagged the relative weakness in lower priced apartments. It found that homes that sold for less than $1 million made up 57% of the market in the third quarter compared to 67% in the same quarter, as sales of more expensive apartments rose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts noted that the quarterly shifts in sales and prices were also influenced by federal policy, the expiration of federal tax credits for home purchases and a rush to sell expensive properties last year, out of a fear that the federal capital gains tax rate would rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A number of other top sales in the third quarter were for large houses fronting or near the beach in Southampton Village and in Sagaponack.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Susan Breichtenbach, a broker with <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span> in Bridgehampton, said that while the inventory of luxury houses remains high in the Hamptons, there was a strong demand for unusual oceanfront properties, if they were priced right. "There is some money out there," she said.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Apartment Values Rise, as Do Rents</span>
</div><div class="author">By Dawn Wotapka   </div><div>905 words</div><div>26 October 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strong growth of rents and occupancy levels of rental apartments have pushed some building values to record levels as Americans shift away from home ownership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While concerns about the economy are cooling the market for most other types of commercial real estate, apartment rents and occupancies continue to be boosted by demand from millions of people who are victims of foreclosure or are unwilling or unable to buy their own homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of the third quarter, 5.6% of the nation's apartments were vacant, down from 5.9% in the second quarter, and the lowest level since 2006, according to <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>., a real-estate data service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rents are up even in some cities that have been hard hit by high unemployment and the housing crash, like Orlando, Fla., Detroit and Phoenix. Effective rents, which include landlord discounts in some markets, rose to $1,004 a month in the third quarter, up 2.3% from a year earlier, according to Reis. Of the 82 major markets that Reis tracks, only Las Vegas saw rents decline compared with a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forecasters say rent increases could slow or stop if the economy weakens further. But for now, these trends are producing outsized returns for real-estate companies, compared with other commercial-property classes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Values of apartment buildings in the best locations—with modern amenities like resort-style swimming pools and outdoor movie viewing areas—went into record territory in the third quarter, according to an index compiled by Green Street Advisors. The previous record had been set in the second quarter of 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors who bought apartment buildings just a few years ago are selling for big profits. Regency Club, a 372-unit complex in Jackson, N.J., with two swimming pools and tennis courts, sold for $44 million in August, compared with $39.9 million in early 2009, according to Marcus &amp; Millichap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, though, the rise in rents is squeezing large swathes of the middle class by increasing living costs just as wage increases are anemic and unemployment high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Glen Guile, a 40-year-old information technology and marketing employee for an auto-parts company in Raleigh, N.C., says he's looking on <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span>, an online classified-ad service, for a roommate because he just heard his $629 rent for a one-bedroom apartment could be increased another $30 to $40 a month. He's already working a second job at a <span class="companylink">Costco</span> store. "I don't get a day off. I work seven days a week," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But thanks to rising rents and occupancies, some analysts predict that real-estate companies will have the highest growth in property net income this year and next year since 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Associated Estates Realty Corp</span>. kicked off the earnings season for apartment-building companies Monday by reporting a 12.5% year-over-year increase in funds from operations, a common metric used by real-estate companies to measure performance. When looking at apartments owned for a year or more, rents for Associated's 12,000-unit portfolio were up 4.6% compared with the third quarter of 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Some people try to make the argument that what's going on in the job market affects apartment demand," said Jeffrey Friedman, Associated's chief executive. "We don't believe that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment sector has been insulated from high unemployment because it continues to inhabit a sweet spot in the economy created by demographic factors and the anemic home sales market. The U.S. is expected to see 1.5 million rental household formations in 2011, a record year, according to Green Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main reason for the rental increase is a faster-than-expected decline in the home ownership rate, according to Green Street. The nation's rate came in at 66% in the second quarter, down from 66.4% in the first quarter and 66.9% in the second quarter a year ago, according to the Census Bureau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some industry watchers say the rate could fall to as low as 60%. Each 1% decline in the home-ownership rate represents the movement of one million households to rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a current tenant balks about a lease renewal including higher rent, Mr. Friedman says he isn't overly concerned. "There's someone coming right behind them who can afford it," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, the economics of apartment investments aren't detached from the concerns about financial problems in Europe and the possibility of a double-dip recession in the U.S. As a result, landlords have started to temper rent growth in some areas, including Denver, Atlanta and the Baltimore area, according to Green Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If another recession hits and unemployment rises, millions of renters could likely double up or move home with their parents, putting a crimp in demand. "People just aren't going to write bigger and bigger rent checks into infinity," warns Andrew McCulloch a Green Street analyst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The high rents are also being supported by a lack of new supply. Developers have scrambled to launch new projects, but most of them won't start hitting the market until late 2012. Roughly 8,200 new apartments hit the market in the third quarter, the second lowest number since Reis began tracking data in 1999.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices inched 0.2% higher in August but declined 3.8% on an annual basis, according to a closely watched index released Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ten of the 20 cities in the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller composite index also posted gains in August, signaling some improvement in the battered real-estate sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In August, we see a modest glimmer of hope with these data," said David M. Blitzer, chairman of the Index Committee. Still, prices remained essentially flat on a seasonally adjusted basis and even Mr. Blitzer forecast a long slog to recovery. "In spring and summer's seasonally strong period for housing demand, we cautioned that monthly increases in prices had to be paired with improvement in annual rates before anyone could declare that the market might be stabilizing," he said. "Nationally, home prices are still below where they were a year ago."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another monthly index released Tuesday showed similar weakness. The <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> said home prices slipped 0.1% on a seasonally adjusted basis, and 4% over the prior year; the index is calculated from the purchase prices of homes backed by mortgages sold to or guaranteed by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> or <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Together, the home-price measures drew a pessimistic reaction from industry watchers. "We believe national home prices have further to fall," a <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> Merrill Lynch Global Research report said. "The continued decline in home prices is a function of the large imbalance between supply and demand in the housing market. There is too much inventory, particularly of distressed properties, relative to the pace of home sales, which means that prices must fall further to equilibrate the market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, in the Case-Shiller index, Detroit and Washington were the only cities to post annual growth; the Midwest—specifically Chicago, Detroit and Minneapolis—showed sharp monthly increases. Economists attribute this to some pickup in hiring in the automotive sector. In Chicago, first-time and luxury buyers are jump-starting the market, says Mark Pullinger, a spokesman for Koenig &amp; Strey Real Living, a large brokerage in the area. "Inventory is down substantially, so it's being driven by…bargain hunters," he said. "There are areas that if you ever wanted to live in, now is the time to buy because the prices are relatively low. … The people in the middle are a little bit stuck. Their homes are not worth what they paid for them recently, so it's tough to move up."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller data come on the heels of the White House's revamp of a mortgage-refinance program for "underwater" borrowers—those who owe more than their homes are worth. But economists say there are few quick fixes for the housing crisis, and easier refinancing rules will do little to address weak demandfor homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was a very bad spring-to-summer-market season," saidNancy Wallace, a finance professor at the University of California at Berkeley. She, said a turnaround in the housingmarket remains largely dependent on a loosening of credit and a surge in hiring. "People are almost afraid to apply for mortgages and lots of people have little scratches and dents on their credit right now," she said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos </div><div>657 words</div><div>25 October 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government's revamped mortgage-refinancing program could allow more than a million borrowers to take advantage of falling interest rates, even if the value of their homes has plummeted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the plan, announced as expected on Monday, could provide a modest boost to spending and some relief to homeowners, economists said more action may be needed to stabilize the ailing housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overhaul of the Home Affordable Refinance Program, or HARP, will let borrowers whose mortgages are backed by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> refinance, regardless of how far their homes' values have fallen, eliminating a previous limit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you meet certain requirements, you will have the chance to refinance at lower rates, which could save you hundreds of dollars a month, and thousands of dollars a year in mortgage payments," President Barack Obama said during a speech Monday in Las Vegas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday's changes will allow borrowers to refinance their mortgages regardless of how far home prices have plunged in any given market. Loans that exceed the current 125% loan-to-value limit won't be eligible to refinance until early next year, officials said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other homeowners will still be left out, including those whose mortgages aren't guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie and those who took out mortgages in the past 2 1/2 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama unveiled HARP one month into his presidency. But so far, only 894,000 borrowers have used it, of which just 70,000 are significantly underwater, or owe more than their homes are worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ultimate success of the effort depends on how lenders handle a batch of policy revisions, some of which have yet to be spelled out. While the changes announced Monday are a "very positive step, it isn't a magic bullet," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics. "Policymakers will thus very likely have to do more to support the housing market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some critics have warned of unintended consequences to mortgage markets if investors worry that political intervention will lead mortgage-backed securities to pay off sooner than expected as loans refinance, leaving investors with cash to invest at lower rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rep. Spencer Bachus (R., Ala.), the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, criticized the refinance plan on Monday. "This is another example of the administration picking winners and losers," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The policy tweaks won't do much to improve the equity position of about 11 million borrowers who are underwater, and they won't help boost underlying housing demand, which remains depressed.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos   </div><div>940 words</div><div>25 October 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government's revamped mortgage-refinancing program could allow more than a million borrowers to take advantage of falling interest rates, even if the value of their homes has plummeted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the plan, announced as expected on Monday, could provide a modest boost to spending and some relief to homeowners, economists said more action may be needed to stabilize the ailing housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overhaul of the Home Affordable Refinance Program, or HARP, will let borrowers whose mortgages are backed by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> refinance, regardless of how far their homes' values have fallen, eliminating a previous limit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you meet certain requirements, you will have the chance to refinance at lower rates, which could save you hundreds of dollars a month, and thousands of dollars a year in mortgage payments," President Barack Obama said during a speech Monday in Las Vegas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration has been criticized for housing-relief programs that failed to meet announced goals, and declined Monday to provide estimates of how many borrowers might be helped by the latest effort. Analysts at <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span> estimate that between two million and three million borrowers could be eligible under the revamp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday's changes will allow borrowers to refinance their mortgages regardless of how far home prices have plunged in any given market. Loans that exceed the current 125% loan-to-value limit won't be eligible to refinance until early next year, officials said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other homeowners will still be left out, including those whose mortgages aren't guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie and those who took out mortgages in the past 2½ years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama unveiled HARP one month into his presidency. But so far, only 894,000 borrowers have used it, of which just 70,000 are significantly underwater, or owe more than their homes are worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ultimate success of the effort depends on how lenders handle a batch of policy revisions, some of which have yet to be spelled out. While the changes announced Monday are a "very positive step, it isn't a magic bullet," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics. "Policymakers will thus very likely have to do more to support the housing market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some critics have warned of unintended consequences to mortgage markets if investors worry that political intervention will lead mortgage-backed securities to pay off sooner than expected as loans refinance, leaving investors with cash to invest at lower rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rep. Spencer Bachus (R., Ala.), the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, criticized the refinance plan on Monday. "This is another example of the administration picking winners and losers," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The policy tweaks won't do much to improve the equity position of about 11 million borrowers who are underwater, and they won't help boost underlying housing demand, which remains depressed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York Fed President William Dudley said the changes were "a step in the right direction" but said a "comprehensive approach" was needed to stabilize home prices.Mr. Dudley is one of several Fed officials who in recent days have called for more urgent action to help housing. Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo last week urged the central bank to resume large-scale purchases of mortgage-backed securities to drive mortgage rates even lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said one of the most important changes in the refinance rules Monday concerned "buy-backs," where banks are forced to repurchase from Fannie and Freddie defaulted loans with underwriting flaws. That has discouraged many lenders from refinancing all but the safest loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks "will sit on the sidelines as long as they fear" that refinancing will put them at risk, said Gene Sperling, the president's top economic adviser. Mr. Sperling said the decision by the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span>, which regulates Fannie and Freddie, to offer a substantial waiver from potential put-backs on HARP loans created the potential to "unleash" more refinancing. On Monday, call volume at the <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> mortgage offices was "higher than usual," a spokeswoman said, and the bank was taking steps to put special teams in place "to respond to greater volume in the days ahead."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The changes should help borrowers like James Sims of Fairfield, Ohio, who has a Fannie-guaranteed mortgage with a 6.16% rate. He meets the guidelines of the HARP program but because he has mortgage insurance, he had been told earlier he had to refinance with the company that services his mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's a problem because the servicing company, Seterus Inc., a unit of <span class="companylink">International Business Machines Corp</span>, doesn't make loans. "I've just kind of given up on it," Mr. Sims said. Seterus declined to comment. Under the new changes, Mr. Sims should now be able to go to any lender to refinance his mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The change should help many borrowers in the hardest-hit housing markets. Ronald Gallagher's daughter, a single mother of two and a nurse, made a 25% down payment when she bought her Phoenix house five years ago. Today she owes around 50% more than the property's estimated value of $142,000, leaving her too far underwater to refinance, under earlier rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her mortgage, which is backed by Freddie, will reset next year to a variable rate. If she were able to refinance, "I can guarantee you ... she'd be buying stuff that she isn't able to buy right now," such as new carpet for her home, said Mr. Gallagher.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Barack Obama on Monday went where his Republican White House rivals have so far refused to go. He asserted that Washington should help Americans refinance their mortgages at lower rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The president's move to expand an existing, little-used program underscored his administration's belief that government has a role to play in restoring the health of the nation's broken housing market. In contrast, Republican presidential hopefuls have been reluctant to address the housing issue, in part because they blame government for causing the financial crisis and housing mess.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, Republican presidential candidate John McCain proposed that the government buy up home mortgages that exceeded the value of houses, then re-issue them at market value. "He got killed," said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, the economic adviser who had urged Mr. McCain to make the proposal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Months later, the tea-party movement took off after CNBC analyst Rick Santelli's on-air tirade in February 2009 about the new Obama administration's suggestion that it would try to aid homeowners. "How many of you people want to pay for your neighbor's mortgage that has an extra bathroom and can't pay their bills?" he asked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ever since, politicians from both parties have feared aggressive action that would smack of welfare for McMansion dwellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in economic circles, calls for a more aggressive approach to the housing crisis are bipartisan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The president's latest refinancing plan was based in part on a proposal by R. Glenn Hubbard, Columbia University's business-school dean and a senior economic adviser to Republican front-runner Mitt Romney.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the president's effort "is the mass refinancing we suggest, it could be a very big deal," Mr. Hubbard said in an interview Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Georgia Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson, who has a similar proposal, called the Obama plan "a no-brainer."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harvard University economist Martin Feldstein, a senior adviser to Ronald Reagan, called for more aggressive government action earlier this month. The government, he said, should reduce the principal amount owed on mortgages to no more than 110% of the value of a house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Romney, meeting with the Las Vegas Review Journal last week, took a different approach. "Don't try and stop the foreclosure process. Let it run its course and hit the bottom, allow investors to buy homes, put renters in them, fix the homes up, and let it turn around," Mr. Romney counseled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Romney said the Obama administration's efforts to that point had only "slow-walked" the foreclosure process and left an "overhang" of homeowners treading water with mortgages worth more than their homes, waiting for a rescue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These may have been the most detailed Republican comments on housing so far in the 2012 race.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Romney's 59-point economic plan didn't include a point on housing. Instead, Republican candidates have tended to criticize government-sponsored enterprises <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> for fueling the housing bubble by facilitating home loans made to people with shaky credit. And many congressional Republicans have said that Mr. Obama's previous housing programs have failed to help the housing market in any meaningful way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing issue hasn't come up much during GOP presidential debates. In one instance when it did, Texas Rep. Ron Paul said the government should stand aside and let home prices continue to fall until the existing property becomes a good value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two candidates who have offered plans to address the housing crisis—Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann and former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr.—call for privatizing <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, which hold an estimated 70% of home loans in the U.S., and were taken over by the government during the 2008 crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage- and housing-industry lobbyists warn that removing the government backstop is unrealistic and could send mortgage rates soaring. And bills to transform Fannie and Freddie into private companies remain stalled even in the Republican-run House.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Romney and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich are both planning to offer detailed plans to address the housing crisis in the weeks ahead, campaign aides said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gingrich is the rare Republican who would support additional government intervention. He recently told the Las Vegas Sun that he wants to minimize foreclosures and favors a plan that would "make it profitable for banks" to renegotiate mortgages for homeowners who are struggling to make payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether Republicans even need to devise housing proposals during the campaign is a subject of debate in the GOP. Mr. Holtz-Eakin said the 2012 campaign will be a referendum on Mr. Obama's stewardship, so he has to look like he's doing something. "That's the politics for him. That's not the politics for everyone else," Mr. Holtz-Eakin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But people in hard-hit swing states may be looking for more. Brandon Lima, 22, moved to Roosevelt, Utah, from Nevada to find work. Standing outside Mr. Obama's Las Vegas housing-policy rollout, he said he voted for the president in 2008 but wasn't so sure now. "They've been talking about [the housing crisis] for a long time. People want to see action. It's actually time to take action," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Isakson agreed. "Whether you're a candidate for president or the president himself, and we're in a housing recession like we're in now, if you don't have a policy and don't have solutions, you're in trouble," he said.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Senators for McMansion Subsidies; The housing lobby strikes again.</span>
</div><div>583 words</div><div>25 October 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>13</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should taxpayers continue to guarantee personal McMansions, even as <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> have lost $142 billion, and counting? Homeowners who lived through the recent government-backed housing boom and bust would say no, but for Senate Democrats and a clutch of Republicans in hock to the housing lobby, the answer is a resounding yes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's a reference to Thursday night's 60-38 vote in favor of a measure to raise "conforming loan limits" for Fannie, Freddie and the Federal Housing Administration to $729,750 in certain markets for two more years. The limits dictate the size of mortgage that each agency is allowed to guarantee, and they had been reduced earlier this month as planned under previous law to $625,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing lobby claims that reducing the loan limits would, as National Association of Home Builders Chairman Bob Nielsen said in a statement Friday, "reduce housing demand, and place downward pressure on home prices in major markets. This will exacerbate the current housing downturn, trigger more foreclosures, impede job growth and endanger the fragile economic recovery." The home builders have never seen a subsidy they didn't like, no matter how healthy the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the Obama Administration recognized this subsidy train can't last forever if we want to reduce the role of government in housing markets. So it pledged in its February white paper on Fan and Fed to reduce the limits so "larger loans for more expensive homes will once again be funded only through the private market." Funny, then, that the White House didn't do more to stop Senate Democrats from repudiating this pledge. Must be an election coming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Equally egregious are the eight Republicans who joined 52 Democrats in voting for the loan limits; see the list nearby. Massachusetts's Scott Brown probably figured he had to appease the housing lobby before his re-election campaign next year. Georgia Senator and former realtor Johnny Isakson has been in cahoots with the housing lobby and against reform for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Missouri Senator Roy Blunt is harder to explain. A spokeswoman put it this way: "Senator Blunt voted for this amendment because he believes the last thing our nation's housing market needs right now is greater uncertainty. The market today is arguably worse than when these loan limits were originally increased in 2008 and allowing this deadline to arbitrarily expire will only create a more stagnant environment for Americans who are trying to get an affordable loan."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, one reason it is "arguably worse" is because government keeps contributing to "greater uncertainty" by intervening in the housing market. If anything is certain in politics it is that the housing lobby will want to extend the higher limits forever if Senators like Mr. Blunt will oblige.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the private-market securitization market is finally showing signs of life. Redwood Trust, for instance, has brought two private-market deals this year. And by the way, the average sales price for existing homes in September was $212,700, according to the National Association of Realtors. That's a long way from $729,750.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More courageous are the Republicans who voted against the amendment who come from states with the most battered housing markets, such as Florida's Marco Rubio and Arizona's Jon Kyl and John McCain. House Republicans should follow their lead, but never underestimate the housing lobby's ability to stage a taxpayer ambush.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes slipped in September as Americans were hit by economic uncertainty, high unemployment and tight lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales dropped 3% to a seasonally adjusted 4.91 million in September, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. That followed a sales bump in August, as the housing market remains stuck in neutral despite lower prices and interest rates at near-historic lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, a Labor Department report hinted at modest growth in the job market, showing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped by 6,000 last week to 403,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reports highlight two critical drags on the economy: a broken housing market and mediocre employment gains. This summer's fears of the U.S.'s slipping into another recession appear to have ebbed, but businesses and consumers are bracing for a slow, extended economic-healing process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We reversed the trend, and we're going back to where we were prior to the summer lull," David Resler of Nomura Global Economics said after the release of the jobless claims. But looking ahead, he added, "It's going to be a long slog."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home-sales report comes amid a standoff between potential home buyers skittish about the economy and sellers resistant to lowering their prices further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the housing market has regained some ground -- existing-home sales were up 11.3% in September compared with a year ago -- foreclosure properties are weighing on prices, and high unemployment is breeding caution and keeping some buyers on the sidelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national median price for existing homes fell to $165,400 in September, a 3.5% drop from a year earlier, the Realtors association said. Housing inventory fell last month, leaving the equivalent of an 8 1/2-month supply at the current sales pace. That means it would take about that long to sell the current inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales rose in the Northeast last month but declined in the Midwest, South and West. The report only counts homes at the closing of a sale, which can come months after an agreement to sell and sometimes lags behind current conditions in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chicago real-estate agent Ron Abrams, treasurer of the Chicago Association of Realtors, said sales were up slightly in the city in September but aren't where they need to be to signal a healthy recovery. He said rents are up in the city, a sign that potential home buyers are waiting for more signs of economic improvement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're dealing with national economic problems, international economic problems, job problems. And we need to see the banks loosen lending and deal with the foreclosure problems that they have," Mr. Abrams said. "Once we move past those things, I think we can move freely."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New jobless claims for the week ended Saturday remained stuck above the 400,000 benchmark. Economists say that when claims fall below that level, the economy is creating more jobs than it is shedding. But the drop indicated slight improvement, and the four-week average, a less-volatile measure, edged down by 6,250 to 403,000, the lowest level since mid-April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists hailed the numbers as the latest sign of stability, if not modest job growth. Unemployment is at 9.1% as many companies have a wait-and-see approach to hiring amid a slow rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy appears poised for modest growth for the rest of 2011, a separate report showed, though it could be easily derailed in its fragile state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conference Board said its Leading Economic Index, designed to predict where the economy is headed, rose 0.2% in September to 116.4, following increases in August and July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Conference Board economist, Ken Goldstein, said low confidence among consumers, businesses and investors could worsen and potentially tip the economy into recession. "The probability of a downturn starting over the next few months remains at about 50%," he wrote.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos   </div><div>917 words</div><div>21 October 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>10</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reeling housing market has come to this: To shore it up, two Senators introduced a bipartisan bill Thursday that would give residence visas to foreigners who spend at least $500,000 to buy houses in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The provision is part of a larger package of immigration measures, co-authored by Sens. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) and Mike Lee (R., Utah), designed to spur more foreign investment in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreigners have accounted for a growing share of home purchases in South Florida, Southern California, Arizona and other hard-hit markets. Chinese and Canadian buyers, among others, are taking advantage not only of big declines in U.S. home prices and reduced competition from Americans but also of favorable foreign-exchange rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To fuel this demand, the proposed measure would offer visas to any foreigner making a cash investment of at least $500,000 on residential real estate -- a single-family house, condo or town house. Applicants can spend the entire amount on one house or spend as little as $250,000 on a residence and invest the rest in other residential real estate, which can be rented out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The measure would complement existing visa programs that allow foreigners to enter the U.S. if they invest in new businesses that create jobs. Backers believe the initiative would help soak up an excess supply of inventory when many would-be American home buyers are holding back because they are concerned about their jobs or because they would have to take a big loss to sell their current house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is a way to create more demand without costing the federal government a nickel," Sen. Schumer said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">International buyers accounted for about $82 billion in U.S. residential-real-estate sales for the year ending in March, up from $66 billion during the previous-year period, according to data from the National Association of Realtors. Foreign buyers accounted for at least 5.5% of all home sales in Miami and 4.3% of Phoenix home sales during the month of July, according to MDA <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreigners immigrating to the U.S. with the new visa wouldn't be able to work here unless they obtained a regular work visa through the normal process. They would be allowed to bring a spouse and any children under the age of 18, but they wouldn't be able to stay in the country legally on the new visa once they sold their properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The provision would create visas that are separate from current programs so as to not displace anyone waiting for other visas. There would be no cap on the home-buyer visa program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past year, Canadians accounted for one-quarter of foreign home buyers, and buyers from China, Mexico, Great Britain and India accounted for another quarter, according to the National Association of Realtors. For buyers from some countries, restrictive immigration rules are "a deterrent to purchase here, for sure," says Sally Daley, a real-estate agent in Vero Beach, Fla. She estimates that about one-third of her sales this year have gone to foreigners, an all-time high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Without them, we would be stagnant," says Ms. Daley. "They're hiring contractors, buying furniture, and they're also helping the market correct by getting inventory whittled down."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, Harry Morrison, a Canadian from Lakefield, Ontario, bought a four-bedroom vacation home in a gated community in Vero Beach. "House prices were going down, and the exchange rate was quite favorable," said Mr. Morrison, who first bought a home there from Ms. Daley four years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a special visa would allow Canadian buyers like Mr. Morrison to spend more time in the U.S., he said he isn't sure "what other benefit a visa would give me."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea has some high-profile supporters, including Warren Buffett, who this summer floated the idea of encouraging more "rich immigrants" to buy homes. "If you wanted to change your immigration policy so that you let 500,000 families in but they have to have a significant net worth and everything, you'd solve things very quickly," Mr. Buffett said in an August interview with PBS's Charlie Rose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The measure could also help turn around buyer psychology, said mortgage-bond pioneer Lewis Ranieri. He said the program represented "triage" for a housing market that needs more fixes, even modest ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But other industry executives greeted the proposal with skepticism. Foreign buyers "don't need an incentive" to buy homes, said Richard Smith, chief executive of <span class="companylink">Realogy Corp</span>., which owns the Coldwell Banker and Century 21 real-estate brands. "We have a lot of Americans who are willing to buy. We just have to fix the economy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The measure may have a more targeted effect in exclusive markets, like San Marino, Calif., that have become popular with foreigners. Easier immigration rules could be "tremendous" because of the difficulty many Chinese buyers have in obtaining visas, says Maggie Navarro, a local real-estate agent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Navarro recently sold a home for $1.67 million, about 8% more than the asking price, to a Chinese national who works in the mining industry. She says nearly every listing she has put on the market in San Marino "has had at least one full-price cash offer from a buyer from mainland China."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Damian Paletta and Sara Murray </div><div>873 words</div><div>20 October 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans' everyday costs ticked up last month, further straining households coping with lackluster wage growth and leading to the first cost-of-living increase in two years for millions of people who receive government benefits pegged to inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer prices rose 0.3% in September, the Labor Department said Wednesday, and were up 3.9% year over year. The 12-month increase -- the largest since September 2008 -- stemmed from a jump in gasoline prices related to the Arab Spring. Higher prices at the pump earlier this year taxed households hit by high unemployment and lower home values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Excluding food and energy, prices rose 0.1% last month and were up 2% for the 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The climb in prices means millions of Americans who rely on government programs such as Social Security will receive their first cost-of-living increase since 2009. It also will raise taxes on close to 10 million of the 161 million workers who pay Social Security taxes. That's because in 2012, Americans will have to pay the payroll tax on their first $110,100 in earnings, up from the $106,800 in earnings in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly 55 million Social Security beneficiaries will see their checks rise by 3.6% beginning in January, the Social Security Administration said. For the more than eight million recipients of Supplemental Security Income -- assistance for the poor and disabled -- the increase will start in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 3.6% increase could be partially or completely offset by a bump in the premiums that seniors pay for Medicare Part B benefits, which have been held flat for many beneficiaries because of low inflation in the last two years. For many retired Americans, Social Security benefits come in around $1,000 a month, and Medicare premiums can eat up 10% of that or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services could announce their premiums and copayments for 2012 as soon as next week. Because Medicare premiums are deducted directly from Social Security checks, many Americans may never see an increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's very difficult to make your ends meet," said June Engelhardt, 79, who volunteers at a senior center in Toledo, Ohio. She said that without Social Security she would be "out on the street. I live in a mobile home and my rent is $225 a month. Otherwise, I'm squeaking through."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Social Security checks are vital to many American households: 20.3 million more people would have fallen below the government's official poverty line last year without the payments, according the Census Bureau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a joke," said Pete Morelli, 80, of his cost-of-living increase being offset by the Medicare increase. "They are going to give us a little extra money and then raise our insurances. That's ridiculous." Mr. Morelli moved to Williamsburg, Va., several years ago after retiring as a mechanic and school bus driver in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others affected by the cost-of-living increase include roughly 2.3 million retired federal civil servants, and close to two million more retired members of the military. It could also draw attention on Capitol Hill, as lawmakers look for ways to trim the budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, the White House and congressional Republicans debated whether to shift toward a more-conservative inflation measurement that would likely have cost-of-living adjustments move up much more slowly. Budget forecasters have projected that moving to this formula could save roughly $300 billion over 10 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While those relying on programs such as Social Security may see an income boost, most other Americans are coping with falling incomes and rising prices. Higher prices eat into consumers' purchasing power, which plays a prominent role in economic recovery because it accounts for 70% of economic activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real average weekly earnings fell 1.7% over the past year, the Labor Department said Wednesday. Meanwhile, prices for everyday staples rose. Food prices climbed 0.4% last month and the cost of transportation, medical care and shelter also rose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Firming prices make it more difficult for the Federal Reserve to calibrate its monetary stimulus so that it boosts the economy and jobs without spurring too much inflation. The Fed believes inflation will slow after a spike earlier this year as lower prices for oil and other commodities work their way through the economy. High unemployment should make it harder for companies to raise prices and workers to demand higher pay, keeping inflation at bay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hints of that emerged in Wednesday's report as used-vehicle costs fell and apparel prices dropped a sharp 1.1%, an indication that clothing retailers have had a tough time passing price increases on to shoppers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report showed new residential construction climbed 15% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 658,000 in September from a month earlier. Most of the jump came from multifamily housing construction, which tends to be more volatile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of single-family homes, which make up the majority of the housing market, rose 1.7% to a rate of 425,000.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously occupied homes in the U.S. fell slightly last month, a sign of continuing weakness in a depressed part of the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales decreased by 3.0% in September from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.91 million, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. August's sales pace was revised upward to 5.06 million per year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had expected home sales to fall by 2.6% to an annual rate of 4.90 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market is "in a holding pattern. It's not breaking out," said Lawrence Yun, the trade group's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales were up 11.3% from the same month a year earlier. The median sales price was $165,400, down 3.5% from $171,400 a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of previously owned homes listed for sale, meanwhile, fell at the end of September to 3.48 million. That represented an 8.5-month supply at the current sales pace, compared with a healthy level of about six months. Foreclosures and other distressed properties represented about 30% of sales, the Realtors group said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than five years after the housing bubble started to burst,the housing market remains a heavy burden on the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A massive supply of foreclosed properties and a shortage of buyers who are able to purchase a home amid tight lending standards are holding down prices in much of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, consumers remain uncertain about whether the market will take another turn for the worse and are hesitant about making a big purchase. Mortgage lending for home purchases was at the lowest point in nearly 15 years last week, despite mortgage rates that have been hovering above record lows, the Mortgage Bankers Association said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the market struggling, home builders have stayed away from the single-family market. While overall home building grew in September to the highest level in 17 months, the jump came largely from construction of multifamily homes, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market in many parts of the country has been facing renewed pressure this fall, now that the maximum size of loans that can be backed by government controlled mortgage companies <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and the Federal Housing Administration has fallen. The limits, which went into effect at the start of this month, vary by location but are now $625,500 in expensive markets such as New York and San Francisco, down from $729,750.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senate lawmakers, especially ones from high-cost markets on the East and West coasts, have been pushing to restore the former limits -- a move strongly backed by the Realtors group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors group conducted a survey of about 1,300 real estate agents in nearly 670 counties affected by the change. It found that 16% of potential buyers dropped out of the home buying process due to the loan limit change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of those borrowers can't afford higher down payments that are required for loans that don't receive government backing, Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors' report said home sales fell last month compared with a month earlier in three out of four regions. Sales were down 8.8% in the West, 2.6% in the South and 0.9% in the Midwest. Sales rose 2.6% in the Northeast.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Eric Morath and Alan Zibel   </div><div>748 words</div><div>20 October 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>11</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cost of living in the U.S. kept rising in September, led by continued increases in food and energy prices, posing another challenge for Americans struggling with a weak job market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising prices for food, shelter and other necessities led to the first cost-of-living increase in Social Security benefits since 2009. The more than 60 million Americans who receive Social Security will see their checks increase by 3.6%, the government said, but the increase will largely be offset by higher medical-care costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer prices last month rose a seasonally adjusted 0.3% from August, the third straight monthly increase, the Labor Department said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, U.S. home building grew in September to the highest level in 17 months. The results, however, were driven by a more than 50% monthly increase in construction of multifamily homes with at least two units, a volatile part of the market. Construction of single-family homes rose by 1.7% from a month earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weak housing market is a key concern to economic policy makers, and Fed officials monitor the consumer price data for any signs of inflation. That's because higher prices eat into the purchasing power of many Americans already struggling to find a job or to get a pay increase. Fed officials need to calibrate their interest-rate policy so that it boosts the economy and jobs without spurring too much inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Underlying inflation, which excludes energy and food costs that can be volatile and which the Fed considers a better predictor of price trends, rose 0.1% in September. The modest increase "should ease fears among the more hawkish Fed officials that underlying inflation is spiraling out of control," said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with a year earlier, consumer prices as calculated by the main index rose by 3.9% in September. It was the highest level in three years and above the Fed's comfort zone of close to 2.0%. Underlying consumer prices, however, were up by a more tame 2.0% year-on-year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed believes inflation will slow after a spike earlier this year as lower prices for oil and other commodities work their way through a feeble economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High unemployment -- the rate was stuck above 9.0% in September -- should make it harder for companies to raise prices and for workers to demand higher pay, keeping inflation at bay. However, Wednesday's report showed little sign of an inflation slowdown in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Food and energy drove the increases. Food costs rose by a monthly 0.4% and energy prices were up by 2.0% last month from August. Apparel and new vehicle prices, however, both fell in September after several months of increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Upward pressures are also expected to remain in the rental housing market, which accounts for about one-third of the consumer price index, as many consumers decide to rent instead of purchasing a home. Average apartment rents after discounts rose to $1,004 nationwide in the third quarter, up 2.4% from a year earlier, according to real-estate research firm <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market, one of the weakest parts of the economy, had some mildly positive news. Home construction last month increased 15.0% from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 658,000, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with the same month a year earlier, overall new-home construction in September was up 10.2%. Nevertheless, construction remained below a healthy level, which economists say would be a pace of around 1 million to 1.5 million starts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newly issued building permits, a gauge of future construction, fell 5.0% from a month earlier to an annual rate of 594,000, the lowest level in five months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The industry is on pace to sell just over 300,000 homes this year. That would be the lowest level on records dating back to 1963 and worse than the previous low of 323,000 set last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists cautioned that the general trend for the housing market remains poor. "Unfortunately, the underlying trend of single-family housing starts shows no signs of improving in a significant manner anytime soon," wrote Joshua Shapiro, chief economist with MFR Inc.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As demand for top-end rentals remains unusually strong, some developers are taking a page from the condo playbook and renting out units to people sight unseen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Touring a new apartment to assess its views, decor and the ever-elusive vibe has long been a staple of house-hunting in New York City. But Joshua Nydes, a 29-year-old equities trader, put all of that aside in renting an apartment at <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span>'s new Ten23 project on West 23rd Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 111-unit rental building likely won't be completed until January, and it has no sales office or model apartment for prospective renters to check out. But the building, situated directly on the High Line elevated park, has an unusual selling point: passersby on the High Line can peek inside the structure while it is being built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Whether you like it or not, if you're on the High Line park you can actually look into the apartments," Mr. Nydes said, explaining that is what he did one day while strolling. "I really liked what I saw."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without ever being inside the building, Mr. Nydes put down a $1,000 deposit to hold his one-bedroom unit on the eighth floor. He recently went on a hard-hat tour of the unfinished product, and sealed the deal. He's one of five renters that have done so already, according to the developer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Some people thought we were crazy. Some people still think we are," said Tom Lebling, a senior vice president at Equity. But he said the developers wanted to get momentum before the chilly winter months, when fewer people hunt for apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For developers, renting or selling units in an unfinished building usually means fetching a significantly lower price, unless demand is especially frenzied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the condo boom in 2006 and 2007, for example, competition for units in some buildings was so intense that buyers were snapping up units sometimes years in advance based on sparse floor plans rather than risk being shut out by waiting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Very rarely do people rent apartments off of floor plans because, even when demand is strong, the supply of rentals is much more robust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now rents are just below what they were during the peak in 2006, and developers are gambling that renting off of floor plans might work with their unfinished apartment towers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Not all developers have gone that far, but at an 11-unit rental project at 83 Franklin St., the developer also began marketing units before the building was finished. On Tuesday one of the last leases -- for the penthouse -- was signed, according to CORE Group's Doron Zwickel, who is marketing the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're leaving a little bit of money on the table," Mr. Zwickel said. But the developer who waits also takes a risk if the economy turns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Who knows what's going to be then? No one really has a crystal ball," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Haendel St. Juste, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc. who covers <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span>, says developers have to make that difficult risk-reward calculus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It certainly is not the typical approach, but with fears of cutbacks on Wall Street you wonder at what point that starts to impact the market," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only a handful of new rental buildings have hit the market in the last year, but most developers and brokers say the trend is unlikely to spread beyond very high-end buildings with unique locations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The rental customer -- they like to stand in it, like to touch it and see it and feel it. They want to see that their furniture is going to fit and they want to see if that's the view they expected," said Clifford Finn, president of new-development marketing at Citi Habitats. "I'm not sure that people are that willing to take that leap of faith today."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. house prices have plunged by nearly a third since 2006, and homeownership rates are falling at the fastest pace since the Great Depression.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news? Two key measures now suggest it's an excellent time to buy a house, either to live in for the long term or for investment income (but not for a quick flip). First, the nation's ratio of house prices to yearly rents is nearly restored to its prebubble average. Second, when mortgage rates are taken into consideration, houses are the most affordable they have been in decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two of the silliest mantras during the real-estate bubble were that a house is the best investment you will ever make and that a renter "throws money down the drain." Whether buying is a better deal than renting isn't a stagnant fact but a changing condition that depends on the relationship between prices and rents, the cost of financing and other factors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the math is turning in buyers' favor. Stock-oriented folks can think of a house's price/rent ratio as akin to a stock's price/earnings ratio, in that it compares the cost of an asset with the money the asset is capable of generating. For investors, a lower ratio suggests more income for the price. For prospective homeowners, a lower ratio makes owning more attractive than renting, all else equal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, the ratio of home prices to yearly rents is 11.3, down from 18.5 at the peak of the bubble, according to <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics. The average from 1989 to 2003 was about 10, so valuations aren't quite back to normal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for most home buyers, mortgage rates are a key determinant of their total costs. Rates are so low now that houses in many markets look like bargains, even if price/rent ratios aren't hitting new lows. The 30-year mortgage rate rose to 4.12% this week from a record low of 3.94% last week, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> said Thursday. (The rates assume 0.8% in prepaid interest, or "points.") The latest rate is still less than half the average since 1971.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, house payments are more affordable than they have been in decades. The National Association of Realtors Housing Affordability Index hit 183.7 in August, near its record high in data going back to 1970. The index's historic average is roughly 120. A reading of 100 would mean that a median-income family with a 20% down payment can afford a mortgage on a median-price home. So today's buyers can afford handsome houses—but prudent ones might opt for moderate houses with skimpy payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, the median home in the greater Phoenix market, including houses, condos and co-ops, costs $121,700, according to <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span>. With a 20% down payment and a 4.12% mortgage rate, a buyer's monthly payment would be about $470. Rent for a comparable house would be more than $1,100 a month, according to data provided by <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, all of this assumes mortgages are available—no given now that lending standards have tightened. But long-term data on down payments and credit scores suggest conditions are more normal than many buyers think, according to Stan Humphries, chief economist at Zillow. "If you have good credit, a job and a down payment, you can get a mortgage," Mr. Humphries says. "There's more paperwork and scrutiny than five years ago, but things are pretty much like they were in the '80s and '90s."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all housing markets are bargains. Mr. Humphries says Zillow has developed a new price/rent ratio that uses estimates for each individual property rather than city medians, to better reflect the choices facing typical buyers. A fresh look at the numbers suggests Detroit and Miami are plenty cheap for buyers, with price/rent ratios of 5.6 and 7.7, respectively. New York and San Francisco are more expensive, with ratios of 17.6 and 17.2, respectively. The median ratio for 169 markets is 10.7.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For investors seeking income, one back-of-the-envelope way of seeing how these numbers stack up against yields for other assets is to divide 1 by the price/rent ratio, resulting in a rent "yield." The median market's rent yield is 9.3% and Detroit's is 17.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors would then subtract for taxes, insurance, upkeep and other expenses—costs that vary widely. But suppose total costs were 4% of the purchase price. That would still leave a 5.3% rent yield in the typical market. With the 10-year Treasury yield at 2.2% and the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index carrying a dividend yield of 2.1%, rents for residential housing in many markets look attractive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few caveats are in order. First, not all transactions are average ones. Even in low-priced markets, buyers should shop carefully. Second, prices could fall further. Celia Chen, a senior director at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics, expects prices to drop 3% before bottoming early next year and rising slowly thereafter. "If the economy slips back into recession, however, we could easily see a 10% drop," Ms. Chen says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And property "flipping" can be dangerous even when prices are rising. That is because, absent a real-estate boom, house price gains simply aren't that exciting. Research by Yale economist Robert Shiller suggests houses more or less track the rate of inflation over long time periods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houses aren't the magic wealth creators they were made out to be during the bubble. But when prices are low, loans are cheap and plump investment yields are scarce, buyers should jump.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yan Feng, a pediatrician from Beijing, just paid $2.3 million for a townhouse on Convent Avenue in the Hamilton Heights neighborhood in Harlem, bidding $100,000 more than the asking price after losing out on another deal for a house down the street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Ms. Feng and her husband, Stanley Cha, a securities lawyer, have an eye out for other townhouses in the neighborhood as second homes for friends from Beijing, and they are looking for commercial investments in the neighborhood as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their purchase of the 20-foot-wide house with an unusual stepped brick gable is part of a recent renaissance of the Harlem real-estate market that is bringing in new buyers for both century-old townhouses and new condominiums across Harlem following the worst of the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a long chill in the market, there has been a resurgence of the sales of townhouses, with three townhouses closing between $2.3 million and $2.85 million, the highest prices since the spring of 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most expensive single townhouse sale since 2007 -- a meticulously renovated loft-like house on West 122nd Street -- closed on Sept. 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another top sale was the $2.5 million sale of a townhouse at 30 W. 120th St. owned through a limited liability company by basketball great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. It was listed for $3.45 million in April 2010, with the asking price then cut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the third quarter, the number of Harlem apartment sales rose to the highest level since September 2008, according to analysis of city records. But they were only slightly above sales reported in the same quarter in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen Kliegerman, president of Halstead Development Marketing, said that in the last few months, the backlog of unsold new condominiums in Harlem has fallen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate in less-established neighborhoods usually is hurt more than that in prime locations during downturns. But brokers say that new restaurants and stores are getting the attention of new buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is an easier sell and the new commercial development has also opened people's eyes up to see the neighborhood in a different light," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kliegerman said sales were particularly strong a 88 Morningside a 12-story building at West 122nd Street and Morningside Avenue, with a rooftop deck facing Morningside Park. He said the building attracted a mix of buyers, including several from mainland China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales were also strong, he said, at the Gateway Tower on Frederick Douglass Boulevard, he said where 55 condos in a seven-story addition went on the market in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 88 Morningside, larger two- and three-bedroom apartments have now sold out at 88 Morningside and only one-bedroom apartments are left. In all more than 60% of the 73 condos in the building have been sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The brownstone on West 120th Street that set a post-financial-crisis high in Harlem was an easy sale, according to Jane Wilson, a Corcoran broker who handled the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sellers, Ruedi Hofman and his wife, Ann Stratton, were both photographers who lived and worked in a loft building in the Meatpacking district until they were priced out of that area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After renting for a while in Harlem, they bought a 19-foot-wide townhouse on West 122th Street for $1.35 million in 2007. They converted the property from an single-room occupancy hotel to a one family residence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple created a loft-like space, tearing down some interior walls to open up the parlor floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Openness was important and so was light, light is very important to a photographer," said Mr. Hofman, a fashion and commercial photographer who worked with Richard Avedon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Convent Avenue, Rhahime Bell, a son of Aaron Bell, the jazz bass player who worked with Duke Ellington, paid $775,000 for the house in 2001, as the neighborhood was undergoing a wave of gentrification.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He restored the house and in 2006 during the housing boom, put it on the market for a while at $4.35 million. In June he listed it with Brian Phillips, a broker with Prudential Douglas Elliman, for only $2.2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Feng and her husband were in the market for a second home, looking at new glass condo towers in Manhattan. Both went to school in the U.S. and hold dual Chinese and American citizenship, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They were about to sign a contract for the purchase of a condominium at the Aldyn, a new condominium on Riverside Boulevard on the Upper West Side, when Ms. Feng asked her broker, Jing Chen of Corcoran. where she lived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They soon visited Ms. Feng at her home in Hamilton Heights. "I said, 'Jing, can you find us a house like that,'" Ms. Feng said. They lost the first house and decided to "bid high" on the second one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Phillips said that each of his four listings in Central Harlem and Hamilton Heights have sold in the last few months or have deals in place.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto   </div><div>483 words</div><div>11 October 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A22</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales in Brooklyn remained strong during the third quarter, despite recent economic turmoil that some feared would cause developers to slash prices and buyers to flee to more established Manhattan neighborhoods as they did during more severe turbulence in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brooklyn saw the largest dollar increase in home prices of the five boroughs in the third quarter compared with the year-earlier period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average price home-sale price per square foot in Brooklyn was $443, up from $421 in the same quarter last year, according to the Real Estate Board of New York's third-quarter report, to be released Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The borough remains deeply divided in terms of volume trends, however, as the strong neighborhoods, such as Williamsburg and Park Slope, grew stronger while less-desirable ones have yet to fully emerge from the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The exception was Bedford-Stuyvesant, which moved to third-place in the borough in terms of sales volume.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report by REBNY, a trade association, found Williamsburg's market remained hot, with 216 condo sales the third quarter, a 14% increase from the same quarter of 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers have remained active in Brooklyn, in part, because a scarcity of supply makes them loath to wait and miss out, said Deborah Rieders, a Corcoran broker handling 144 N. Eighth St. and others in Williamsburg, Bedford-Stuyvesant and Park Slope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In Williamsburg and brownstone Brooklyn, people know if they wait, they're going to lose out," she said. "There are a lot more one-of-the-kind apartments."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, the city's housing market continued to show slight improvement over summer, according to REBNY. The average price per square foot for an apartment in New York City increased to $568 in the third quarter from $528 in the year-earlier period. Volume also increased slightly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REBNY's data reflect a slight lag compared with some of the other brokerages' reports because it relies on deeds filed with city records, while some reports also include closed sales reported by brokers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Queens and the Bronx prices remained stable, at $308 a square foot and $223 a square foot, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On many counts, Staten Island continued to lag the other four boroughs, in part because the market is dominated by single-family homes, for which values remain depressed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in the strongest neighborhoods, a few signs of a possible slowdown emerged. In Williamsburg, for example, sales volume decreased 9% in the third quarter compared with the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the massive waterfront project called the Edge, Jeff Levine, a principal of Douglaston Development, said he saw a drop in condo sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We went from an average of 30 units to an average in the summer of just over 20 units a month, which in this world is still pretty fantastic," Mr. Levine said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two giant real-estate firms are about to ratchet up their competition on Manhattan's emerging far West Side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2008, the Related Cos. and <span class="companylink">Brookfield Office Properties Inc</span>. have been vying to be the dominant developer in the area. Both control sprawling properties in the blocks west of Pennsylvania Station but, until now, neither has been willing to start work given an uncertain economic outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the two firms say they plan to start initial construction on their sites early next year, which would be a landmark event for the neighborhood west of southern Midtown that has for decades been targeted by planners for large-scale development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Related may also be on the verge of a major leasing announcement. The developer is in advanced discussions with handbag maker <span class="companylink">Coach Inc</span>. to take about one-third of the space in its planned 1.8 million-square-foot office tower at the West Side rail yards by 30th Street and 10th Avenue, according to people familiar with the talks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coach would be the first tenant to commit to building in the area. A spokeswoman for Coach declined to comment on the negotiations, as did Jay Cross, who heads West Side development for Related.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Related agreed in 2008 to a $1 billion deal with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to develop the massive West Side rail yards a 26-acre storage area for <span class="companylink">Long Island Rail Road</span> trains bounded by 10th Avenue, 12th Avenue, 30th Street and 33rd Street. Related has privately been telling real-estate executives and government officials that it plans to begin work on the first office tower early next year, with a major boost from an agreement with Coach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brookfield, one of the city's largest office landlords, has been in the neighborhood longer. For decades, it has pondered what to do with its large site along Ninth Avenue between 31st and 33rd Streets. Its current plans call for three to four towers on the site, and it says it intends to start construction on a necessary $300 million deck over a set of rail tracks under the site in the first quarter of 2011. The firm says it could deliver its first building in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In January, we're starting the deck," said Ric Clark, Brookfield's chief executive, who added much of the initial work would begin offsite, assembling materials for the platform.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate developers, of course, are known for their optimism and actual construction of office towers aren't a sure thing until steel starts rising. Even with a Coach deal, it's unclear whether Related could get the financing to move forward, given that there would still be about 1.2 million square feet left to be filled. In recent days, the firm tapped brokerage <span class="companylink">CBRE Group Inc</span>. to market the tower to potential tenants, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, Brookfield and Related are moving forward at a time when the city's economy is only gradually recovering from the economic downturn -- let alone mounting concerns over another recession. In healthier times, the two projects would complement each other by helping the area reach a critical mass of office development. But today the two could find themselves in stiff competition for employers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are a number of companies with big leases due in coming years -- from <span class="companylink">Time Warner Inc</span>. to <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse Group</span>. But only so many will likely be willing to take a leap to an emerging neighborhood that has been compared to London's relatively young Canary Wharf district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Related, led by Stephen Ross, is the developer of the <span class="companylink">Time Warner</span> Center. The entertainment and media firm is considering moving its headquarters to the rail yards. Related's first tower could be built on solid ground, but future buildings would require a deck costing more than $700 million to be built over each of the two rail yards, where Related also plans open public space and retail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What distinguishes us is that our state of the art office environment is going to be part of a larger mixed use project with more amenities," says Related's Mr. Cross.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Related's project has been a priority of the Bloomberg administration's and the city is paying to extend the No. 7 line to 33rd Street and 11th Avenue, currently scheduled to be done in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both firms play down any rivalry, but acknowledge that there are only so many companies interested in moving, and many will likely look at both sites. "We will have competition for tenants, there's no question," says Mr. Clark, of Brookfield. "I'm happy we own our site -- I like its proximity to transit."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firms are also competing to amass more space on the West Side. This spring, Brookfield bought a majority stake in 450 W. 33rd St., the building on 10th Avenue that lies between Related's development site and its own. Related also considered buying the building, a person familiar with the matter said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three years after virtually nationalizing the U.S. mortgage market, the government has embarked on a pullback to see whether private industry picks up the slack.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some people in the housing industry worry that Washington's move will cause fresh pain in many regions where demand has yet to recover amid the sluggish economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At issue are the loan limits that Congress expanded in 2008, allowing <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> to buy mortgages that exceeded the national cap of $417,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the mortgage market melted down four years ago and sent private mortgage companies fleeing, interest rates rose sharply on "jumbo" mortgages -- those too large for backing by Fannie, Freddie or agencies such as the Federal Housing Administration. That accelerated home-price declines in high-end markets throughout California and the Northeast, where many pricey homes couldn't be bought with a government-backed loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To stem the fallout in prices, Congress raised the loan caps to as high as $729,750 in markets such as Los Angeles and New York. It then passed a series of one-year extensions to keep the higher limits in place. But this year, Congress and the Obama administration opted against an extension.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, the limits in hundreds of counties fell by 10% or more on Oct. 1. For loans backed by Fannie and Freddie, the limits declined to between $417,000 and $625,500 in about 200 counties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More worrisome to real-estate agents are declines in the FHA limits, which fell to between $271,050 and $625,500 in 600 counties. Those changes are causing heartburn because the FHA allows buyers to make down payments of just 3.5%, and it has financed as many as half of all home purchases in recent quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Policy makers allowed the limits to fall because they want private companies to hold more mortgage risk, and dialing down loan limits is one way to carve out space for those investors. Fannie, Freddie, and the FHA currently back nine in 10 new mortgages. Taxpayers already are on the hook for $141 billion in losses at Fannie and Freddie, and the FHA's reserves have plunged to razor-thin levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgages that don't qualify for government backing typically have higher borrowing costs, including interest rates around 0.75 percentage point above conforming loans. Mortgage rates currently are very low, but jumbo loans also require bigger down payments -- at least 20% -- and can have tougher qualification rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The net-net here is that the available pool of credit for housing is shrinking. Prices will have to decline," said Christopher Whalen, co-founder of risk-management consultant Institutional Risk Analytics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On one side of the debate are mortgage investors who say the government needs to give the private sector more room to compete if a vibrant market for nongovernment-backed loans is to re-emerge. "The banking industry, flush with excess deposits, will fund those loans," said Mike McMahon of Redwood Trust, a real-estate investment firm in Mill Valley, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Assuming a 20% down payment, the new limits still allow homeowners in California to qualify for a government-backed mortgage on a $780,000 home. Critics say there's little public policy rationale to subsidize loans for those borrowers, who need substantial incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other side are real-estate agents and some economists who say sellers are in for a nasty surprise when they find that fewer potential buyers qualify to purchase their properties. They say the changes also could hamstring "trade-up" buyers who typically used home equity, which has plunged during the bust, as their down payment to move to a bigger residence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gisella Olivares closed on a home in Upland, Calif., on the day before the new loan limits went into effect. Without the FHA-backed mortgage, "there would be no way I could afford to get the house," said Dr. Olivares, who qualified for a $448,000 mortgage. In California's Inland Empire region, the metropolitan area an hour east of Los Angeles, the FHA loan limit fell to $335,000 from $500,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Dr. Olivares, a 42-year-old physician, had to make the $100,000 down payment for a jumbo mortgage, she said she would have waited at least two years to buy a home. The seller, meanwhile, was able to avoid foreclosure by completing a short sale, where the bank allowed the house to sell for less than the amount owed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loan limits wouldn't appear to have much of an impact on the overall housing market. In 2009, about 1.5% of home-purchase loans backed by government entities wouldn't have been eligible under the new limits, according to a study by the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the same study emphasized the outsize local impact. Some 9% of purchases would have been affected in San Jose, Calif., and 5% in San Diego.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, banks would have to increase the number of jumbo loan originations by 56% to make up the gap, "which the private sector could be hard pressed to fill," said Mark Willis, one of the study's authors. "If you want to get the market moving, why would you decrease the availability of credit for any part of it?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, the loan-limit issue shows the broader challenge in bringing back private capital and reducing taxpayer exposure: Housing markets are shaky, and the government is still offering better terms than private lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steps that raise borrowing costs could attract private investors, but if that pushes home prices down in the process, it may do more harm to the economy and to individual housing markets still reeling from the real estate bust.</p>

It then passed a series of one-year extensions to keep the higher limits in place. But this year, Congress and the Obama administration opted against an extension.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, the limits in hundreds of counties fell by 10% or more on Oct. 1. For loans backed by Fannie and Freddie, the limits declined to between $417,000 and $625,500 in about 200 counties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More worrisome to real-estate agents are declines in the FHA limits, which fell to between $271,050 and $625,500 in 600 counties. Those changes are causing heartburn because the FHA allows buyers to make down payments of just 3.5%, and it has financed as many as half of all home purchases in recent quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Policy makers allowed the limits to fall because they want private companies to hold more mortgage risk, and dialing down loan limits is one way to carve out space for those investors. Fannie, Freddie, and the FHA currently back nine in 10 new mortgages. Taxpayers already are on the hook for $141 billion in losses at Fannie and Freddie, and the FHA's reserves have plunged to razor-thin levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgages that don't qualify for government backing typically have higher borrowing costs, including interest rates around 0.75 percentage point above conforming loans. Mortgage rates currently are very low, but jumbo loans also require bigger down payments—at least 20%—and can have tougher qualification rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The net-net here is that the available pool of credit for housing is shrinking. Prices will have to decline," said Christopher Whalen, co-founder of risk-management consultant Institutional Risk Analytics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On one side of the debate are mortgage investors who say the government needs to give the private sector more room to compete if a vibrant market for nongovernment-backed loans is to re-emerge. "The banking industry, flush with excess deposits, will fund those loans," said Mike McMahon of Redwood Trust, a real-estate investment firm in Mill Valley, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Assuming a 20% down payment, the new limits still allow homeowners in parts of California to qualify for a government-backed mortgage on a $780,000 home. Critics say there's little public policy rationale to subsidize loans for those borrowers, who need substantial incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other side are real-estate agents and some economists who say sellers are in for a nasty surprise when they find that fewer potential buyers qualify to purchase their properties. They say the changes also could hamstring "trade-up" buyers who typically used home equity, which has plunged during the bust, as their down payment to move to a bigger residence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gisella Olivares closed on a home in Upland, Calif., on the day before the new loan limits went into effect. Without the FHA-backed mortgage, "there would be no way I could afford to get the house," said Dr. Olivares, who qualified for a $448,000 mortgage. In California's Inland Empire region, the metropolitan area an hour east of Los Angeles, the FHA loan limit fell to $355,350 from $500,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Dr. Olivares, a 42-year-old physician, had to make the $100,000 down payment for a jumbo mortgage, she said she would have waited at least two years to buy a home. The seller, meanwhile, was able to avoid foreclosure by completing a short sale, where the bank allowed the house to sell for less than the amount owed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loan limits wouldn't appear to have much of an impact on the overall housing market. In 2009, about 1.5% of home-purchase loans backed by government entities wouldn't have been eligible under the new limits, according to a study by the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the same study emphasized the outsize local impact. Some 9% of purchases would have been affected in San Jose, Calif., and 5% in San Diego.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, banks would have to increase the number of jumbo loan originations by 56% to make up the gap, "which the private sector could be hard pressed to fill," said Mark Willis, one of the study's authors. "If you want to get the market moving, why would you decrease the availability of credit for any part of it?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, the loan-limit issue shows the broader challenge in bringing back private capital and reducing taxpayer exposure: Housing markets are shaky, and the government is still offering better terms than private lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steps that raise borrowing costs could attract private investors, but if that pushes home prices down in the process, it may do more harm to the economy and to individual housing markets still reeling from the real estate bust.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Amy Hoak   </div><div>939 words</div><div>9 October 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some home sellers, it was a long summer without a home sale. That means this fall, some buyers -- smelling the desperation -- may be able to cut a better deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Sellers who had their homes on the market all summer are anxious to move on, especially before the holidays hit," says Bill Golden, a real-estate agent with ReMax in Atlanta. The closer it gets to the holidays, the more anxious unsuccessful sellers can become, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other sellers will choose to let their listings expire and try again next year. They, too, may be willing to make a deal in order to sell their properties, even if they're no longer actively trying to sell their place, says Patrick Carlisle, chief market analyst for Paragon Real Estate Group in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key to making an aggressive "lowball" offer on a home is to start by finding properties that have languished on the market for a long time. The softer the market, the more likely the strategy will work, Mr. Carlisle says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But buyers can get tripped up. Here are six things you need to do when making a lowball offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. Understand the market</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before submitting an offer, your real-estate agent should do a full comparative market analysis of the property to determine what its fair market value is, Mr. Carlisle says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, it's still a buyer's market in the Richmond, Va., area, where Susan Stynes works as a real-estate agent for <span class="companylink">Long &amp; Foster</span>. Ms. Stynes says she wouldn't hesitate to encourage a client to make an aggressive offer, after considering the time the property has been on the market and neighborhood comparables.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in other markets a low offer won't get you far, says Stephen G. Kliegerman, president of Halstead Property Development Marketing in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. Pick the right real-estate agent</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some real-estate agents caution buyers against making an offer that is so low it could offend the seller and halt the negotiation process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But sometimes agents are too reluctant to make aggressive offers, Mr. Carlisle says. They may be more focused on completing a deal and collecting their commission, rather than making the best deal. Or their negotiation skills might not be up to par.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If it's an appealing, well-priced property that has five or six offers on it, well, going in 10% or 20% under asking isn't going to get you anywhere," he says. But on a property that has been overlooked by the market and doesn't have multiple bidders, it often doesn't hurt to go in low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. Back up your price</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's an art to presenting an offer that's substantially under the asking price. A low offer could start negotiations off on the wrong foot if you're not careful, Mr. Golden says. The key is for you or your agent to explain the offer when presented.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Sellers want to know why you're coming in so low. Include recent [comparable sales in the area] or issues with the property that validate why your offer is so low," he says. Don't be too harsh with your criticism, however -- that can also work against you, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4. Know what you're willing to pay</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers these days have a strong motivation to get the best possible price on a property, especially if they believe that home values will fall even more, says Jay Butler, professor emeritus of real estate at the W. P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University. Their biggest worry is often that people will say they overpaid, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But sellers have limits, too, most often dictated by the amount of home equity they have, Mr. Butler says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before negotiations begin, it's important for a buyer to decide what his walk-away price is, Mr. Carlisle says. "At some price point, the deal is no longer worth doing, no matter how great the property."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a buyer should know how high she is willing to go, don't put limits in the first offer, Mr. Kliegerman says. You lose integrity if you say it's your "best and final" offer, but then are willing to come up with a few thousand dollars more in order to buy the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5. Make a clean, easy offer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When you make a low bid, you want other elements of the offer to be attractive to the seller. And a deal that can close quickly often will have appeal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Make sure there are as few contingencies as possible, Mr. Golden says. It's best if buyers don't have a home to sell in order to buy the one they're bidding on, Ms. Stynes says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, have your financials in order from the start. Loan qualification is more difficult these days, so it's important to have a lender pre-approval letter, Mr. Carlisle says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">6. Be smart about a cash deal</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash is king, but in the end, a seller often wants the most money for his home -- regardless of if the buyer needs a mortgage or not. So don't think making an all-cash bid will automatically mean an accepted offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the seller is a bank because the property is a foreclosure, the institution may accept a lower offer from a cash buyer, as opposed to someone who needs a mortgage, Mr. Golden says. Banks often don't want to deal with mortgage-related delays.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Andrew Bary   </div><div>486 words</div><div>9 October 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lowe's</span>, with its larger rival, <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>, dominates the home-improvement retailing sector, but that hasn't insulated it from a weak housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> (LOW) shares, at around $20, are down more than 40% from their 2007 peak and trade about where they did a decade ago. The company operates more than 1,750 stores in North America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bullish analysts and investors argue that the stock looks appealing because <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> could benefit from any housing upturn and its new merchandising strategy -- keyed to everyday low prices, rather than frequent promotions -- might let it take market share from <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>. <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> also has pruned its management ranks, tried to improve customer service and sought to make its stores more inviting, with better displays and product groupings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"<span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> and <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> have a nice duopoly," says Gary Balter, a retailing analyst at <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> who has an "outperform" rating on <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span>, with a one-year price target of $30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both retailers use the Internet to drive sales by letting customers order online and then pick up merchandise in stores. Pure online retailers aren't much of a threat because bulky items like bags of cement, salt and mulch, plus seasonal items like potted plants and flowers, aren't shipped easily or cheaply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> trades for almost 13 times projected 2011 profits of $1.59 a share and 11 times estimated 2012 earnings of $1.78 a share. The stock carries a 2.8% dividend yield and the company has been aggressively buying back stock. It repurchased 8% of its shares outstanding in the first half.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The negatives on <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> are that it still faces a shaky economy and a weak housing market, and that it has a formidable rival in <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>, which has turned in a better sales performance this year than <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> has. But <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> brass believe their new merchandising initiatives can close the gap with their big competitor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The downside in the stock seems limited because of <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> strong market position and a book value -- shareholder equity -- of $13 per share. (Shareholder equity is assets minus debt and other liabilities.) Most of the company's assets are stores; it owns almost 90% of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Balter says it's tough to identify a "catalyst" that will boost <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> stock anytime soon, given the economy. Most homeowners now are limiting spending to repairs and maintenance, and aren't undertaking major projects like kitchen and bathroom renovations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, ultimately, many deferred projects will be completed as the economy improves and Americans start spending more freely on their homes. This should benefit <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span>. After all, home improvement is one of the great American pastimes.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Chana R. Schoenberger </div><div>891 words</div><div>8 October 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadians are on a Sun Belt shopping spree.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix and other warm-weather cities that have seen real-estate prices crater are newly popular among Canadians looking for second homes or investment properties, brokers and buyers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are lured by the weak U.S. dollar, historically low interest rates and rock-bottom property prices, dragged down by high unemployment and a wave of foreclosures. For the two years that ended in March, Canadians made up the largest percentage of foreigners buying homes in the U.S. -- 23% -- up from 11% in 2007, according to the National Association of Realtors. Arizona and Florida are the focus of their interest, according to the Realtors' group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Germain Villeneuve has $50 million to spend on Phoenix real estate, all from Canadian investors like himself. The former real-estate broker, 50 years old, moved to Phoenix from Montreal in January to oversee acquisitions for the Living Well Homes investment fund. Since October, he has bought 110 houses and two apartment buildings in the Phoenix area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Living Well plans to fix up the properties and rent them to locals who have lost their homes to foreclosures and short sales -- transactions in which the property sells for less than the mortgage. Then, five to seven years from now, the fund hopes to sell the homes for a profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We know that when [the economy] recovers, the homes will appreciate in value, and the U.S. dollar will get stronger, so when it comes time to move our money back into Canadian dollars we'll make more money," said Mr. Villeneuve, calling from a three-bedroom, two-bath house he hoped to snap up at auction for $113,000 -- less than half its last sale price. It ended up going to another buyer for $120,100.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such investments aren't without risks. Continued economic weakness and high unemployment could keep battered housing prices from improving for an extended period. And the strong Canadian dollar, which has bolstered Canadians' buying power in the U.S., could come back to haunt them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian dollar began flirting with parity against the U.S. dollar -- meaning one loonie could be exchanged for one greenback -- in 2007. It dropped as low as 94 Canadian cents for each U.S. dollar, for the first time in three decades. The U.S. dollar gained strength during the 2008 financial crisis, then lost steam again. In the past few weeks, a burst of fear that the world economy is on the brink of another recession has led the greenback slightly upward, with one U.S. dollar now buying 1.03 Canadian dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Over the medium to long term, we continue to believe that the U.S. dollar will weaken materially from current levels, leaving Canadians who invest in U.S. real estate exposed to potential foreign-exchange losses," said Camilla Sutton, chief currency strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite such risks, maple-leaf flags are popping up around Phoenix. At the Ice House Tavern, a sports bar, Molson Canadian is now the No. 2-selling beer on tap, after Miller Lite. The bar's third annual Canada Day celebration July 1 attracted 70 people, after beginning in 2009 as a potluck for 15. "It kind of started as a joke and now it's gotten pretty serious," said owner Daryl Chester.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wayne McIntosh, who owns the Half Moon Drive-In diner just north of Winnipeg, Manitoba, closed in June on a $260,000 vacation condo in Desert Ridge, in a new gated development that will be ready in February. He plans to take his wife and two children there at least five weeks a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's purchasing power, plain and simple," said Mr. McIntosh, 48, of the strong Canadian dollar. "In the days when our dollar was 60 or 65 cents, I wouldn't even be talking to you. The strong Canadian dollar has created a lot of opportunities for Canadians."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers are paying cash or taking out mortgages with U.S. banks, said broker Michael Milic of Colliers International in Scottsdale, a Canadian with 15 years' residency in the area,</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport, flights from Bellingham, Wash., and Grand Forks, N.D., bring in Canadians who drive over the border for cheaper tickets, as low as about $250 round trip. Real-estate companies have discussed buying ads in the terminal targeting Canadians who want to buy property, said airport spokesman Brian Sexton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sexton represents the other side of the Phoenix real-estate trade. He bought his two-bedroom condo in 2007 for $180,000. With a growing family, including a new baby, he would like to move into a bigger place. But selling his condo is a challenge, even with similar units selling for $60,000, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sexton said his condo complex is rife with rumors a Canadian investor recently bought up a handful of units from short-sellers, with plans to rent them out. He is considering chasing down the buyer to see if there is any interest in his own unit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Americans always seemed to have more money than Canadians," he said. "What happened?"</p>

</div><div class="author">By Eric Morath                And Katy Stech   </div><div>593 words</div><div>7 October 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A real-estate fund run by <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>. has walked away from a $1.26 billion deal with <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc</span>. to buy a portfolio of 10 office buildings in a suburb of Washington, according to a lawsuit filed Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lehman is seeking $100 million in damages from the Goldman-run U.S. Real Estate Opportunities fund, alleging the fund's "unjustified" termination of the deal just two days before the sale was to close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real-estate private-equity fund's "unilateral and groundless termination of the agreement was wrongful" since it violated Lehman's contractual right to extend the deal's deadline, lawyers for the failed investment bank said in papers filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> spokesman declined to comment on the suit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The collapse of the deal for the office buildings in Rosslyn, Va., comes just months after the pact was heralded as part of Lehman's successful strategy to wait for the real-estate market to rebound before liquidating some of the $13.2 billion of real-estate assets still on its books at the start of 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price on the now-scuttled deal nearly matched the $1.29 billion that a venture led by Lehman paid for the properties at the market's peak in 2007. In July, Jeff Fitts, a managing director at Lehman's estate manager <span class="companylink">Alvarez &amp; Marsal</span>, told The Wall Street Journal that the sale was "another example" of executing the strategy to take advantage of the improving real-estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Lehman spokeswoman declined to comment Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the lawsuit, the Goldman-led fund terminated the deal Tuesday because Lehman had allegedly failed to satisfy certain conditions of the purchase agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lehman called the Goldman-led fund's move "entirely pretextual and a blatant attempt to avoid its contractual obligations."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lehman said in the suit that if conditions weren't met, the purchase agreement guaranteed the seller's right to extend the closing deadline for 15 days in order to satisfy any problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposed sale, in which Lehman was looking to sell its 78.5% equity stake in office-building partnership, was part of the bank's efforts to monetize its real-estate assets and raise funds to repay creditors. Lehman, which filed for Chapter 11 in 2008, is set to seek court approval for its liquidation plan later this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lehman's sale of its extensive property portfolio and other activities to wind down its estate, however, may continue for several more years as the deal's collapse comes as the commercial real-estate market has cooled in recent months, ending two years of consistently rising values as investors become skittish about the direction of the economy. A Green Street Advisors index that tracks commercial-property values, released Thursday, found that values have been flat for five straight months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sellers of property are receiving less interest than a few months earlier, and some deals have collapsed, including <span class="companylink">Cerberus Capital Management LP</span>'s $1.12 billion purchase of <span class="companylink">Innkeepers USA Trust</span> hotels. Cerberus walked away from the deal in August, and in court papers filed this week cited "abrupt, substantial deterioration in the economy" as rationale.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rate of home ownership in the U.S. fell in the last decade by the largest amount since the Great Depression, although the percentage of Americans who own their home remains the second-highest on record, the Census Bureau said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The release coincided with another milestone in the housing sector: Interest rates on 30-year fixed loans fell to 3.94%, falling below 4% for the first time, according to a <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as long as home prices continue to fall and labor markets remain weak, economists say the low rates won't be enough to lure buyers and spur a rebound in the housing market anytime soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People's perceptions of likely future home prices have been altered in a negative fashion," said Thomas Lawler, an independent housing economist in Leesburg, Va. "People buy a home not just to live in but because it's an investment. Combine that with a lousy economy and it becomes a lot harder in today's world to qualify for a mortgage to buy a home than to qualify to rent one for the next year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between 2000 and 2010, the ownership rate, defined as the percentage of owner-occupied housing units to all occupied housing units, declined by 1.1 percentage points to 65.1%, with declines in every region. While the rate remains at the second-highest level since data collection began in 1890, it is expected to continue falling as more Americans choose to rent homes instead of own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ownership has lost its appeal for people like Dianne and Charlie Caswell, who once owned a four-bedroom home in Milan, Mich. After their daughter graduated from high school, they wanted to downsize and put the house on the market, where it languished for three years. Finally, facing ballooning payments on their first and second mortgages, the Caswells went into foreclosure and filed for bankruptcy. Now they are renting a three-bedroom home in nearby Saline, and say they are in no hurry to buy because they wouldn't qualify for a mortgage and because they don't know where or how they will pay for retirement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've been renting because it's affordable," said Ms. Caswell, a 52-year-old executive assistant at an ambulance company. "We're like the rest of the country, living paycheck to paycheck. The majority of the time, we just feel like we are playing catch-up."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the Census report doesn't indicate that the American Dream has vanished: West Virginia, Minnesota and Michigan had home-ownership rates above 70%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owners outnumbered renters in all but 1.5% of the nation's 3,143 counties and equivalent areas. By county, the highest home-ownership rates were in Keweenaw County, Mich., and Sumter County, Fla., at 89.8% and 89.7% respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, fewer residents of major cities, where prices tend to be higher, own their homes.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of people renting—not just in cities—is expected to increase as the housing slump gets worse.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rate of home ownership in the U.S. fell in the past decade by the largest amount since the Great Depression, although the percentage of Americans who own their home remains the second-highest on record, the Census Bureau said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The release coincided with another milestone in the housing sector: Interest rates on 30-year fixed loans fell to 3.94%, falling below 4% for the first time, according to a <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as long as home prices continue to fall and labor markets remain weak, economists say the low rates won't be enough to lure buyers and spur a rebound in the housing market anytime soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People's perceptions of likely future home prices have been altered in a negative fashion," said Thomas Lawler, an independent housing economist in Leesburg, Va. "People buy a home not just to live in but because it's an investment. Combine that with a lousy economy and it becomes a lot harder in today's world to qualify for a mortgage to buy a home than to qualify to rent one for the next year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between 2000 and 2010, the ownership rate, defined as the percentage of owner-occupied housing units to all occupied housing units, declined by 1.1 percentage points to 65.1%, with declines in every region. While the rate remains at the second-highest level since data collection began in 1890, it is expected to continue falling as more Americans choose to rent homes instead of own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ownership has lost its appeal for people like Dianne and Charlie Caswell, who once owned a four-bedroom home in Milan, Mich. After their daughter graduated from high school, they wanted to downsize and put the house on the market, where it languished for three years. Finally, facing ballooning payments on their first and second mortgages, the Caswells went into foreclosure and filed for bankruptcy. Now they are renting a three-bedroom home in nearby Saline, and they say they are in no hurry to buy because they wouldn't qualify for a mortgage and because they don't know where or how they will pay for retirement.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Ben Casselman   </div><div>977 words</div><div>4 October 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A14</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturing was the engine that powered the global economy out of the recession. Now that engine is grinding its gears.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From Taiwan to Germany, the world-wide manufacturing sector showed signs of slowing in September, new data showed Monday. Even in China, the red-hot growth that helped sustain the global recovery has begun to cool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, manufacturing is still growing in many countries, including the U.S., where a survey of purchasing managers showed manufacturing output accelerating in September. The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index rose to 51.6 in September from 50.6 in August; readings above 50 on the 100-point scale indicate growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the purchasing managers' report showed new orders contracting, a sign manufacturers are working off a backlog from earlier in the year rather than attracting new business. And a global manufacturing index compiled by <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> fell to its lowest level since June 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A global manufacturing slowdown would have profound implications for the U.S.'s fragile recovery. Overseas profits have boosted the bottom line at U.S. manufacturers even as domestic sales have stalled. Now, that growth could be in question.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Manufacturing's been the star player in the recovery, but it's starting to show signs that it may be going on the disabled list," said Jonathan Basile, an economist with <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend crosses continents and international boundaries. Germany's manufacturing sector showed its weakest growth in two years in September. Growth in Russia remained stagnant in September after contracting in August. Manufacturing sectors in Brazil and Taiwan, already shrinking, fell further into recessionary territory in September. Japan's factories, which boomed after March's earthquake, saw production decline for the first time since April. South Korea's manufacturing activity contracted at its sharpest pace in 11 months in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LG Hausys America, an Atlanta-based maker of acrylic sheets for countertops and other uses, has kept its factory busy on a backlog of orders from earlier in the year, marketing director Jim Rogers said. But the company, a unit of Korean industrial conglomerate <span class="companylink">LG Corp</span>., hasn't seen its usual September bump in new orders as homeowners wrap up renovations before the holidays. "Right after Labor Day we saw a significant drop in volume, which is not typical," Mr. Rogers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The global manufacturing picture remains uneven. <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span>'s index edged down 0.3 points to 49.9 in September. Like the U.S. index, the global index was driven down by a drop in new orders, a sign of worsening activity in the months to come. Manufacturing activity improved in just seven of the 22 countries where September data were available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's just a picture of companies facing very weak demand growth, they've slowed output growth down to rein in inventories," said David Hensley, a <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> economist. "I would figure September, October, November production data are going to look very weak."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The picture was grim in Europe, where an index of manufacturing activity in the 17-country Euro zone hit its lowest level in over two years. The index, compiled by research firm Markit Economics, showed activity slowing in every country except Germany. New orders dropped at their fastest rate in 27 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economic weakness in Europe and the U.S. is hurting Asian manufacturers, which rely on demand from Western consumers. Taiwan's manufacturing index fell in September to its lowest level since January 2009, Markit said. And Markit said Chinese manufacturing contracted slightly, although another index showed marginal growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You've got this dramatic slowing in global demand for manufactured goods in two key markets in the U.S. and Europe," said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist for consulting firm IHS. "So much manufacturing in places like China is geared toward U.S. and European markets."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most data indicate the U.S. economy continues to grow, albeit very slowly. Automobile sales rose in September, driven by a rise in truck and SUV sales, the latest sign that consumers have continued spending despite bleak economic news. Separate data released Monday showed construction spending rose unexpectedly in August, gaining 1.4% due mostly to state and local government projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The manufacturing data also showed areas of strength. The overall manufacturing index rose more than economists had expected, and the Institute of Supply Management report showed growth in 12 of the 18 sectors surveyed. Manufacturers said they were adding jobs heading into Friday's release of September unemployment data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many economists said the data masked an underlying weakness in the manufacturing sector. New orders -- a key sign of what factories will produce in coming months -- held steady at 49.6, below the level that indicates growth. Manufacturers' backlog of orders shrank, while customers' inventories rose, signs that customers aren't placing new orders as old ones are filled. "New orders are really the thing that moves this whole sector," said Brad Holcomb, chairman of the committee that conducts the survey. "Production is high and it's returning to growth . . . but it's being used to work off a backlog of orders, which is contracting."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even companies that are doing well are seeing caution among customers. Overton Industries Inc., a Mooresville, Ind., maker of tooling and dies, expects 2011 sales to be up 5% to 7% from the $12 million recorded last year, said Ron Overton, the company's president. Most of Mr. Overton's customers -- largely in the auto and defense sectors -- say they need his products now, but many are less certain about the months ahead.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising commercial real estate sales this year in New York have led to an unexpected swell in tax revenues, providing a rare source of fiscal relief for governments strained by the slow economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city, state and Metropolitan Transportation Authority have seen tax revenue tied to sales and new mortgages for commercial property and homes jump by hundreds of millions of dollars over the past 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, the MTA took in $465 million from transfer and mortgage taxes in the first nine months of the year, a 58% increase over the same period in 2010, according to data from the authority. Still, the increase is well below the peak levels. In the same period in 2007, the agency took in $1.3 billion from the taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the taxes apply to both residential and commercial property, the lion's share of the revenue comes from commercial deals. They also apply to foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taxes related to real-estate deals are among the more volatile revenue streams for state and local governments, ebbing and flowing with the market's strength. In the first six months of 2011, total commercial property sales hit more than $13.1 billion, compared with $5.2 billion in the first half of 2010, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether or not the increase will continue is an open question. The commercial real estate market nationally has cooled recently, as some lenders have become less willing to make loans and worries about the economy have grown. Still the market for Manhattan trophy property is being aided by historically low interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2007, when the real-estate market was booming and megasales of office buildings became ordinary, the taxes delivered more than $4 billion into public coffers. They surged so much that state officials backed off a proposed fare increase for the MTA in 2007, citing, in part, a rise in transfer taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when the market turned, sales of property plummeted, as did the accompanying transfer taxes, and they stayed at historically low levels for much of 2009 and 2010. That's changed for most of 2011. The commercial property market gathered strength until the economic outlook clouded in the summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With investors betting on Manhattan real estate, prices rebounded faster than many expected, causing owners to put properties on the sales block.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The MTA relies on real estate-related taxes more than any other government body, although it swings depending on the market. About 15% of the agency's revenue in 2007 came from the taxes, while it fell to about 4% of the MTA's nearly $12 billion in revenue in 2010. The MTA relies on these taxes more than the state and the city, which typically take in more than $2 billion a year from the taxes together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, any increase is hardly enough to lift the MTA out of its dire fiscal straits. Earlier this year, it announced it had a $9 billion gap in its budget for capital projects, a hole it planned to fill in large part by borrowing.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LEHIGH ACRES, Fla. -- Joseph Reilly lost his vacation home here last year when he was out of work and stopped paying his mortgage. The bank took the house and sold it. Mr. Reilly thought that was the end of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, he learned otherwise. A phone call informed him of a court judgment against him for $192,576.71.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It turned out that at a foreclosure sale, his former house fetched less than a quarter of what Mr. Reilly owed on it. His bank sued him for the rest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result was a foreclosure hangover that homeowners rarely anticipate but increasingly face: a "deficiency judgment."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forty-one states and the District of Columbia permit lenders to sue borrowers for mortgage debt still left after a foreclosure sale. The economics of today's battered housing market mean that lenders are doing so more and more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosed homes seldom fetch enough to cover the outstanding loan amount, both because buyers financed so much of the purchase price -- up to 100% of it during the housing boom -- and because today's foreclosures take place following a four-year decline in values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Now there are foreclosures that leave banks holding the bag on more than $100,000 in debt," says Michael Cramer, president and chief executive of Dyck O'Neal Inc., an Arlington, Texas, firm that invests in debt. "Before, it didn't make sense [for banks] to expend the resources to go after borrowers; now it doesn't make sense not to."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, $100,000 was roughly the average amount by which foreclosure sales fell short of loan balances in hundreds of foreclosures in seven states reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. And 64% of the 4.5 million foreclosures since the start of 2007 have taken place in states that allow deficiency judgments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders still sue for loan shortfalls in only a small minority of cases where they legally could. Public relations is a limiting factor, some debt-buyers believe. Banks are reluctant to discuss their strategies, but some lenders say they are more likely to seek a deficiency judgment if they perceive the borrower to be a "strategic defaulter" who chose to stop paying because the property lost so much value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Lee County, Fla., where Mr. Reilly's vacation home was, court records show that 172 deficiency judgments were entered in the first seven months of 2011. That was up 34% from a year earlier. The increase was especially striking because total foreclosures were down sharply in the county, as banks continued to wrestle with paperwork problems that slowed the process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One Florida lawyer who defends troubled homeowners, Matt Englett of Orlando, says his clients have faced 20 deficiency-judgment suits this year, up from seven during all of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently, "there was a false sense of calm" among borrowers who went through foreclosure, Mr. Englett says. "That's changing," he adds, as borrowers learn they may be financially on the hook even after the house is gone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Mr. Reilly's case, "there's not a snowball's chance in hell that we can pay" the deficiency judgment, says the 39-year-old man, who remains unemployed. He says he is going to speak to a lawyer about declaring bankruptcy next week, in an effort to escape the debt. The lender that obtained the judgment against him, Great Western Bank Corp. of Sioux Falls, S.D., declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some close observers of the housing scene are convinced this is just the beginning of a surge in deficiency judgments. Sharon Bock, clerk and comptroller of Palm Beach County, Fla., expects "a massive wave of these cases as banks start selling the judgments to debt collectors."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a paradox of the battered housing industry, trying to squeeze more money out of distressed borrowers contrasts with other initiatives that aim instead to help struggling homeowners, including by reducing what they owe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in deficiency judgments has sparked a growing secondary market. Sophisticated investors are "ravenous for this debt and ramping up their purchases," says Jeffrey Shachat, a managing director at Arca Capital Partners LLC, a Palo Alto, Calif., firm that finances distressed-debt deals. He says deficiency judgments will eventually be bundled into packages that resemble mortgage-backed securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because most targets have scant savings, the judgments sell for only about two cents on the dollar, versus seven cents for credit-card debt, according to debt-industry brokers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Silverleaf Advisors LLC, a Miami private-equity firm, is one investor in battered mortgage debt. Instead of buying ready-made deficiency judgments, it buys banks' soured mortgages and goes to court itself to get judgments for debt that remains after foreclosure sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Silverleaf says its collection efforts are limited. "We are waiting for the economy to somewhat heal so that it's a better time to go after people," says Douglas Hannah, managing director of Silverleaf.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors know that most states allow up to 20 years to try to collect the debts, ample time for the borrowers to get back on their feet. Meanwhile, the debts grow at about an 8% interest rate, depending on the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hannah expects the market to expand as banks "aggressively unload" their distressed mortgages in the next year, driving up the number of deficiency judgments being sought.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are pretty easy to get. "If the house sold for less than you owe, the lender wins, plain and simple," says Roy Foxall, a real-estate lawyer in Fort Myers on Florida's west coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Foxall says five deficiency suits were filed against his clients this year, and he couldn't poke any holes in any of them. Lenders typically have five years following a foreclosure sale to sue for remaining mortgage debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Englett, the Orlando lawyer who has handled 27 such suits for homeowners in the past 21 months, says he didn't get the bank to waive the deficiency in any of the cases, but did reach six settlements in which the plaintiff accepted less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Florida is among the biggest deficiency-judgment states. Since the start of 2007, it has had more foreclosures than any other state that allows deficiency judgments -- more than 9% of the U.S. total, according to research firm <span class="companylink">Lender Processing Services Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A loan-deficiency suit can yank borrowers back to a nightmare they thought was over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ray Falero, a truck driver whose Orlando home was foreclosed on and sold in August 2010, says he thought he was hallucinating when, months later, he opened the door and saw a sheriff's deputy. The visitor handed him a notice saying he was being sued for $78,500 by the lender on the home purchase, <span class="companylink">EverBank Financial Corp</span>., of Jacksonville, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I thought I was done with this whole mess," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Falero, 37, says he was about nine months behind on his loan when the bank foreclosed. Before it did, he bought another home in Minneola, Fla., where he now lives and where he says he is up to date on mortgage payments. Like Mr. Reilly, Mr. Falero says he didn't swell the foreclosed-on loan through refinancing or home-equity borrowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EverBank won a deficiency judgment on Mr. Falero's Orlando loan. Mr. Falero and his lawyer are fighting to reduce the amount owed. EverBank declined to comment on his case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Credit unions and smaller banks are the most aggressive pursuers of deficiency judgments, a review of court records in several states shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Suncoast Schools Federal Credit Union in Tampa, Jim Simon, manager of loss and risk mitigation, says the institution has a responsibility to its members, and that means trying to recoup losses by going after loan deficiencies. He calls such legal action the credit union's "last arrow in the quiver."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest banks appear to have stayed largely on the sidelines as they deal with the foreclosure-paperwork mess. One big bank, <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co</span>., "may obtain a deficiency" judgment in foreclosure cases but will "often waive" the leftover debt when a homeowner agrees to a so-called short sale of a house for less than is owed on it, a bank spokesman says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the hardest-hit spots in Florida is Lehigh Acres, a 95-square-mile unincorporated sprawl of narrow, cracked-pavement streets about 15 miles inland from Fort Myers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lehigh Acres was carved out of scrub land and cattle farms in the 1950s by a Chicago businessman, Lee Ratner, who had made a fortune on d-CON rat poison, says Gary Mormino, a history professor at the University of South Florida in St. Petersburg. Before he died, Mr. Ratner sold prefabricated houses to families hungry for a slice of paradise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Decades later, Lehigh Acres (population 68,265) attracted people eager to cash in on the housing boom, even though it is distant from the sugary white beaches on the Gulf of Mexico.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LEHIGH ACRES, Fla.—Joseph Reilly lost his vacation home here last year when he was out of work and stopped paying his mortgage. The bank took the house and sold it. Mr. Reilly thought that was the end of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, he learned otherwise. A phone call informed him of a court judgment against him for $192,576.71.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It turned out that at a foreclosure sale, his former house fetched less than a quarter of what Mr. Reilly owed on it. His bank sued him for the rest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result was a foreclosure hangover that homeowners rarely anticipate but increasingly face: a "deficiency judgment."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forty-one states and the District of Columbia permit lenders to sue borrowers for mortgage debt still left after a foreclosure sale. The economics of today's battered housing market mean that lenders are doing so more and more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosed homes seldom fetch enough to cover the outstanding loan amount, both because buyers financed so much of the purchase price—up to 100% of it during the housing boom—and because today's foreclosures take place following a four-year decline in values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Now there are foreclosures that leave banks holding the bag on more than $100,000 in debt," says Michael Cramer, president and chief executive of Dyck O'Neal Inc., an Arlington, Texas, firm that invests in debt. "Before, it didn't make sense [for banks] to expend the resources to go after borrowers; now it doesn't make sense not to."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, $100,000 was roughly the average amount by which foreclosure sales fell short of loan balances in hundreds of foreclosures in seven states reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. And 64% of the 4.5 million foreclosures since the start of 2007 have taken place in states that allow deficiency judgments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders still sue for loan shortfalls in only a small minority of cases where they legally could. Public relations is a limiting factor, some debt-buyers believe. Banks are reluctant to discuss their strategies, but some lenders say they are more likely to seek a deficiency judgment if they perceive the borrower to be a "strategic defaulter" who chose to stop paying because the property lost so much value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Lee County, Fla., where Mr. Reilly's vacation home was, court records show that 172 deficiency judgments were entered in the first seven months of 2011. That was up 34% from a year earlier. The increase was especially striking because total foreclosures were down sharply in the county, as banks continued to wrestle with paperwork problems that slowed the process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One Florida lawyer who defends troubled homeowners, Matt Englett of Orlando, says his clients have faced 20 deficiency-judgment suits this year, up from seven during all of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently, "there was a false sense of calm" among borrowers who went through foreclosure, Mr. Englett says. "That's changing," he adds, as borrowers learn they may be financially on the hook even after the house is gone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Mr. Reilly's case, "there's not a snowball's chance in hell that we can pay" the deficiency judgment, says the 39-year-old man, who remains unemployed. He says he is going to speak to a lawyer about declaring bankruptcy next week, in an effort to escape the debt. The lender that obtained the judgment against him, Great Western Bank Corp. of Sioux Falls, S.D., declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some close observers of the housing scene are convinced this is just the beginning of a surge in deficiency judgments. Sharon Bock, clerk and comptroller of Palm Beach County, Fla., expects "a massive wave of these cases as banks start selling the judgments to debt collectors."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a paradox of the battered housing industry, trying to squeeze more money out of distressed borrowers contrasts with other initiatives that aim instead to help struggling homeowners, including by reducing what they owe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in deficiency judgments has sparked a growing secondary market. Sophisticated investors are "ravenous for this debt and ramping up their purchases," says Jeffrey Shachat, a managing director at Arca Capital Partners LLC, a Palo Alto, Calif., firm that finances distressed-debt deals. He says deficiency judgments will eventually be bundled into packages that resemble mortgage-backed securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because most targets have scant savings, the judgments sell for only about two cents on the dollar, versus seven cents for credit-card debt, according to debt-industry brokers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Silverleaf Advisors LLC, a Miami private-equity firm, is one investor in battered mortgage debt. Instead of buying ready-made deficiency judgments, it buys banks' soured mortgages and goes to court itself to get judgments for debt that remains after foreclosure sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Silverleaf says its collection efforts are limited. "We are waiting for the economy to somewhat heal so that it's a better time to go after people," says Douglas Hannah, managing director of Silverleaf.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors know that most states allow up to 20 years to try to collect the debts, ample time for the borrowers to get back on their feet. Meanwhile, the debts grow at about an 8% interest rate, depending on the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hannah expects the market to expand as banks "aggressively unload" their distressed mortgages in the next year, driving up the number of deficiency judgments being sought.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are pretty easy to get. "If the house sold for less than you owe, the lender wins, plain and simple," says Roy Foxall, a real-estate lawyer in Fort Myers on Florida's west coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Foxall says five deficiency suits were filed against his clients this year, and he couldn't poke any holes in any of them. Lenders typically have five years following a foreclosure sale to sue for remaining mortgage debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Englett, the Orlando lawyer who has handled 27 such suits for homeowners in the past 21 months, says he didn't get the bank to waive the deficiency in any of the cases, but did reach six settlements in which the plaintiff accepted less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Florida is among the biggest deficiency-judgment states. Since the start of 2007, it has had more foreclosures than any other state that allows deficiency judgments—more than 9% of the U.S. total, according to research firm <span class="companylink">Lender Processing Services Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A loan-deficiency suit can yank borrowers back to a nightmare they thought was over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ray Falero, a truck driver whose Orlando home was foreclosed on and sold in August 2010, says he thought he was hallucinating when, months later, he opened the door and saw a sheriff's deputy. The visitor handed him a notice saying he was being sued for $78,500 by the lender on the home purchase, <span class="companylink">EverBank Financial Corp</span>., of Jacksonville, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I thought I was done with this whole mess," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Falero, 37, says he was about nine months behind on his loan when the bank foreclosed. Before it did, he bought another home in Minneola, Fla., where he now lives and where he says he is up to date on mortgage payments. Like Mr. Reilly, Mr. Falero says he didn't swell the foreclosed-on loan through refinancing or home-equity borrowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EverBank won a deficiency judgment on Mr. Falero's Orlando loan. Mr. Falero and his lawyer are fighting to reduce the amount owed. EverBank declined to comment on his case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Credit unions and smaller banks are the most aggressive pursuers of deficiency judgments, a review of court records in several states shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Suncoast Schools Federal Credit Union in Tampa, Jim Simon, manager of loss and risk mitigation, says the institution has a responsibility to its members, and that means trying to recoup losses by going after loan deficiencies. He calls such legal action the credit union's "last arrow in the quiver."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest banks appear to have stayed largely on the sidelines as they deal with the foreclosure-paperwork mess. One big bank, <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co</span>., "may obtain a deficiency" judgment in foreclosure cases but will "often waive" the leftover debt when a homeowner agrees to a so-called short sale of a house for less than is owed on it, a bank spokesman says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the hardest-hit spots in Florida is Lehigh Acres, a 95-square-mile unincorporated sprawl of narrow, cracked-pavement streets about 15 miles inland from Fort Myers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lehigh Acres was carved out of scrub land and cattle farms in the 1950s by a Chicago businessman, Lee Ratner, who had made a fortune on d-CON rat poison, says Gary Mormino, a history professor at the University of South Florida in St. Petersburg. Before he died, Mr. Ratner sold prefabricated houses to families hungry for a slice of paradise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Decades later, Lehigh Acres (population 68,265) attracted people eager to cash in on the housing boom, even though it is distant from the sugary white beaches on the Gulf of Mexico. Speculative investors bought more than half of homes sold in Lehigh Acres in 2005 and 2006, Bob Peterson, a real-estate agent, estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of those stucco homes now stand empty, priced at about a third of the value they had at the peak of the housing boom, which was often around $300,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first seven months of this year, courts entered 42 deficiency judgments in Lehigh Acres, for a total of $7 million, up from 26 judgments for $4.6 million in the same period of 2010, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of state-court records.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An index that tracks contracts to buy previously owned U.S. homes fell 1.2% in August, clouding an already-bleak outlook for the housing sector, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index of pending home sales, which reflects contracts signed but deals not yet closed, fell to 88.6 from 89.7 in July. That is higher than August 2010 -- but last year's levels plummeted after a federal tax credit for homebuyers expired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Northeast saw the biggest declines, which the trade group partly blamed on Hurricane Irene delaying deals. NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun also cited tight credit conditions and Americans' hesitance to form households, such as college graduates and new entrants to the work force still living with their parents, amid an uncertain economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Citing record-low interest rates and rock-bottom home prices, economists say the housing market should be much further along in recovering. "It's a pretty good time to get involved in the market, but a lot of people are unable to take advantage of this situation," said Paul Dales, senior U.S. economist for Capital Economics, a macroeconomic consultancy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dales partly blamed the weak labor market and stagnant income growth. "There also is a general decrease in the desire of people to own a home," he said. "Under normal times, the housing market would rebound very quickly. But the legacy of recession and the financial crisis means that won't happen."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has remained sluggish despite mortgage rates that have fallen to their lowest levels in more than 60 years. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 4.01% for the week ended Thursday, according to a survey by <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, mortgage delinquencies ticked up during the second quarter after declining for five quarters, according to a report released Thursday by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. While mortgage delinquencies typically rise in the second quarter from the first, analysts said it was possible that more people were falling behind on their mortgages because of the soft job market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 12% of Americans with mortgages had missed at least one mortgage payment or were in foreclosure during the second quarter, up from 11.4% in the first quarter. "It's something to clearly watch to see where this is going," said Joseph Evers, the OCC's deputy comptroller for large-bank supervision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The delinquency numbers underscore how much harder it will be for the housing market to recover if the economy doesn't keep adding jobs.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Tess Stynes and Kathleen Madigan   </div><div>528 words</div><div>28 September 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices rose for a fourth consecutive month in July but remain down from last year, according to S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices, as the housing market continues to struggle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separate data on consumer sentiment released Tuesday showed just how shaky the economy remains. The Conference Board, a private research group, said its index of consumer confidence barely changed in September, edging up to 45.4 from a dismal 45.2 in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two data points, like other recent indicators, suggest the economy is growing but remains vulnerable to a new shock. Economists said the improvements in both home prices and consumer confidence were too small to suggest a meaningful improvement in the broader economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While we have now seen four consecutive months of generally increasing prices, we do know that we are still far from a sustained recovery," said David Blitzer, chairman of S&amp;P's index committee. "Continued increases in home prices through the end of the year and better annual results must materialize before we can confirm a housing market recovery."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices rose in July from June in 17 of the 20 major U.S. metropolitan markets included in the monthly survey, led by 3.8% growth in Detroit. Las Vegas and Phoenix saw declines of 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively. Denver was unchanged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, with the exception of Detroit and Washington, prices were down year-to-year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, the 20-city index rose 0.9% in July from June. Adjusting for seasonal factors, however, the index was flat. A smaller index of 10 major cities also rose 0.9% from June but fell 0.1% when seasonal factors were included. Year-to-year, unadjusted July prices fell 3.7% for the 10 major markets while the 20-city index was down 4.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has been struggling amid high unemployment, foreclosures and tighter mortgage requirements. Home prices rose in April for the first time in eight months, though most of the improvement was believed to reflect the beginning of the spring-summer buying season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors last week reported existing home sales in August rose 7.7% from July. Foreclosure sales and "short sales," where lenders allow homeowners to sell houses for less than the value of existing loans and forgive the difference, accounted for 31% of sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer confidence, meanwhile, fell short even of economists' muted predictions. The present situation index, a gauge of consumers' assessment of current economic conditions, fell further to 32.5 from a revised 34.3, originally put at 33.3.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conference Board's confidence index, which is on a 100-point scale, hit its most recent peak in February at 72.0.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The present-sentiment index has fallen for five consecutive months, "a sign that the economic environment remains weak," said Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board Consumer Research Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Consumers expressed greater concern about their expected earnings," Ms. Franco said, "a sign that does not bode well for spending."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Joseph B. White and Nick Timiraos </div><div>665 words</div><div>28 September 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the recovering auto industry, Detroit's housing market is showing signs of new life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the nation's 20 largest metro areas surveyed for the latest S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price index, released Tuesday, only Detroit and Washington, D.C. registered higher home prices in July than a year earlier. Detroit was up 1.2% from July 2010; Washington edged up 0.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Detroit's housing market is a long way from robust, and the recent improvement is small compared with the value lost during the collapse that began in 2007. Still, there are signs that Detroit's residential real-estate values may be stabilizing -- at levels comparable to 1995, and nearly 43% below their peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The painful shakeout in the auto industry, which hit bottom in 2009 with the bankruptcies of <span class="companylink">General Motors Co</span>. and Chrysler Group LLC, cost the Detroit region thousands of jobs. But the restructuring helped Detroit's auto makers and earn profits at far lower sales volumes than in the past. That has translated to promises of larger profit-sharing checks for assembly-line workers, bigger bonuses for executives and more money for the surviving suppliers in the region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Likewise, the collapse of housing values has made it easier for younger buyers, and those who have jobs, to consider buying. With Detroit area home prices so low, "the rent-ownership relationship dramatically favors buying," said Bob Walters, chief economist with Quicken Loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agents say the market showed signs of recovery this spring as more buyers grew comfortable with their job prospects. "From 2004 through 2009, even though the Big Three laid off 20% of their work force, 100% of the work force was not going to buy a house," said Dan Elsea, president of brokerage services for Real Estate One in the Detroit area. "We had a total freeze on activity." But over the past six months, there has been a "burst of activity," as consumers become more confident about the auto-sector recovery, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the inventory of homes listed for sale at the end of August was down 29% from a year earlier, according to Realtor.com. That is leading to bidding wars. "Buyers are paying $30,000 or $40,000 above the asking price," said Ben Lang, a real-estate agent in suburban Troy. According to Realtor.com, the median asking price of a listed home in August in the Detroit area was $93,000, compared with $189,900 nationally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Glenn Stewart signed a contract in July to buy a new house in Lyon Township and will move into the four-bedroom home next February. "We didn't know if home prices were going to go any lower, and with interest rates so low, we couldn't turn our back on it," said the 49-year-old police officer. Mr. Stewart sold his Livonia home, which he bought 13 years ago, in just two weeks this past July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It all gives the region another thing to celebrate, along with its playoff-bound Tigers in baseball and undefeated Lions in football. Still, the Detroit housing recovery remains a work in progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It still feels like we are a year to a year and a half away from a fundamental turning point," said Robert Dye, chief economist with Comerica Bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Detroit region still has a large overhang of homes that are bank-owned or in some stage of foreclosure -- more than 46,000, according to RealtyTrac. And homes in the city of Detroit can still be a tough sell. Ryan Cooley, of O'Connor Realty, said appraisers are still assigning low values to many Detroit houses, threatening to derail deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I had a house put under contract for $80,000," he said. "It appraised for $30,000."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales fell for the fourth straight month in August to the lowest level in a half-year as the bursting of the housing bubble continued to plague the U.S. economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales fell 2.3% on a monthly basis to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 295,000, the Commerce Department said Monday. The pace was the weakest in six months, and the month was the seventh-worst on record dating to 1963.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results, however, were in line with forecasts, and July's results were revised upward slightly to a rate of 302,000. Compared with a year earlier, when new-home sales hit a record-low pace of 278,000, new-home sales were up 6.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Turmoil in financial markets after <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> unprecedented downgrade of U.S. debt, fears of a renewed recession and Hurricane Irene all combined to keep buyers away in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given those factors, "we are moderately relieved at this number," wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics. "Still, the market is dead, and even record-low mortgage rates are not doing anything to help."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales are down nearly 80% from their peak in July 2005. They remain far below healthy levels, considered to be an annual rate of about 750,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers have slowed their spending this year, pulling down economic growth and preventing unemployment from falling. Many people can't get financing because of tight lending standards enacted after the housing bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weak state of the housing market has concerned the Obama administration and Federal Reserve. The Obama administration and federal regulators are working on steps to allow more borrowers to refinance at ultralow rates. Last week, the Fed announced it would begin putting payments from its portfolio of government-backed mortgage bonds back into mortgages. That pushed down mortgage rates to below 4% for a 30-year fixed loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the Fed's move isn't expected to do much for home purchases. Many people aren't buying -- and sellers aren't selling -- homes because prices keep dropping. The median price in August for a new home, at $209,100, was down 7.7% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers who are buying homes often are opting for foreclosed properties and other previously owned homes, which tend to be less expensive than new houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With builders keeping new-home construction to a minimum, the number of new homes listed for sale at the end of August was 162,000, the lowest level on record dating back to 1963. That supply would take 6.6 months to deplete at the current sales pace, around a healthy level. The supply in July was 6.5 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the inventory of new homes is healthy, that supply "continues to be dwarfed by the massive overhang of existing homes for sale," including foreclosures and other properties, wrote Dan Oppenheim, a home-builder analyst with <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Firms controlled by mortgage-bond pioneer Lewis Ranieri and billionaire investor Wilbur Ross are partnering to buy <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> Berkshire Mortgage, a major lender to investors in U.S. apartment buildings, the companies said today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ranieri Real Estate Partners LP and private-equity funds affiliated with <span class="companylink">WL Ross &amp; Co</span>. are paying an undisclosed amount for the unit of <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank AG</span>, which makes loans to apartment-building owners and then sells them to <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. The unit originated more than $4 billion a year in mortgage loans at the market's peak and is the second-largest originator of <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>-backed multi-family loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal reflects the strength of the multifamily market, which has bounced back faster than other types of commercial real estate, such as office and retail. Demand for rental apartments has been strong as the home-ownership market has continued to suffer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many are betting that home-ownership rates will stay low, buoying the apartment sector for some time to come. Still, the sector could take a hit if the economy declines, and the commercial real estate market has generally begun to cool recently. The U.S. Census Bureau reported last week that multifamily construction starts in August were down 10.3% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal, which hasn't yet closed, comes as other investors have been buying up competitors. In May 2010, a group led by <span class="companylink">Orix Corp</span>. bought <span class="companylink">Red Capital Group</span>, another <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> multifamily lender, from <span class="companylink">PNC Bank</span>. And in June 2010, <span class="companylink">Fortress Investment Group LLC</span> bought CW Financial Services, a broader commercial real estate firm that made loans for Fannie and Freddie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Berkshire Mortgage unit also services some $28 billion in multifamily loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The acquisition is the first major deal for Ranieri Real Estate Partners LP, the commercial real-estate arm of Ranieri Partners, a real-estate services company founded by Mr. Ranieri in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commercial subsidiary is run by Jon Vaccaro, who previously headed up commercial real-estate lending for <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The acquisition would reunite Mr. Vaccaro with the Berkshire group, which was under his control at <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>. The unit was purchased by the bank in 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lending to multifamily investors has grown over the past two years as the market began to recover. A Mortgage Bankers Association's index for the second quarter found that multifamily lending had nearly returned to 2006 levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A fund controlled by Ranieri Real Estate Partners reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission last week that it had raised $158 million.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Alan Zibel                And Jeff Bater   </div><div>674 words</div><div>22 September 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously occupied homes in the U.S. rose in August to the highest level in five months but remained weak overall as the sputtering housing market fails to propel the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales increased 7.7% from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.03 million, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the results were better than forecast, they weren't seen as a sign of recovery in the battered housing market or the broader economy. And two other reports on housing this week have been negative: Government figures showed a 5% monthly decline in new-home construction, while builders reported a drop in confidence about the struggling sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With economic growth sputtering, the modest recovery we have seen so far in home sales is likely to become even more sluggish," wrote Sam Bullard, senior economist at <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo Securities</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The month's sales "should not be mistaken for evidence that a real recovery is beginning" for the housing market, wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales had been expected to rise by 2.7% to an annual rate of 4.80 million, according to economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the monthly increase in sales, the U.S. continues to struggle with the aftermath of the worst housing bust in decades. Last year was the worst for existing-home sales since 1997. This year's sales are on track to be slightly better. The Realtors group forecasts 4.92 million homes will be sold this year, up slightly from 4.91 million in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices, meanwhile, are expected to drop 2.5% this year and rise just 1.1% annually through 2015, according to a survey of more than 100 economists released Wednesday by MacroMarkets LLC. The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday cut its 2012 growth forecast for the U.S. to 1.8%, from 2.7%, citing a weak housing market as a key negative factor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors group said the monthly increase resulted from closings of sales that had bogged down earlier in the summer due to tight mortgage-lending standards and problems with appraisals. However, cancellations of sales remained high. A survey of real-estate agents found that 18% of buyers who signed contracts for properties wound up canceling them in August—double last year's rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales were up 18.6% from August 2010. But year-ago sales were weak due to the expiration of a federal tax credit that had boosted sales in the spring and early summer. Home prices, meanwhile, continued to be weak. The median sales price was $168,300, down 5.1% from $177,300 a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of previously owned homes listed for sale fell at the end of August to 3.58 million. That works out to a 8.5-month supply at the current sales pace, compared with a healthy level of about six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing sector faces even more trouble at the end of this month, when the maximum size of loans that can be backed by government-controlled mortgage companies <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and the Federal Housing Administration declines. Congress can prevent those limits from falling, but appears unlikely to act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new limits vary by location, but will drop to $625,500 in expensive markets such as New York, Los Angeles and Washington from the current $729,750.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many Republicans see letting the limits drop as a way to reduce the U.S. mortgage market's dependence on federal support. But Democrats, mainly from coastal states, want to maintain the current limits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors' report said home sales grew last month compared with a month earlier in all four regions. Sales were up 18.3% in the West, 5.4% in the South, 3.8% in the Midwest and 2.7% in the Northeast.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jittery investors, wary banks, the struggling economy and turbulent financial markets are stalling a two-year rebound in the U.S. commercial real-estate industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the country, companies that were looking for large chunks of office space have delayed those plans as uncertainty has risen. Among those companies that have changed or are re-evaluating plans areUBS AG, <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> and the Quidsi unit of <span class="companylink">Amazon.com Inc</span>., all of which were looking in New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building purchases are also falling apart because of financing snags. Commercial real-estate values have barely budged since the late spring. And a growing number of projects dreamed up when the stock market and U.S. economy were on the rise now can't get off the drawing board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are today as worried about the economy as we were several years ago," Mortimer Zuckerman, chairman of office landlord <span class="companylink">Boston Properties Inc</span>. said at a conference earlier this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The casualties include a failed sale of the St. Regis Monarch Beach, a resort in Dana Point, Calif., after <span class="companylink">Host Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc</span>. this month terminated a contract to buy the five-star resort from Washington Real Estate Holdings LLC, according to people familiar with the talks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Host walked away from the deal due to the negative impact of recent economic instability on hotel values and the properties' projected cash flows, these people said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger's plans to convert the Metropolitan Life clock tower, a 1909 office building near Manhattan's Madison Square Park, into a hotel and luxury condo collapsed this month after Mr. Hilfiger and his investment partner weren't able to secure enough financing, according to people familiar with the situation. The $170 million sale was revealed in the spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An executive at Mr. Hilfiger's private office said the designer has the capital but pulled out to pursue "other projects that may make more sense for us."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some investors view the recent turbulence as little more than a bump before commercial real-estate values resume their upward march toward near-peak levels in areas such as New York City and Washington, D.C. Top buildings in major cities still are attractive to many investors because of ultra-low interest rates, while prices and rents remain lofty in niches such as high-end retail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're still optimistic about the recovery," said Marc Halle, a managing director at <span class="companylink">Prudential Real Estate</span> Investors, a <span class="companylink">Prudential Financial Inc</span>. unit that is a major commercial-property investor. "Obviously, the events of the past few weeks have slowed the market [but] not derailed the market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the two-year recovery was fueled partly by expectations that rents and occupancies would keep rising. Now those trends look doubtful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Washington, D.C. area, one of the nation's strongest real-estate markets, commercial landlords are worried about long-term plans by the U.S. government to cut spending. New York City is being squeezed by turmoil on Wall Street, including announced job cuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the slowdown accelerates, some real-estate experts are worried that the amount of vacant space in office buildings, retail stores and other types of commercial real estate might climb, while rental rates slip. As of June 30, the overall vacancy rate for office space was about 18%, basically unchanged from the post-real-estate-boom peak, according to research firm <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other analysts are concerned about the possibility of a jump in troubled commercial loans at banks that have spent the past two years digging out from the recession and real-estate meltdown. Troubled commercial real-estate loans have been one of the biggest contributors to the nation's nearly 400 bank failures since the start of 2008, <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank AG</span> analysts wrote in a report last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. banks might face more headaches over the $1.4 trillion in commercial real-estate loans still on their books.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Many small and some medium sized institutions remain unprepared for the harsh realities ahead," given their limited capital to deal with billions in troubled mortgages, the <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> report warns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commercial real-estate market reflects and often magnifies broader swings in the economy. When times are good, growing employment translates into new demand for offices and hotels, rippling through the economy with new construction investments. But when the outlook sinks, new building grinds to a halt, empty space soars and prices fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first half of 2011, U.S. commercial property sales were one of the brightest spots in the U.S. economy, up 107% over the same period a year earlier, with firms completing more than $93 billion in deals, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics Inc</span>., a real-estate research firm. In July, the sales increase slowed to 16%, and it decelerated to about 13% in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A widely followed measurement of U.S. commercial-property values, the Green Street Advisors Commercial Property Price Index, is up just 1% in the past four months. Before then, the index had surged 48% since May 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 70% of the architecture firms recently contacted by the American Institute of Architects in its monthly survey reported that they have at least one stalled project, according to Kermit Baker, the institute's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The most common reason by a fairly wide margin is the inability of the developer to obtain financing," he said in an interview.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos </div><div>1043 words</div><div>21 September 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists, builders and mortgage analysts are predicting the weakened U.S. economy will depress housing prices for years, restraining consumer spending, pushing more homeowners into foreclosure and clouding prospects for a sustained recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are expected to drop 2.5% this year and rise just 1.1% annually through 2015, according to a recent survey of more than 100 economists to be released Wednesday. Prices have already fallen 31.6% from their 2005 peak, as measured by the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller 20-city index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the economists' forecast is accurate, it means housing faces a lost decade in which home prices recover just a fraction of what was lost between 2005 and 2015, leaving millions of homeowners with little, if any, equity in their homes. The survey was conducted for MacroMarkets LLC, a financial technology company co-founded by Yale University economist Robert Shiller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing bust has chilled consumer spending -- the largest single driver of the U.S. economy -- with eroding home equity contributing to the so-called reverse wealth effect that prompts people to spend cautiously because they feel poorer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One in five Americans with a mortgage owes more than their home is worth, and $7 trillion of homeowners' equity has been lost in the bust. Homeowners' equity as a share of home values has fallen to 38.6% from 59.7% in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With all of the economic turmoil, both domestic and international, there's not much that points to an improving housing market at any point in the near future," said Ara Hovnanian, chief executive of <span class="companylink">Hovnanian Enterprises Inc</span>., the U.S.'s seventh-largest builder by deliveries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While home prices aren't falling at anywhere near the pace of 2008, one worry is that even modest declines become self-reinforcing, pushing more homeowners underwater and exacerbating the downdraft caused by more foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, in turn, could prompt more credit tightening by lenders, further shrinking the pool of home buyers when more are needed to purchase bank-owned foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing bust is weighing on the economy in part because bank-owned foreclosures have sidelined new construction, a traditional employment engine following a downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said Tuesday that single-family housing starts fell by 1.4% in August from July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 417,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past 35 years, housing has contributed just 0.03 percentage point to annual growth in gross domestic product, according to research from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. But in the two years following most recessions, housing adds around 0.5 percentage point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, that contribution has been negative. The housing market needs the economy to add jobs, but the economy isn't able to rely on the job boost housing normally provides in a recovery. "We're in uncharted territory," said David Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fallout from the housing bust hasn't been easy on Greg Rubin, owner of California's Own Native Landscape Design, a landscape contractor in Escondido, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With sales down by half from 2007, Mr. Rubin has reduced his work force to nine people from 21. He now does jobs for as little as $4,000 versus no less than $10,000 in the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With home values no longer increasing, the few people who are hiring Mr. Rubin are paying with cash savings instead of home-equity loans, substantially decreasing their purchasing power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, Mr. Rubin said, home prices have been battered for so long that many people have stopped believing home improvements will increase the value of their property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's this psychology that home prices are dropping independent of whatever improvements they make, so it's a lost cause to do them now," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising home prices traditionally lead homeowners to spend more money, even during periods of economic sluggishness, creating jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But "that cycle can cut the other way," said James Parrott, a top White House housing adviser. "As the value of a family's home drops, that can really go from a lever of savings to a drain on that savings."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those concerns prompted the White House earlier this year to begin canvassing experts on how to attack the excess inventory of distressed properties and troubled mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials are studying ways to encourage banks to write down loan balances for borrowers that are seriously underwater and to allow more underwater borrowers with government-backed loans to take advantage of low mortgage rates by refinancing. They are also working with federal regulators to study ways to rent out or clear the inventory of foreclosed homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier initiatives encouraging banks to voluntarily modify mortgages haven't reached as many borrowers as hoped, hindered in part by stubbornly high unemployment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks hold nearly 500,000 homes on their books, but more than four million additional loans are in some stage of foreclosure or are considered "seriously delinquent" because they have missed three or more payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That bad debt is "dragging the nation's economy underwater," said Lewis Ranieri, the pioneer of the mortgage-bond market, in a speech warning of the growing risks of policy inaction at a conference Monday. "In truth, we seem very paralyzed and slow to act," he said, chiding policy makers and industry executives for "wasting time engaging in self-interested bickering" while the housing market rots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While mortgage rates have fallen to their lowest levels in decades, applications for home-purchase mortgages are mired near 15-year lows, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Applicants today face "a mountain of paperwork and never-ending reverifications," said Stuart Miller, chief executive of home builder <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>., in an earnings call Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bust has hit some markets harder than others. In Nevada, Arizona and Florida, many homeowners can't move to take new jobs because they owe far more than their homes are worth. But even some markets that have shown resilience over the past year, such as Washington, D.C., could be at risk if job growth peters out.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home construction fell more than expected in August to the lowest level in three months as the faltering industry remained one of the weakest parts of the sluggish economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of homes and apartments last month decreased 5.0% from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 571,000, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. The month's results were pulled down by a nearly 30% drop in the Northeastern states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with the same month a year earlier, new-home construction in August was down 5.8%. Figures for July were revised downward to an annualized pace of 601,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction remained below a healthy level, which economists say would be around 1 million to 1.5 million starts per year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, builders appear to be ramping up for more construction projects. Newly issued building permits, a gauge of future construction, rose 3.2% from a month earlier to an annual rate of 620,000, the highest level since last December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires expected housing starts would fall by 2.3% to an annual rate of 590,000. Permits had been projected to fall 1.8% to an annual rate of 590,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation's home builders have been battling the worst downturn in generations. New-home sales have been weak, partly due to competition from deeply discounted foreclosed properties. Other troubles for the industry include tight mortgage-lending standards and the elevated unemployment rate, both of which are sapping demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, new-home sales fell to their lowest level in five months as consumers grew more jittery about weakening economic conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of single-family homes, which made up 73% of all starts, fell by 1.4% from a month earlier. Construction of multifamily homes with at least two units, a volatile part of the market, was down 13.5% on a monthly basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders are remaining idle due to lackluster demand from buyers. Many buyers have been choosing foreclosures and other previously owned homes rather than new homes, which typically are more expensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reflecting weak demand, fewer homes were under construction in August than at any time on records dating back to 1970.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders have also had problems getting financing to start projects and have been coping with rising costs for materials. They have been gloomy about the industry's outlook. On Monday, the National Association of Home Builders said its index of builders' confidence fell to 14 in September, down from 15 a month earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Readings above 50 indicate that more builders view conditions as good rather than poor. The last time the home builders' confidence gauge was in positive territory was April 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>. said its earnings for the fiscal third quarter slumped 31% as the big home builder delivered fewer homes than a year earlier. However, new-home orders climbed, and the company said Monday that it expects to be profitable in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department data showed that housing starts fell on a monthly basis in two out of four U.S. regions. They fell 29.1% in the Northeast and 3.3% in the South but rose 2.6% in the Midwest and 2.2% in the West.</p>

</div><div class="author">By A.D. Pruitt  </div><div>862 words</div><div>14 September 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few months ago, real-estate companies that invest in mortgage securities were one of the hottest sectors among companies planning initial public offerings of stock. Now, however, they are among the least likely to go public anytime soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the beginning of the year, nine real-estate investment trusts have filed to sell a total of roughly $2.5 billion in shares of new mortgage REITs, the largest volume of deals since 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current pipeline includes a $600 million offering from <span class="companylink">Pacific Investment Management Co</span>., one of the world's largest bond investors, and a $500 million deal by a unit of hedge fund <span class="companylink">Fortress Investment Group LLC</span>, which will buy subprime loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the remaining five pending mortgage REITs eventually go public, then the entire pool of publicly traded mortgage REITs will grow to 28 from the 23 that the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts had on record through August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Securities and Exchange Commission threw a monkey wrench in the IPO plans recently, when it launched a review that could determine whether mortgage REITs should continue to be unregulated companies or whether they should be subjected, like mutual funds, to the Investment Act of 1940. Among other things, the act sets limits on the amount of leverage a fund can use and regulates the fees that can be charged to investors. Companies that invest the majority of their assets in real estate have always been exempted from the Investment Act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now, the SEC appears to be making a distinction between REITs that manage and operate real estate versus REITs that invest in real-estate securities. If the SEC determines that mortgage REITs shouldn't qualify for exemption, the companies will lose the ability to use hefty amounts of leverage, or borrowed capital, to boost returns and provide high dividends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High leverage has allowed mortgage REITs, on average, to produce dividend yields of 15% for the year so far, compared with 3.8% for the overall REIT market, as calculated by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There doesn't appear to be a specific market event that prompted the SEC's review. But the regulator noted in a so-called concept release that it was concerned about excessive leverage, given its role in fueling the financial crisis and inflated asset values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For mortgage REITs planning to go public, the SEC scrutiny "will be a very tough sell," says Scott Sweet, managing director of research firm IPOBoutique.com. "If IPO investors know that the REIT structure could change down the road, they will likely stand clear of new IPOs." He adds that mortgage REITs and REITs in general are among the worst-performing sectors in the IPO market this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He notes that many mortgage REITs are managed by an outside adviser, and regulation could reduce the advisory fees that advisers get paid in the future if the regulation is passed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs were established in 1960 to give individuals a convenient way to invest in commercial real estate-office buildings, shopping malls, apartment buildings, hotels and other income-producing properties -- without actually buying properties. REITs by law must pay at least 90% of their taxable income as dividends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most REITs buy or develop and manage buildings. But mortgage REITs have always been different. They invest in debt secured by residential and commercial mortgages, similar to many mutual funds focused on real estate. As such, the SEC is raising the question of whether there is a fine line between the mortgage REITs and the investment companies that buy similar securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This puts IPO candidates in a tricky situation. They risk becoming a REIT with a business strategy that might not pass regulatory muster down the line. Investors may not want to take a chance on new companies amid the likelihood that they won't deliver high dividends and handsome returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The IPOs will be a tougher story" for companies, says Kenneth Steele, chief financial officer for <span class="companylink">Hatteras Financial Corp</span>., a mortgage REIT based in Winston Salem, N.C. He adds that this may "shut the door" on companies that have been waiting to price deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In the worst-case scenario, we would need to shut down or find another way to operate in another form," Mr. Steele adds, referring to the consequences of regulation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even before the SEC review, investors' appetite for mortgage-REITs' IPOs was starting to fade because of the stock-market volatility and perceptions that existing mortgage REITs offered the potential for better returns. A handful of mortgage-REIT candidates, including the Pimco and Fortress deals, are stuck in the pipeline and comprise more than half of the REITs anxious to go public. A few companies made it out of the chute in recent months, but only after making big concessions, including sharply cutting offering amounts and prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the SEC provides informal guidance to REITs on which securities qualify for exemption, it largely relies on an honor system, where companies must play by the rules without a formal check.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traditional investments are delivering low returns, and home prices are at bargain levels. Is it time to consider buying some rental housing?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investing in real estate right now can be surprisingly profitable, if everything goes well. Rents are climbing in many areas, and more properties may be coming on the market. Last month, the Obama administration asked for proposals on how to convert at least some of <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>'s and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>'s bulging inventories of foreclosed homes into affordable rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors used to aim for rents that were 1% of the purchase price, or $1,000 a month for a $100,000 home—an annual gross return of 12%—says Michael McCreary. His firm, McCreary Realty, manages about 300 properties in the Atlanta area. Today, he says, some of his investors are getting as much as 2% of the purchase price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In general, though, average returns after expenses are far less, more like 5% to 6% of the property value, says Ingo Winzer, president of Local Market Monitor, a real-estate forecasting firm. But that still is well above what many other investments yield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before you start scouring for deals, keep in mind that owning rental properties is time-consuming, expensive and fraught with challenges, and many investors lose money. You will want to avoid falling into one of these common traps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Mistake 1: Confusing a cheap deal for a good deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is true that you can buy some homes for ridiculously low prices—but that doesn't mean you can rent them out. Homes in deserted subdivisions aren't any more appealing to renters than they are to buyers. The same is true for less-attractive properties or those in less-desirable school districts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors from the San Francisco area often look at the Sacramento market assuming they can get Bay Area-like rents, and end up overpaying, says Robert A. Machado of HomePointe Property Management. He uses several resources, including the website FinestExpert.com[http://www.finestexpert.com/], to estimate rents. Other experts suggest canvassing apartments nearby to see not just their rates, but whether they are offering special deals, like a couple of months of free rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Mistake 2: Overlooking key costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Knowing the potential rent isn't enough. Before you buy a property, you should also factor in closing costs of 3% to 6%, the costs to fix up the place and maintain it, and your holding costs. Then add the profit you expect to make (and more closing costs, if you intend to turn around and sell it). Only then can you figure out what you can afford to pay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Mistake 3: Forgetting that time is money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In real estate, "time is your biggest enemy," says David Hicks, co-president of HomeVestors of America, a franchiser whose motto is "We Buy Ugly Houses." You lose money when your property is empty, whether you are painting it or between tenants. You also lose if you buy in the fall and can't replace the roof until spring. You may be better off accepting a lower rent than waiting for a higher-paying tenant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Mistake 4: Assuming you will sit back and watch the rent roll in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When you become a landlord, you become a rent collector," says Mark Kreditor of Get There First Realty, which manages 1,600 rentals in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just like homeowners who can't pay the mortgage, tenants lose their jobs and stop paying the rent. Evicting them can take several weeks, and some steal appliances or other property. Mr. Kreditor says that once or twice a month, a tenant removes a home's copper tubing on the way out the door to sell the copper for its meltdown value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You will need to screen prospective tenants carefully—or pay someone to do it for you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Mistake 5: Underestimating repair costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As with all homes, you will be making lots of repairs. You may find wood rot or mold when you remove that cracked bathtub. Carpet in rental homes typically must be replaced every five years, and you may have to repaint after every tenant. Tony A. Drost, president of the National Association of Residential Property Managers, or Narpm, suggests setting aside six months of expenses so that you will have funds if a major repair is needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Mistake 6: Assuming that owning a rental is the same as owning a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You might put up with flaws in a home that a renter wouldn't tolerate. In addition, many states and communities have strict (and complex) laws for landlords, even if you own only one property. A property manager can handle most of the headaches, but you should expect to pay one up to a month of rent for finding and screening tenants—and up to 10% of the monthly rent for management fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can find property managers through the websites of trade groups Narpm[http://www.narpm.org/] and the Institute of Real Estate Management[http://www.irem.org/]. In addition, many communities have local Real Estate Investor Associations, which can provide support.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past few years, scaffolding and stop-work orders have been as common a sight on the streets of Williamsburg as popular new restaurants and bearded young hipsters. But in a dramatic turnaround, at least eight stalled residential developments are coming back to life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After more than three years of neighborhood battles, units at the notorious "Finger Building" on North Eighth Street will hit the market later this month, according to the developer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices at the newly finished 14-story building, now dubbed simply 144 N. Eighth St., will range from $550,000 for one-bedrooms to upward of $2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GFI Development Co., the company behind the Ace Hotels in New York and Palm Springs, bought the half-finished project in 2008 and redesigned it with features such as an 18,000-square-foot outdoor garden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building's original developer, Menrep Brach, planned a 16-story tower that elicited outrage from community groups, who said it stuck out above the neighboring low-rise buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project eventually stalled because of a dispute with an adjoining building over air rights, and Mr. Brach subsequently sold the loan. In 2009 Mr. Brach was barred by the state attorney general from sponsoring co-ops and condos after the office determined he took advantage of a faculty-housing exemption to build a nine-story condo in Bedford-Stuyvesant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as the "Finger Building" readies for its close-up, other previously stalled sites around the neighborhood are moving forward in a flurry of construction activity not seen in Williamsburg, or in many other neighborhoods in the city, since early 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others warn the optimism could be premature, saying construction financing for condo projects remains extremely tight, and the economy as a whole could be heading for another dip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices for land also have nearly doubled in the past year to 18 months, raising questions about whether developers who are buying now can make a return on that investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't think it's justified. The market is still waiting to stabilize," said Abraham Bennun of Triton Realty Group, the developer of a new condo and townhouse development at 197 Berry St. He bought the land in March 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He now plans to finish the project by April or May, with studios starting in the $300,000 range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a great time for buyers, Mr. Bennun said, but he cautioned developers: "The question for me is whether the market will continue to grow at the same pace as we've seen over the last 2½ years."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2005, developers rushed to the neighborhood following the rezoning of North Williamsburg and Greenpoint. Dozens of run-down warehouses or empty lots were soon plastered with building permits. At the 2006 peak, there were nearly 50 new developments, all of them selling units at the same time, according to MNS Realty, which advises developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The neighborhood, once a poor and working-class enclave of Latinos and religious Jews, suffered a major blow during the recession, when condo prices dropped from a high of $800 a square foot to about $650 a square foot in 2009, according to MNS. They have since started to climb back up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financing for new condo projects became almost impossible to secure, and the neighborhood was soon littered with stalled sites. The media "almost declared it a disaster zone," said David Behin, a partner at MNS Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But developers insist that's led to a shortage of new inventory as the neighborhood has become flooded with not only artists and hipsters but young families and professionals from Manhattan looking to take advantage of its restaurants and lower prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand has risen sharply for units at the Edge, which, with 565 market-rate condos, is by far the largest project on the market in the neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past eight months, units are selling at a rate of 25 to 30 a month, according to Jeff Levine, a principal of Douglaston Development, the project's developer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rental market has fared slightly better, as average monthly rents for a one-bedroom have risen to just under $3,000 from about $2,100 in August 2009, according to MNS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A wave of new developers have made one concession to these chastened times. Many planned condo projects are going rental, in part because it's much easier to get construction financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the project underwent several reincarnations, construction is set to begin this fall on 250 North 10th St., a 234-unit rental purchased by LCOR. And 170 N. Fifth St., a 16-unit luxury rental purchased by Urban American LLC, will soon receive its certificate of occupancy. The Steelworks Lofts, once planned as a condo with fire pits and an outdoor cinema, was purchased in November by Cayuga Capital Management, along with Jacob Toll, son of home builder Robert Toll, who previously said they plan to convert it to rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 111 Kent Ave., another condo-to-rental project, the website went up a few weeks ago, and the broker says they received more than 300 inquiries on the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They are creative types, and also bankers and lawyers, who play in a band on Friday night" and boast a tattoo under their button-down shirts, said Dave Maundrell, president of aptsandlofts.com [http://www.aptsandlofts.com], which is marketing the project.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past few years, scaffolding and stop-work orders have been as common a sight on the streets of Williamsburg as popular new restaurants and bearded young hipsters. But in a dramatic turnaround, at least eight stalled residential developments are coming back to life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After more than three years of neighborhood battles, units at the notorious "Finger Building" on North Eighth Street will hit the market later this month, according to the developer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices at the newly finished 14-story building, now dubbed simply 144 N. Eighth St., will range from $550,000 for one-bedrooms to upward of $2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GFI Development Co., the company behind the Ace Hotels in New York and Palm Springs, bought the half-finished project in 2008 and redesigned it with features such as an 18,000-square-foot outdoor garden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building's original developer, Mendel Brach, planned a 16-story tower that elicited outrage from community groups, who said it stuck out above the neighboring low-rise buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project eventually stalled because of a dispute with an adjoining building over air rights, and Mr. Brach subsequently sold the loan. In 2009 Mr. Brach was barred by the state attorney general from sponsoring co-ops and condos after the office determined he took advantage of a faculty-housing exemption to build a nine-story condo in Bedford-Stuyvesant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as the "Finger Building" readies for its close-up, other previously stalled sites around the neighborhood are moving forward in a flurry of construction activity not seen in Williamsburg, or in many other neighborhoods in the city, since early 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others warn the optimism could be premature, saying construction financing for condo projects remains extremely tight, and the economy as a whole could be heading for another dip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices for land also have nearly doubled in the past year to 18 months, raising questions about whether developers who are buying now can make a return on that investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't think it's justified. The market is still waiting to stabilize," said Abraham Bennun of Triton Realty Group, the developer of a new condo and townhouse development at 197 Berry St. He bought the land in March 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He now plans to finish the project by April or May, with studios starting in the $300,000 range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a great time for buyers, Mr. Bennun said, but he cautioned developers: "The question for me is whether the market will continue to grow at the same pace as we've seen over the last 2 1/2 years."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2005, developers rushed to the neighborhood following the rezoning of North Williamsburg and Greenpoint. Dozens of run-down warehouses or empty lots were soon plastered with building permits. At the 2006 peak, there were nearly 50 new developments, all of them selling units at the same time, according to MNS Realty, which advises developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The neighborhood, once a poor and working-class enclave of Latinos and religious Jews, suffered a major blow during the recession, when condo prices dropped from a high of $800 a square foot to about $650 a square foot in 2009, according to MNS. They have since started to climb back up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financing for new condo projects became almost impossible to secure, and the neighborhood was soon littered with stalled sites. The media "almost declared it a disaster zone," said David Behin, a partner at MNS Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But developers insist that's led to a shortage of new inventory as the neighborhood has become flooded with not only artists and hipsters but young families and professionals from Manhattan looking to take advantage of its restaurants and lower prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand has risen sharply for units at the Edge, which, with 565 market-rate condos, is by far the largest project on the market in the neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past eight months, units are selling at a rate of 25 to 30 a month, according to Jeff Levine, a principal of Douglaston Development, the project's developer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rental market has fared slightly better, as average monthly rents for a one-bedroom have risen to just under $3,000 from about $2,100 in August 2009, according to MNS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A wave of new developers have made one concession to these chastened times. Many planned condo projects are going rental, in part because it's much easier to get construction financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the project underwent several reincarnations, construction is set to begin this fall on 250 North 10th St., a 234-unit rental purchased by LCOR. And 170 N. Fifth St., a 16-unit luxury rental purchased by Urban American LLC, will soon receive its certificate of occupancy. The Steelworks Lofts, once planned as a condo with fire pits and an outdoor cinema, was purchased in November by Cayuga Capital Management, along with Jacob Toll, son of home builder Robert Toll, who previously said they plan to convert it to rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 111 Kent Ave., another condo-to-rental project, the website went up a few weeks ago, and the broker says they received more than 300 inquiries on the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They are creative types, and also bankers and lawyers, who play in a band on Friday night" and boast a tattoo under their button-down shirts, said Dave Maundrell, president of aptsandlofts.com, which is marketing the project.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Factories around the world are throttling back, signaling a broadening of the slowdown in economic activity that is raising the specter of a double-dip recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturing in a large swath of Europe contracted for the first time in two years as downturns in Greece and Ireland threaten larger economies such as Italy and France.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S., a survey of purchasing managers showed the factory sector barely expanding in August as the job market struggles to pick up and businesses confront weakening sentiment. Asia's manufacturers also pulled back, with bellwethers such as South Korea and Taiwan contracting while China's factory expansion stalled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The manufacturing reports show how slowdowns in different parts of the world are feeding off one another. Asia's fast-growing economies, for instance, are confronting weakness in the advanced economies that are big buyers of their exports. Likewise, companies in the U.S. and other advanced economies rely on growth in the emerging economies to offset weakness at home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the euro zone, manufacturing fell back into contraction territory, ending a nearly two-year run of growth as activity shrank in France and Italy. U.K. factory output fell to the weakest level for more than two years in August, with production falling for the first time since May 2009. The manufacturing purchasing managers' index for the euro zone fell to 49 in August from 50.4 in July, dropping below the key 50 threshold denoting expansion, Markit Economics said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Nixon, an economist at <span class="companylink">Societe Generale</span>, said the "fairly grim picture of activity" shown by the PMIs was consistent with a slowdown in euro-zone economic growth to just 0.1% in the third quarter from the second, following 0.2% growth between April and June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Williamson, an economist at financial-information firm Markit, noted a particularly sharp fall in German new orders for export, a key contributor to growth in that country. "The euro zone can no longer rely on export-led growth in its largest member state to help sustain even a lackluster recovery for the region as a whole," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.K., the manufacturing purchasing managers' index fell to a 26-month low of 49 from a revised 49.4 in July, according to Markit and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result was stronger than the estimate of 48.5 from a survey of economists, but another reading below 50 indicates the sector has shrunk for a second straight month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The near-stalling of the world's manufacturing expansion comes at a precarious time. The slowdown could exacerbate debt worries in both Europe and the U.S. and sap energy from Asia, which has provided the bulk of global growth in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also raises the stakes for policy makers addressing fiscal concerns this fall in Europe and the U.S., and for emerging-market officials who have spent much of the year grappling with rising inflation and overheating economies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key index of U.S. manufacturing activity from the Institute for Supply Management, a group of purchasing executives, edged down a third of a percentage point to 50.6, just above the 50 threshold indicating expansion in the sector. An index of production contracted to the lowest point since May 2009, while new orders indicated a somewhat slower contraction than in the prior month. While prices continued to ease, the expansion in employment also slowed as businesses confronted a darkening climate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The general tone is one of concern over which direction the economy is going," says Bradley Holcomb, chair of the ISM's manufacturing survey. "Companies are willing to fill critical positions that become vacant but this is not going to translate into significant hiring at this point."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. employers don't yet appear to be shedding workers at a faster pace. The Labor Department said Thursday that initial filings for jobless claims last week fell 12,000 to 409,000 as the effects of a Verizon workers strike earlier in the month diminished. Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said construction spending in July dropped 1.3% from June, with an even sharper decline in public-sector projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the slower growth in Asia comes as inflation remains elevated across much of the continent, posing a dilemma for policy makers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in China, which powered the world economy through the global financial crisis in 2008, Thursday's data weren't encouraging. The official PMI rose slightly, to 50.9 in August from 50.7 in July, but a similar gauge from <span class="companylink">HSBC</span> remained in contraction territory at 49.9, up from July's 49.3.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Helen and Bob Alkon paid $1.3 million for their condominium in downtown Boston two years ago. And while some apartments in the building have slipped in value since then, one of the Alkons' investments has paid off: The parking spot they purchased for $100,000 today sells for $125,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm glad I bought when I did," says Ms. Alkon, a retired office manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some downtowns across the country, a scarcity of parking has driven demand into the stratosphere -- even in places where home prices are declining. In some buildings, parking costs are nearly on par, on a per-square-foot basis, with the apartments themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parking comes at a premium in places where crowded conditions and urban revitalization efforts have fueled demand. Residential buildings typically allocate one or fewer parking spots per unit. While these are sold only to residents, some parking spaces on lower floors are leased to non-residents as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building more parking garages isn't necessarily an option. In Manhattan's business core, for example, constructing a public garage requires a special permit that is expensive and time-consuming to obtain. Separately, city planning officials may lower minimum parking requirements at residential buildings that have good access to mass transit, exacerbating the squeeze.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's kind of just a wasted requirement to have them put parking in," because residents are much more likely to take a subway or a bus, says Hope Cohen, associate director of the New York-based nonprofit Regional Plan Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As prices rise, some luxury-condo owners have purchased parking spots as investments. Diane Sarkisian, a real-estate agent and concert pianist, bought a condo in Symphony House, a high-end building in Center City Philadelphia, for $1.05 million, or about $783 per square foot, in 2007. She also bought two parking spots, at $50,000 apiece -- or about $278 per square foot -- to house her Mercedes S550 and her daughter's Volvo S40. While the value of her apartment hasn't appreciated, the going rate for parking spots in the building has risen to $75,000, about $416 per square foot. It offers a good return to owners when developers allow them to sublet their spaces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My apartment is probably not quite worth what it was," Ms. Sarkisian says. "I think it's going to retain its value pretty well, but not as well as my parking spot. I'm a parking profiteer."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In cities like Philadelphia, parking prices are also influenced by the availability of parking at surrounding offices, schools, shops and restaurants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The beauty of it is, as [apartment] prices came down, parking went up," says Jon Gollinger, a condo broker and real-estate consultant with Accelerated Marketing Partners in Boston. He adds that in every city he works in, he is noticing parking rates rising for buildings with desirable locations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You're dealing with the elite," he says. "Someone who has money and is willing to spend a million, million and a half on a unit, you're not going to park your car in a building that's half a block away. That's just not going to happen."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toronto's exclusive Four Seasons residence building recently set a local record by selling a suite in a 55-story tower for $28 million. Prices for parking spaces also broke a record, coming in at $100,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The city has been on a very healthy run in the last decade, and people have really taken a shine to living in condos." says Mimi Ng, a spokeswoman for Menkes Developments Ltd., the project's developer. "If you're spending $4 million for a suite here, $100,000 isn't out of line for parking."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other cities, local policy makers say costly parking spots encourage the use of public transit, which in turn reduces downtown traffic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Francisco, for example, in 2006 required that developers unbundle parking-spot prices from the prices of condos. Now, the two properties have to be purchased separately, so buyers are more likely to take public transit to work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A more recent ordinance limits the number of parking spaces in certain high-density parts of the city, to 0.5 parking space for each condo unit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, in-building parking prices over the past year have climbed above $100,000 for the first time, says Alan Mark, a real-estate consultant in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some extreme cases, out-of-the ordinary parking features have actually driven up prices on condos. A building in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood designed by star architect Annabelle Selldorf that opened this year and has sold units to celebrities like actress Nicole Kidman and fashion designer Domenico Dolce, features an "En Suite Sky Garage" -- an elevator that brings your car right to your apartment. Units in the building have sold for as much as $6 million apiece. Residents drive their cars into an elevator inside the building, which delivers both car and driver to a spot adjacent to their condo unit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's something I've seen in New York and Washington and Miami: That the upper tier is just doing better because it's not hampered by financing," says Jonathan Miller, a real-estate appraiser and consultant in New York. "That's where you'll see this propensity for luxury stuff, and parking is one of those key things."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Eliot Brown   </div><div>610 words</div><div>31 August 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a time when the U.S. banking sector is reducing its exposure to commercial real estate, <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo &amp; Co</span>. has taken a different approach: expanding lending to the sector while also buying real-estate loans from other banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> reached a deal to buy $3.3 billion in loans tied to U.S. commercial properties from Anglo Irish Bank Corp., according to people familiar with the matter. <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> declined to comment on the deal. That followed the bank's purchase of about $1.4 billion in U.S. loan holdings from <span class="companylink">Bank of Ireland</span> earlier this month and about $500 million in loans the bank bought from <span class="companylink">Allied Irish Banks PLC</span> this spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Irish banks have been the most active sellers of commercial property loans lately, as the country's banking sector seeks to raise cash from foreign investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loan purchases speak to how some large, healthier U.S. banks have been taking a shine to commercial real estate, turning to the sector as a source of revenue at a time when they are flush with cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co</span>. last week reached a deal with Anglo Irish to buy a portfolio of about $1.2 billion in loans tied to U.S. properties. The firm, which has stepped up its commercial property lending as well, bought a $3.5 billion portfolio of predominantly multifamily performing loans from <span class="companylink">Citigroup Inc</span>. last summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even before the latest deals, <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> had emerged as the leading holder of commercial mortgages among banks, according to Trepp LLC, which tracks commercial property lending. During the second quarter, <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>'s loan holdings grew by $3.3 billion, bringing its total to $100.2 billion, according to Trepp. The data exclude construction loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We like the risk-return of the business," said David Hoyt, who heads wholesale banking for <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The amount of commercial property loans held by the next five largest commercial real-estate lenders after <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> decreased by $1.3 billion, according to Trepp. While many of these banks are making new commercial real-estate loans, old loans have been maturing or have been sold off at a faster pace than new loans have been made.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> has been far more aggressive than other banks, partly because it was less wounded by commercial real estate than many competitors, some of which virtually shut down lending in the sector through much of the downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>'s increased attention to commercial real estate could prove a risky bet as fears grow about a second recession. Values for commercial property are closely tied to economic fundamentals such as employment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If job growth remains sluggish, commercial mortgage defaults could rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market for commercial mortgage-backed securities, which are created when banks pool mortgage loans and sell them to investors, has already been hit hard by volatility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loan portfolios targeted by <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>, as well as <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span>, have been performing loans considered less likely to run into trouble than many loans made during the peak. The purchases essentially are a quick way to build up their mortgage portfolios.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Particularly at a time when loan demand is weak across the industry, buying pools of loans is a good way to put excess liquidity to work," said Joe Morford, an analyst at <span class="companylink">RBC Capital Markets</span> who covers <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>.</p>

</div><div class="author">By S. Mitra Kalita   </div><div>611 words</div><div>31 August 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices increased in the second quarter but fell compared with the same period last year, painting a mixed picture of the real-estate market amid plummeting consumer confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index, released Tuesday, rose 3.6% for the quarter ended in June, but fell 5.9% annually, sending prices back to pre-boom 2003 levels. Consumer confidence, meanwhile, sank to its lowest level in two years, according to the Conference Board, a private research group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Confidence fell to a reading of 44.5 in August from 59.2 in July. That is its lowest level since April 2009 and much worse than most economists had expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Coming in the wake of a rancorous debate over the debt ceiling and the downgrade of U.S. debt, such a drop in confidence could hardly be much of a surprise," Nomura's chief U.S. economist David Resler wrote in a note to clients. "Nonetheless, declines in confidence run the risk of becoming self-fulfilling if they affect buying intentions."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest indicators also don't account for Hurricane Irene, which caused flooding and other damage in the East over the weekend. Total Mortgage, a lender in Milford, Conn., has begun asking borrowers in affected areas for an affidavit pledging that their home values and conditions remain the same as the initial appraisal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes in areas seeking funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency likely will have to undergo an additional inspection before closing, said Total Mortgage President John Walsh. While the numbers of affected buyers and sellers might be small, he says an already-shaky housing market can't handle much more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Any impact is a large impact," Mr. Walsh said. "We have a situation where people are going to be focusing on repairing their homes, and that might make people nervous about buying a home along the coast."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing gauge showed prices generally rose in its 20-city index. Minneapolis and Chicago led gains, both at 3.2%, while prices in Portland, Ore., remained flat. But across the board, prices were down from a year ago. Minneapolis posted the steepest annual decline, at 10.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the price increases remain good news in an industry that has had little to cheer. "The pace of sales is better than a year ago," said Vance Shutes, an associate broker for Real Estate One's Ann Arbor, Mich., office. "In our northern suburbs, where the automotive companies were just decimated, those markets are now rebounding strongly as the auto companies have started bringing people back after five years of shedding them."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, one bright spot of the consumer-confidence report was that the percentage of people who intend to buy a car or a major appliance edged higher. Yet far fewer respondents said they plan to buy a house in the next six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One economist, citing uncertainty in the labor and stock markets, called Tuesday's housing data, which reflect prices only until June, the "last hurrah" before prices begin to slide. The National Association of Realtors reported this week that pending home sales—which measure the number of contracts to buy previously owned homes—fell 1.3% after two months of gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The real concern is what's going to happen in July and August," said Stan Humphries, chief economist at real-estate firm <span class="companylink">Zillow Inc</span>. "Consumers have been getting a lot of bad data points about the economy and that is going to get translated into the housing market."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer spending posted strong gains in July despite weak income growth, the latest sign the economy gained some momentum at the start of the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But data released Tuesday suggested consumers' mood darkened as summer wore on, perhaps as a consequence of the debt-ceiling debate in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conference Board, a private research group, said its index of consumer confidence dropped to 44.5 in August, from a revised 59.2 in July, first reported as 59.5.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The August reading is the lowest since April 2009 and was far worse than the 52.0 expected by economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A day earlier, the Commerce Department reported that consumption rose 0.8% in July, following a slight contraction in June. Adjusted for inflation, spending rose a healthy 0.5% -- the strongest gain since December 2009 -- after two flat months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest figures suggest the economy regained some strength at the start of the third quarter after extremely weak growth in the first half of the year. The numbers could help dispel fears that the economy was heading back into a recession this summer. Gasoline prices are already down about 10% since the spring, a drop that could provide more support for spending on other goods and services into the fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At the moment, the economy is back on its feet after the temporary soft patch caused by $4 gasoline earlier this year," said Chris Rupkey, a U.S. economist at <span class="companylink">Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy still faces substantial risks. Deeply depressed consumer sentiment -- tied in part to the market turmoil and the contentious debt debate in Washington -- could lead consumers to rein in their spending. An increase in auto-sector sales, following a spring slowdown, could prove to be only a temporary lift for the overall economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board Consumer Research Center, said a contributing factor to the August downturn in consumers' outlook "may have been the debt-ceiling discussions since the decline in confidence was well under way before the S&amp;P downgrade" of U.S. Treasury debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent surveys suggesting a sharp slowdown in manufacturing activity during August have renewed worries about a new downturn in the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the latest survey, the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas</span> on Monday said its gauge of general business activity moved deeper into negative territory this month, indicating a sharper pullback among manufacturers in the region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a separate gauge of companies' outlook was less positive than it was in July, the Dallas Fed said "the great majority of respondents said their outlooks were unchanged or improved from last month."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers boosted their spending in July in part by saving less. The personal saving rate fell to 5% from 5.5%. Overall personal income rose 0.3% during the month, but it failed to keep up with inflation and taxes. Inflation-adjusted income after taxes fell 0.1% in the first decline since September. Incomes will need to pick up -- through improvement in the labor market -- to maintain strength in consumer spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Income gains are highly correlated with job growth so unless job creation accelerates, income growth will continue to be sluggish," said Steven Wood, chief economist at Insight Economics.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the many New Jersey communities near the Hudson River that experienced a housing boom during the last decade, Union City was an obvious candidate for development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has easy access to Manhattan, spectacular views of the skyline from its cliffs and an abundance of little-used industrial spaces that could be transformed into condominiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers erected several new condo towers in the area—which traditionally had been characterized by single- and multifamily homes—and also put up some larger apartment buildings. Union City began replicating some of the success of Hoboken, its neighbor to the south, by drawing more young couples who were attracted to the Union City's urban feel and proximity to New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then the financial crisis hit "and stalled the momentum that Union City had in becoming the new Hoboken," Gene Vazquez, a developer with Austral Construction. Buyers since then have started to come back, albeit not at the rate of a few years ago, he said. "We are going to be back on track once things straighten out."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Union City is a tiny city measuring just over one square mile with about 66,000 residents, making it the most densely populated city in the country, according to the latest U.S. Census.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the 1950s and 1960s, an influx of Cubans searching for work in Union City's embroidery factories settled in the area. To this day, Union City has a large Cuban population that includes the owners of many of the shops and restaurants along Bergenline Avenue, one of the main drags in the city. More recent Latin immigrants from Mexico and Ecuador have also begun to populate the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residents from other parts of New Jersey and Manhattanites have been moving into the city as well, brokers say. "We are getting a lot of people from New York who at first are a little hesitant, who say they are never moving to New Jersey," said Greg Taylor of Liberty Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate professionals credit a five-year tax-abatement program offered by Union City in spurring developers to build condos and for luring prospective home buyers. Under the program, the buyer of a new $325,000 condo would save roughly $21,000, Mr. Taylor said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it lacks the popularity of Hoboken and the taller condo towers of Jersey City, Union City often offers more room and amenities at a lower cost. The median asking price for Union City homes is $325,000, or $304 a square foot, according to real-estate site StreetEasy. In Hoboken, it is $503 a square foot, and in Jersey City, it is $370, according to StreetEasy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the newest developments in the city is Union Square, a six-story, 40-unit development on 38th Street built by Austral Construction, where sales began this month. The entire building is Energy Star certified, the only of its kind in Union City, Mr. Vazquez said. It has a gym, indoor garage and a virtual doorman. Prices range from $299,000 to $478,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Lenox on Central Avenue is one of the larger condominiums in the city with 16 floors and 300 units. It was previously a rental building and was converted and renovated in 2007. About a third of the units have been sold, said Mr. Taylor of Liberty Realty. It has a gym, concierge service and a shuttle to the Hoboken Path Train. Prices range from $150,000 to $300,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another new development in the area is the Hudson View on Park Avenue, a 64-unit building that launched sales in 2008. The units have hardwood floors, granite countertops and oak wood kitchen cabinets. Most of the units have been sold but asking prices on the remaining units range from $269,000 to $419,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parks: There are a few small parks in Union City with ballparks, including Washington Park and Jose Marti Field. The city has several playground, including Elsworth Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Schools: The Union City Board of Education runs the schools in the city. They includes Union City High School, Emerson Middle School and Union Hill Middle School.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to state data, 63.2% of middle-school students were proficient or advanced in language arts in the 2009-10 school year, compared with 67.7% the previous year. In math, 74.4% of fourth-graders were proficient or advanced, compared with 71.3% the year before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the high-school level, 82.5% of students were proficient or advanced in language arts, compared with 76.1% in 2009; and 69.3% in math in 2010 and 68.9% in 2009. In 2010, 97.9% of students graduated from high school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private schools in the neighborhood include St. Augustine's School and St. Francis Academy, both running from nursery through middle school. St. Joseph of the Palisades Elementary School is in nearby West New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Restaurants: Union City is filled with many Latin-inspired restaurants. Pan Con Todo is a popular Cuban eatery, and Charrito's serves Mexican food. Park Avenue Bar and Grill has an American and Latin menu with lots of outdoor space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shopping: Bergenline Avenue is one of the city's main thoroughfares and has the basic staples like hardware stores, banks and pharmacies. Big-box retailers such as Sam's Club and <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span> are a short drive away in Secaucus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Entertainment: The Park Performing Arts Center, with its concerts and performances, has been operating in Union City for decades. Also in the area is Union City Performing Arts Center, which has performances, films and concerts.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Toll Brothers Inc</span>.'s fiscal third-quarter earnings jumped 54% with a boost from a bigger tax benefit, but the luxury home builder saw a double-digit drop in revenue as home deliveries fell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company, which caters largely to affluent move-up buyers in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, is considered one of the sector's best performers and analysts watch its performance closely. Toll saw cancellations increase and orders climb modestly, raising red flags.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm not liking what I'm seeing," Demir Gjokaj, a senior analyst with ITG Investment Research. "If Toll is getting weak, and they've always been located in the strongest regions and have the strongest buyer segments, it definitely casts a shadow on the rest of the group coming into the third quarter."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> shares rose 4.6% to finish at $15.42, up 68 cents on the New York Stock Exchange at 4 p.m. on Wednesday amid a rally on Wall Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders, which have spent five years battling the worst downturn in generations, are growing increasingly concerned that recent financial volatility could deliver the fragile sector another blow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An industry group said Wednesday that U.S. home mortgage applications for purchases fell to a nearly 15-year low last week as resurgent worries about the strength of the economy kept buyers at bay. The Mortgage Bankers Association said its seasonally adjusted index of mortgage application activity, which includes both refinancing and home purchase demand, fell 2.4% in the week ended Aug. 1. On Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported that new home sales fell in July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 298,000, the lowest point since February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Toll said it is too early to gauge the effect of recent events on housing, it did say they weren't doing much to soothe jittery consumers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While late summer is generally not the best time to sell homes, in the short run, the stock market gyrations, the budget impasse and the U.S. government bond rating downgrade are certainly not helping consumer confidence," Chief Executive Douglas C. Yearley Jr. said in the premarket release.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the quarter ended July 31, <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> reported a profit of $42.1 million, or 25 cents a share, up from $27.3 million, or 16 cents a share, a year earlier. The results included a tax benefit of $38.2 million, up from $26.5 million a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue slumped 13% to $394.3 million. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected earnings of three cents a share on $404 million in revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gross margin slipped to 13.8% from 14.2% a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll delivered 693 homes, a 14% decrease from a year earlier. The average price of net signed contracts was $570,000, roughly unchanged from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cancellation rate, defined as cancellations divided by signed contracts, was 7.4%, up from 6.2% a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contracts climbed 2% from the prior year, missing some analyst estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll narrowed its fiscal year delivery range to 2,475-to-2,675 homes, from the 2,300-to-2,800 it previously expected. For the fourth quarter, it expects between 620 and 820 deliveries.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nicole Gelinas   </div><div>4127 words</div><div>25 August 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the City Journal</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the American economy limps through its second "recovery summer," hobbled by trillions of dollars in bubble-era debt, politicians and regulators should take a long look at an unlikely place: Kingsbridge, a neighborhood in the northwest Bronx. In some ways, Kingsbridge's credit-bubble experience was no different from the rest of the nation's. As the bubble reached its greatest size in late 2006 and early 2007, the financial system—aided by dizzyingly intricate instruments and coddled by the government, which had long kept investors from facing the consequences of bad decisions—piled too much debt on Kingsbridge's modest dwellings. As a result, the buildings' owner abandoned them, leaving tenants to bear the brunt of somebody else's mistakes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet Kingsbridge has also become a startling exception to what's happening in the rest of the country. A few people, acting within New York's regulation-strangled rental real-estate market, have produced a solution that harnesses the power of the marketplace to correct mistakes. They've pulled this off even as most of the country languishes in government-bailout purgatory. Washington should heed the lesson of Kingsbridge. If it doesn't, we're likely to spend another half-decade haunted by the bad debt of the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kingsbridge, a mostly black and Hispanic hardscrabble neighborhood, is different from Las Vegas, Miami, and other go-go symbols of the mid-2000s credit bubble. Sergio Cuevas, an accountant at the nearby Albert Einstein College of Medicine, has lived in Kingsbridge for nearly three decades, in a brightly cluttered, rent-regulated two-bedroom apartment that he has shared with his two children since their mother died. "The baby got shot right over there," he says, gesturing out the window to the spot where a stray bullet wounded a three-year-old girl his mother was babysitting in 1993. Shootings are less frequent now, and the crime rate in general is lower. But this is still the northwest Bronx, nearly an hour from midtown Manhattan by subway. The median household income is just $29,000, and according to NYU's Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy, nearly a third of Kingsbridge's households earn under $19,000 a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five years ago, though, a California-based real-estate firm called Milbank announced that this humble reality represented instant opportunity. Calling the Bronx "one of the last boroughs to offer affordable rent, which would also be positioned to undergo significant gentrification," the company decided to buy properties, mostly in Kingsbridge, and transform them into luxury buildings, which would allow for "an improved tenant base and increased rental income." So Milbank plunked down $42.4 million for 551 apartment units in ten apartment buildings, including Cuevas's building on Sedgwick Avenue. That was about seven times the buildings' estimated "rent roll," or annual gross rental income. Paying even five times a building's rent roll is aggressive, say Bronx real-estate veterans (Milbank didn't respond to an interview request).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That excessive $42.4 million was just the start of Milbank's investment. To upgrade the buildings to luxury status, as its plan dictated, the company would have to spend a lot more money. An electrical overhaul would be necessary, for starters, since the residences' aging electrical infrastructure made it difficult for apartment dwellers to use two appliances at once without blowing a fuse, and many outlets didn't even work. Milbank would also need to fix leaking roofs and replace plumbing and heating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All told, the upgrades would cost tens of millions of dollars, making Milbank's total investment in the buildings far higher than its rental income would cover. That should have been especially troubling because the other part of Milbank's plan—boosting rents with an "improved tenant base"—ignored an immutable fact of New York real estate: replacing lower-paying tenants with higher-paying ones isn't easy. New York law constrains annual rent increases. If landlords make major capital improvements, they can pass those costs along to their tenants, but they must do so over several years, not all at once. Yes, owners can raise the rent more for vacant apartments than for occupied units, but they must renew existing tenants' leases if the tenants want to stay on, so turnover is low. Owners can evict tenants who have illegally sublet their apartments or who lag on the rent, but removals can take years and are fraught with public-relations risks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it's not just the law that curbs rents. Even if Milbank succeeded in ejecting tenants and hiking rents, it still would have to compete for wealthier residents with neighborhoods nearer Manhattan. Affluent families, especially those with young children, would be nervous in a neighborhood like Kingsbridge, with its menacing pit bulls and loitering toughs. Younger singles would prefer to be nearer Manhattan's nightlife. A quick stroll around Kingsbridge and cursory knowledge of the New York real-estate market would have made these realities clear and suggested to Milbank that it was paying way too much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To understand why a company would be so feckless—and why investors would throw money at it—you have to know something about the 2006 securitization bubble and a quarter-century's worth of government financial policy. Since the early 1980s, Washington had made it clear that if investors lent money to a financial institution that was sufficiently big or complex, the government would bail them out in a crisis. The government, in effect, subsidized the financial industry—and, not surprisingly, got more of it, including its main product: debt. Finance used this unfair advantage over other industries to grow ever bigger and more complex (see " 'Too Big to Fail' Must Die," Summer 2009).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Washington and other Western governments also counseled (and sometimes required) big investors, such as mutual funds and money-market funds, to select debt investments that carried AAA ratings, which supposedly denoted safety. To meet this demand, financial firms went to great lengths to transform junky debt into AAA-rated debt. In many cases, they accomplished this alchemy by purchasing loans from mortgage lenders and brokers, pooling these individually risky loans, and selling securities, backed by the entire pool, to investors. Because some investors in the pool agreed to take on more risk for a higher return—that is, they agreed to shoulder the bulk of any hypothetical losses—other investors in the pool could take less risk. That's how risky loans became securities carrying AAA ratings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So it happened that in late 2006 and 2007, <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> and <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> created a $3.7 billion pool made up of "commercial mortgage-backed securities." The pool was a mix of 172 debtors, according to the trust's 500-page informational document. It included a $340 million loan against the Mall of America, a $240 million loan against the former Enron building in Houston, and smaller loans against everything from mini-storage facilities to RV parks across the country. It included, too, $35 million worth of mortgages against Milbank's Bronx properties (Milbank also borrowed another $3 million in junior debt separately from <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>). Having won AAA ratings on $3.4 billion of the pool, the underwriters sold the securities off to investors, which eventually included mutual and insurance funds managed by such firms as <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>, <span class="companylink">Putnam Investments</span>, Prudential, and <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>. At least one of these investors added another layer of complexity by purchasing "insurance" on its supposedly supersafe investment via a credit-default swap. Adding yet more opacity, <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> separately transferred Milbank's junior debt to another trust, which <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> kept on its own books.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can start to see why investors would trust Milbank with their money. After all, they were so far removed from the facts of the deal that they might as well have been on another planet. No wonder they lent freely to a Los Angeles–based company with zero experience in the Bronx, at a time when the real-estate bubble was already bursting and commentators were warning of disaster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To spend a day with people who actually know the Bronx real-estate business is to realize just how crazy the financial markets were in 2006. Matt Engel, whose family has managed rent-regulated Bronx buildings for decades, remembers one bubble-era real-estate prospector who created a multi-tab spreadsheet featuring complex, long-term projections of everything from regional personal income to oil prices. Landlords who know the business don't rely on such soothsaying, Engel observes. Instead, they often consult a single piece of paper that shows the year's rent roll; expected losses from tenants who don't pay; and rough estimates of big-ticket items, such as heating oil, water, and taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The piece of paper also, of course, shows mortgage costs. Conservative-minded landlords, Engel explains, know not to borrow so much that they lack the cash to cover emergencies. Many refuse to borrow more than 60 percent of a property's value, even though lenders are willing to offer much more. (Milbank borrowed 90 percent of the funds for its Kingsbridge purchase.) Even a small change in petroleum prices can cost tens of thousands of dollars per building in heating, Engel says; if you've borrowed too heavily, you may not be able to make your mortgage payment when petroleum spikes or when you have to make an emergency repair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Veteran landlords also have at their disposal a trove of information that wasn't available to the bubble-era securities underwriters, ratings analysts, lawyers, servicers, and consultants—even those toting complicated spreadsheets. These landlords know which tenants run into money trouble every few months but always pay the rent in the end, and which won't send in their back rent until faced with eviction. They know which tenants disable smoke detectors and remove child-safety guards from windows. They even know which tenants smoke carelessly. Landlords can delegate their work effectively—provided the third party knows that the owner is looking over his shoulder and understands the business. An elderly Bronx property owner can retire to Florida and pay a manager to handle his buildings, say, but only because he knows enough to be suspicious of any big change in income and outflow. The mutual-fund and insurance-fund investors whose money eventually found its way into Milbank's hands had no such knowledge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engel remembers the credit boom well. "There was all this money, institutional money, coming in," he says. Those investors who actually understood Bronx real estate looked on dubiously as the bubble got bigger and bigger. "People who know the Bronx haven't bought in ten years," says one Bronx property owner who prefers not to be named. As the Milbanks of the world came calling, many small landlords sold out, knowing that they wouldn't see these prices again in their lifetimes. "It was time to get out of the business," one owner recalls with a chuckle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Belatedly, Milbank figured that out, too. In February 2009, two years after consummating its investment, the company realized that its business plan would never work; among other things, turnover among tenants was far lower than it had hoped. So Milbank walked away, deciding "not to throw good money after bad," said one person familiar with the company's thinking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the paperwork required, the trust that managed the debt for the ultimate investors—those mutual-fund holders, banks, and other institutions—transferred the Milbank "portfolio" to a "special servicer," a company called LNR Partners. The process looked straightforward. LNR would go to court to foreclose on the buildings, at a stroke wiping out much of the debt that Milbank had taken on. LNR would then sell the buildings to a new buyer—one who knew the business better—at a lower price. Investors in the mortgage trust would take big losses; <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>, which still held the junior debt, would lose everything. And everyone—investors new and old, as well as tenants and neighbors—would get on with their lives. In an efficient marketplace, that would have been that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LNR's actions in early 2009 followed the script. In March, it went to Bronx Supreme Court to start foreclosure. It asked for and got a court-appointed receiver—someone to collect rents and maintain the properties while they were in legal limbo. Everything seemed on track. But then LNR began to stall. The company repeatedly asked the Bronx judge, Stanley Green, to stay foreclosure. As the months passed and became a year, the ten buildings deteriorated. With effectively no owner, more than 3,300 housing-code violations went uncorrected. Tenants with means went elsewhere, leaving more than 100 units vacant across the portfolio. Meanwhile, the court-appointed receiver couldn't come up with the money for even elementary repairs. Some tenants stopped paying rent, while others sent more than $90,000 in rent to the wrong place—to Milbank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why the delay? LNR's reason for stalling was probably that foreclosure meant realizing a certain loss, whereas if the firm waited, it could hold out the hope of selling for a higher price later (the company didn't respond to an interview request). It had another incentive, too: investors in the trust could sue LNR if they thought that it hadn't done everything possible to get the best price. Plus, if <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> and <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> thought that LNR was foreclosing too quickly and disposing of real estate at fire-sale prices, they might not recommend the special servicer for future jobs. <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> would be doubly annoyed because the junior debt that it held would be rendered worthless if the senior debt suffered even small losses, as it likely would via foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But why wouldn't the managers of the funds that bought the securities want their customers to take their inevitable losses and get them over with? The answer involves the way <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> and <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> had created their pool of debt. Remember how $3.4 billion of the pool was AAA-rated? To this day, $2.5 billion of it still carries AAA ratings, and investors in that debt continue to receive their regular income because investors in the riskier "tranches," as they're called, have suffered all the losses as the performance of the underlying loans has disintegrated. But once the losses in a pool reach a certain point, even the AAA debt is affected and suffers ratings downgrades. The fund managers who hold AAA debt don't want that to happen, for obvious reasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LNR's policy of "extending and pretending," to borrow Wall Street's parlance, was encouraged, too, by the federal government. By keeping its key interest rate at zero percent, for instance, the Federal Reserve allowed the Milbank investors to keep borrowing cheaply and thus keep holding their bad debt. But the Fed went much further in discouraging a market solution for Kingsbridge. In autumn 2008, in a misguided attempt to keep the prices of mortgage-backed securities inflated, it started a program called TALF, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, through which it would lend cheaply to financial firms that offered those securities as collateral. In 2009, a financial firm called DMR TALF and ABS Funding LLC took the Fed up on this deal, offering its holdings of Milbank-related debt securities in exchange for a nearly $30 million loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This mechanism is forbiddingly obscure. But the result is easy to grasp: it helped everyone involved in the bad Kingsbridge debt hang on to it as long as possible. Meanwhile, the Bronx buildings kept deteriorating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than two years would pass before the investors in the Milbank deal finally took their losses so that everyone could move on. In April 2011, Milbank sold the buildings to a new landlord at a price more than 25 percent lower than its original 2006 purchase price. Counting liens, fines, and the like to close out the sale, Milbank's senior lenders probably lost about 26 percent of their original investment, observers estimate. <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> got nothing on its junior debt (except for its original underwriting fees).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It turns out, though, that the Milbank investors didn't take their losses entirely of their own volition. They did so because Kingsbridge residents organized themselves—a venerable New York tradition—and sought political and legal help. In early 2010, a legal-aid group called Legal Services NYC---Bronx took up the tenants' cause, arguing in Bronx Supreme Court that since the court-appointed receiver lacked the money for maintenance and repairs, the servicer, LNR, should have to pay up. When Judge Green agreed, ordering LNR to fork over $2.5 million, the investment equation for Milbank's investors suddenly changed. Waiting and letting physical assets deteriorate no longer promised the hope of full repayment but instead could cost money—and there was no guarantee that the payout would stop at $2.5 million. At the same time that Legal Services NYC—Bronx was going to court, two more nonprofits, the Urban Homesteading Assistance Board and the Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition, commissioned an architectural study that concluded that the buildings needed up to $25 million in repairs. Milbank's investors had to worry that a judge might order them to pay it all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The investors had to keep an eye on New York City's government, too. New York has a long history of efficiently dispatching owner-abandoned properties. Back in 1986, the city owned 4,000 occupied apartment buildings and almost 6,000 vacant ones, the legacy of the high crime rates and white flight of the sixties, seventies, and early eighties. Gotham has worked relentlessly to put these buildings into private hands, and today it controls far fewer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late 2010 and early 2011, the city was showing signs of seizing the Kingsbridge buildings. New York subpoenaed LNR to learn more about the properties' finances, and Mayor Michael Bloomberg, City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, and other officials pointedly toured the properties and announced a new program to deal with buildings whose indebted owners had abandoned them. It didn't hurt that a key staffer for Bronx borough president Ruben Diaz, Jr., lived in one of the buildings. Suddenly, cutting losses seemed the rational thing to do. <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> went so far as to transfer its $3 million in junior debt to the city for a dollar, washing its hands of the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York has hardly become a free-market paradise for real estate, however. As many as 100,000 apartments remain in debt-laden limbo. In April, a 12-year-old boy and his parents died in a fire in a three-story rental in the Bronx. They had been able to remain in their illegal apartment, which violated city fire codes, in part because their landlord had abandoned the property after taking on more debt than he could afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new owner of what are now known as the "Milbank buildings" is Steve Finkelstein, whose company has owned and managed rent-regulated properties in the Bronx for 40 years. He has already begun replacing windows and has promised the city to close out serious housing violations within a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finkelstein is taking a risk, but it's a measured one, and he has years of experience to back up his purchase. He bought the buildings for $31 million and figures that he can do the necessary repair work for about $11 million more. He reasons that new tenants will be willing to pay in the high three digits and low four digits a month for renovated, vacant apartments—well within the range allowed by New York's rent regulations. Finkelstein figures that his purchase price will work out to about five times the rent rolls, not nine, as was the case with Milbank. Over many years, he thinks, the buildings will yield an annual profit of $800,000 to $1 million. "At $31 million, these work as rentals," he says. Milbank, by contrast, "was buried."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finkelstein's deal illustrates that debt is fine, but in moderation, and only when lender and borrower alike know what they're doing and are accountable for the risks that they're taking. Finkelstein is borrowing about $30 million for his purchase—but he's borrowing not from an anonymous trust that is the agent of an agent of an agent of some investors, but from a bank that understands the rental market, is taking a calculated risk, and will hold its investment until it matures. Finkelstein's lender, Signature Bank, knows what to look for in such a transaction, says George Klett, who runs Signature's commercial real-estate lending shop. "Finkelstein is a very good client of the bank," says Klett. "You do repeat business, you bet on the jockey." Still, the bank's knowledge of the neighborhood, the properties, and the competition means that it's charging Finkelstein a comparatively high 6 percent interest rate on his loan. "Since the property is in poor physical condition and is in need of substantial repairs, we deem it to be additional risk," Klett says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some Bronx veterans still consider property valuations too high. In fact, some of Finkelstein's fellow landlords think that he is paying too much. But if that's the case—if it turns out that Finkelstein, like Milbank, isn't able to pay his debts—the results should be far simpler than they were after Milbank threw up its hands: either an ordinary foreclosure, a negotiation with his lender, or a prompt sale to another landlord.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rest of the country looks a lot like Milbank in early 2010: rotting while investors play pretend. Between 2000 and 2007, Americans borrowed more money more quickly than ever before, mostly by using their single-family homes as ATMs. Mortgage debt exploded, from $4.8 trillion to $10.6 trillion; today, it still stands at a staggering $10 trillion. At least a quarter of American home borrowers owe more than their houses are worth; millions more are close to that line and grow closer as property values continue their slow descent; so many are delinquent on their mortgages that in Florida, for example, the New York Times estimates that completing all eligible foreclosures would take a decade. All this debt is kneecapping the economy. Americans are using their money to pay for bubble-era mistakes, rather than investing in companies that create jobs, saving money for their children's education, or putting away funds for their own retirement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as LNR should have foreclosed promptly on the Kingsbridge buildings, financial firms should foreclose on delinquent mortgages, speeding up the painfully slow process of getting rid of the nation's surplus debt and freeing up money to start rebuilding the economy. But many of the mortgages are trapped in layers of securities at least as complex as the loan pool that held Milbank's debt—and for the investors who hold those securities, it pays to wait. The four big banks that hold nearly half of the nation's second mortgages—junior debt—don't want to be wiped out, any more than <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> wanted its junior debt on Milbank to vanish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners, too, have good reasons to delay. The federal government's policy is to keep housing prices artificially inflated—for example, through President Obama's 2009 tax break for first-time homebuyers. No surprise, then, that homeowners are hanging on, hoping that somehow they'll be able to sell high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Solving the problem won't be easy. One obvious step: the Fed could allow interest rates to rise, raising costs for borrowers and forcing them to give up bad debt. Regulators could also set a deadline on foreclosures, giving banks and servicers six months, say, to take back property whose mortgage holders are more than 90 days delinquent; banks that couldn't comply would be compelled to write down the principal on such mortgages, thereby reducing the nation's debt. Whatever the solutions are, one thing is clear: America, like the Kingsbridge buildings a half-decade ago, owes too much money. Until it reduces its enormous debt burden, economic recovery will continue to flag.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Europe's commercial-property market, which for the past two years has been slowly recovering from the depths of the financial crisis, is starting to weaken again due to fears of a global recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not long ago, investors were buying up commercial properties, especially in the U.K., France, Germany, Poland and the Nordic countries, on expectations that future economic growth would prompt companies to increase hiring, lifting occupancy levels and rental income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the spreading debt crisis has changed that forecast. Now property deals are on the decline, expansion plans are being put on hold and analysts are warning that property companies could be on the verge of a new downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a note to investors on Friday, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch warned that leading U.K.-listed property companies were overvalued, causing a sell-off and sharp correction in the shares of <span class="companylink">Land Securities Group PLC</span>, <span class="companylink">Great Portland Estates PLC</span>, and <span class="companylink">Derwent London PLC</span>. "It may be appropriate for the sector to trade at a premium in anticipation of growth," the BofA <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span> analysts wrote. "However, in the current economic environment, where growth is absent, we believe a premium is hard to justify."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many major European markets rental growth is coming to a halt, property analysts say. And as financing becomes harder to get and investors grow more cautious, deals are taking longer to close and there are fewer of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, MGPA Ltd. announced the acquisition of a top-flight retail property -- the Illum shopping center in central Copenhagen -- for 220 million euros ($315.9 million). The transaction wasn't remarkable for its size, or the location or quality of the assets involved. What made it illustrative of the state of European commercial-property markets today was the length of time it took to come together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MGPA, an independent private-equity firm that operates in Europe and Asia, and Partners Group, a Canadian institutional investor, teamed up to buy the Copenhagen property from Magillum Properties A/S, a unit of the Solstra Group, which owned the Illum center. The parties involved in the transaction exchanged contracts in February. The plan went to SEB, the Swedish bank that was to put up the financing. Then for months nothing seemed to happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There were no significant issues that needed to be cleared up and yet it took them four months to close the transaction," an advisor on the deal said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SEB said the decision on the loan for the Illum acquisition "followed our normal and standard procedure" while Steve Willingham, MGPA's chief finance officer, said the completion time was "not unusual when the $300 million size and the structural/asset re-development complexity of the deal is taken into account."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall investment volume in Europe was 26.2 billion euros in the second quarter, down 11.5% from the first quarter, according to a report on European commercial property markets in the first half of 2011 by Cushman &amp; Wakefield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>, the property services group, reported similar figures. CBRE also noted that cross-border investment -- investors from one country doing deals in another European country -- fell 19% in the second quarter, which suggests that investors are retrenching in the face of a weakening European economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We saw a massive slowdown in investment volumes in the second quarter," said Michael Rydderch, head of European Capital Markets at Cushman &amp; Wakefield -- "the first quarter-on-quarter decline since the collapse of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> in 2008."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While analysts nevertheless expect investment volume to be about 6% higher this year compared with 2010, Cushman &amp; Wakefield cut its forecast on European commercial property investment volumes to 124 billion euros in 2011, down from a previous forecast of 135 billion euros.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the overall economy showing signs of weakening, it is unclear how rental income from commercial property will be affected going forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the current recovery began in 2009, capitalization rates, the income generated from rentals as a proportion of a property's value, have been falling as prices slowly rise. This has come to a halt in most European markets, with the exception of Germany, Sweden, and Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Europe's sovereign-debt problems and general global uncertainty persist, real estate is unlikely to be the investment of choice. "The tendency under such circumstances is for capital to head for assets that offer the greatest liquidity, which do not include property," CBRE said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regional surveys of manufacturers are pointing to a downshift in activity, as a key driver of the recovery retreats amid worries about an economic downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, sales of new homes dropped to their lowest level since February, with the housing sector beset by too much supply and too little demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond's survey, released Tuesday, offered the latest downbeat assessment of manufacturing, which contracted in the central Atlantic region in August after stalling in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey's index of manufacturing activity fell to a negative 10 from negative 1 in July, indicating a sharp pullback in the sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New orders and shipments contracted, though manufacturing employment in the region showed continued expansion in August -- albeit at a slower pace than a month earlier. The index was as high as 25 in the past year, when prospects for the sector were brighter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Richmond Fed's report came after other regional surveys indicated a contraction in activity. The Philadelphia Fed last week said its index of manufacturing activity plunged in August to the lowest reading since March 2009. Almost half the manufacturing firms in that region said activity decreased during the month, while orders and other signs of future activity weakened. Another survey from the New York Fed also worsened in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest U.S. reports come amid signs of slowing activity elsewhere in the world. A preliminary gauge of manufacturing activity in China contracted in August for the second consecutive month. A European index showed activity slightly growing during the month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The regional U.S. reports tend to draw less attention than a nationwide survey of manufacturers by the Institute for Supply Management, which releases its results on the first of each month. They also can be volatile from month to month. Amid worries about slowing growth, however, the reports from the regional Fed banks offer early signs of a pullback in the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> economists said the Philadelphia Fed's index had fallen into territory that since 1968 had been associated with a recession in the overall economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other surveys suggest at least a more worrisome outlook for the factory sector. "They all point to overall weakness in manufacturing activity," said <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> economist Anika Khan. "It's the magnitude of the drop that is the most problematic."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A slowdown in manufacturing, if it persists, would come as other key sectors of the economy -- such as housing -- are under intense pressure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales fell 0.7% in July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 298,000, the lowest level since February, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the third straight monthly decline in sales. The median price of a new single-family home fell 6.3% from a month earlier to $222,000, though it increased 4.7% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of new homes available for sale fell 0.6% to 165,000, the lowest since the data series began in 1963. But homebuilders are facing a glut of unsold existing homes on the market, pushing down prices and weighing on demand for new construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Builders recognize their plight and they are basically doing no speculative building," said Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors. "The level is so low that even strong increases in sales and housing starts will not add that much to growth."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Craig Karmin   </div><div>551 words</div><div>22 August 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A18</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Witkoff Group, which prevailed in an auction for one of the former International Toy Center buildings, is teaming up with a <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> real estate fund for a $290 million condo conversion of the property, say people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developer and the real- estate fund are planning to create about 145 luxury condo apartments at the onetime office building at 1107 Broadway, next to Madison Square Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Witkoff and <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> are seeking a financing partner, but people familiar with the matter said they would close the deal next month even without debt in place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the pace of new condo construction ground to a halt during the financial crisis, there has been a minor flurry recently of prominent new projects aimed at the well-heeled buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Extell Development Co. has built more than 20 stories of a projected 1,004-foot hotel and residential tower next to Carnegie Hall, while real-estate investor CIM Group with developer Harry Macklowe are planning their own towering luxury condo building on Park Avenue at the former Drake Hotel site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, a nearly-finished glass tower, known as One Madison Park, is attracting interest from a number of local real estate firms that want to resuscitate the stalled project, including giant developer Related Cos. The building is also located at Madison Square Park and could compete for buyers with 1107 Broadway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Witkoff acquired the 16-story Broadway property, which has about 350,00 square feet, with a winning $190 million bid in an unusual one-day auction in June conducted for seller <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> by the broker Eastdil Secured.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The event attracted a number of heavy hitters, including CIM and Mr. Macklowe, <span class="companylink">SL Green Realty Corp</span>., and L&amp;L Holding Co. All of them assembled at the Third Avenue law offices of <span class="companylink">Schulte Roth &amp; Zabel LLP</span> to bid on the property, according to people familiar with the matter. The bidders declined to comment or could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The participants were required to post $5 million two days before the auction, and the winner had to wire another $5 million within 24 hours of its conclusion. Typically, properties of this size and price are carried out through blind auctions in multiple rounds that could stretch for weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Witkoff and <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> expect to spend $100 million to renovate the building, which has been virtually vacant since 2007. The interiors have already been demolished and while the building isn't landmarked, the new owners aren't expected to make significant changes to the property's exterior, say people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> lent more than $300 million to a venture led by Tessler Developments, which had also planned a condo conversion for 1107 Broadway. But the developers defaulted on their debt before the project could get going.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, Lehman also agreed to sell its majority stake in 200 Fifth Avenue, the other Toy Center building, to a real-estate fund run by <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> for about $700 million. The building is home to popular Italian food marketplace Eataly and a <span class="companylink">Tiffany &amp; Co</span>. store.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos                And Conor Dougherty   </div><div>1598 words</div><div>19 August 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. economy is showing new signs of fatigue, depressing financial markets, discouraging consumers and unsettling businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 419.63 points, or 3.7%, Thursday, and is down 9.5% for August amid soaring trading volume and some of the worst volatility on record. Angst about the health of the U.S. and European economies, and the stability of European banks, sent investors rushing to the safety of U.S. Treasurys. Yields on the 10-year note briefly dropped below 2% for the first time in at least 50 years. Gold jumped to a new record. Asian shares fell sharply in early trading Friday, with benchmark indexes in Japan down 1.8%, Australia down 2.7% and South Korea down 4.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest batch of economic data offered little reason for optimism. Sales of previously owned homes fell 3.5% in July from June, the National Association of Realtors reported, another sign that the hoped-for housing recovery isn't materializing. The data came as a surprise because of earlier reports of an increase in May and June in the number of contracts signed to buy homes. That suggests some buyers are backing out of deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A normally overlooked measure, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank's survey of local manufacturers, drew attention as it plunged into territory usually seen only in recessions. Earlier in the week, a similar New York Fed survey suggested a downturn in manufacturing in New York state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New claims for unemployment benefits rose by 9,000 to a seasonally adjusted 408,000, a bit above the 400,000 mark that an economists' rule of thumb indicates enough jobs are being created to bring down unemployment, now at 9.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department said that, adjusted for its latest inflation readings, average weekly wages in July for those Americans who do have jobs were 1.3% lower than their recent peak in October 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About the only hopeful sign on Thursday was a 0.5% increase in the Conference Board's index of 10 leading economic indicators designed to predict the economy's direction, the third rise in as many months. But the keepers of that metric saw little encouraging there. "The economy is slow, with little momentum, and shows no indication of acceleration," said Ken Goldstein, an economist at the nonprofit business-research group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. economy grew sluggishly in the first half of the year, weighed down by a rise in oil prices and the disruption of production following the Japanese earthquake. Hopes for a more buoyant second half have all but evaporated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's clear that not all of the weakness was due to these one-time factors—and, in light of this, I have revised down my expectations for the pace of the recovery going forward," the president of the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of New York</span>, William Dudley, said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no sure-fire way to tell whether the U.S. economy already has lapsed into renewed recession or whether it will soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If it's not a recession, it sure feels like one. And if it feels like one, it doesn't matter if you can prove it with statistics or not," said John Hailer, president of <span class="companylink">Natixis Global Asset Management</span> in the U.S. and Asia. "We have some real tough problems in front of us, and we really need some leadership in corporate America and Washington...There's a lot of nervousness in the market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four dozen economic forecasters surveyed by The Wall Street Journal earlier in August said there was only a 13% chance that a recession already has begun. But they saw rising risks that one is looming. On average, they put the odds of recession in the next year at 29%, up from 17% only a month earlier; 10 of them put the odds at 40% or higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've said there is a 35% chance of recession, but if the stock-market weakness persists, we're going to keep on raising those odds," Ethan Harris, economist at Bank of American <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span>, said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An estimate of monthly gross domestic product compiled by <span class="companylink">Macroeconomic Advisers</span> of St. Louis indicates that GDP, the value of all goods and services produced, declined in January and February, rose in the following two months, and then fell again in May and June. By the forecasting firm's measure, U.S. GDP was lower in June than it was in December 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite spreading distress about the economy, some recent government indicators do suggest early-summer signs of life. The Fed said Tuesday that its index of manufacturing production rose 0.6% in July, more than in any month since March, fueled by an upturn in auto manufacturing. And although surveys show consumer confidence sinking, the Commerce Department's broad measure of retail sales rose more in July than in the previous three months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worries about the economy threaten to further set back the fragile housing market. Anthony Lamacchia, a real-estate agent in Waltham, Mass., said two buyers backed out of tentative deals in the past two weeks. "People called and said, 'We're worried about our jobs. We don't want to buy a house anymore,'" he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Las Vegas, Lisa and Robbie Swift signed a contract to buy a house late last year. But then they learned that "The Lion King"—where she works with child actors and he plays several roles including Ed the Hyena and Timon—would be shutting down in December. "In a panic state, we called our real estate agent," said Ms. Swift. "We'd all waited three months for this to go through. It was a short sale. But we just decided to get out of it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple will be touring with the musical nationally, but Ms. Swift said she is "still sad that we're renting and that we don't have our own investment."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales don't appear to be benefiting from mortgage rates that have fallen to their lowest levels in at least half a century. Rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 4.15% for the week ended Thursday, according to a <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> survey. Yet applications for home-purchase mortgages were down 9.1% last week from the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrew Hornback, 36, and his wife were preparing to buy their first house last fall in Queens, N.Y., when he lost his job as an information-technology professional. "Buying a house was right on the horizon," he said. The money they were "squirreling away" for a down payment is "getting chipped away at because you need things like health insurance," he added.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of previously owned U.S. homes fell in July to the lowest level this year, and prices also tumbled, a sign the housing sector won't regain its footing any time soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes declined 3.5% from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.67 million, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had expected home sales to rise by 4% to an annual rate of 4.96 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales in June were revised to 4.84 million from a previously estimated 4.77 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, the National Association of Realtors' chief economist, said many consumers are being held back because they can't get financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Those potential buyers represent the difference between an uneven recovery and a much more robust housing market that could stimulate additional economic activity and create jobs," Mr. Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of previously owned homes listed for sale fell at the end of July to 3.65 million. That reflected a 9.4-month supply at the current sales pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A level considered healthy is about six months, but Mr. Yun said a silver lining in the report was that inventories appear to be under control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An advantage of an existing home is its price. The median in July across the U.S. was $174,000, down 4.4% from $182,100 a year earlier and much lower than that of a new home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing sector made a positive contribution to the economy in the second quarter, but it was a small boost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High unemployment is discouraging American consumers from making big purchases, and the restrained demand, coupled with an oversupply, has turned off homebuilders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, construction of single-family homes fell. Apartment-building starts, however, rose, as many people opt to rent instead of buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say stronger income and job growth are needed to spur home buying and reduce the large inventory of foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors' report said home sales decreased last month compared with a month earlier in two of four regions of the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales were down 12.6% in the western U.S. and declined 1.6% in the South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales rose 2.7% in the Northeast region, and they were up 1% in the Midwest.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos and Conor Dougherty   </div><div>1342 words</div><div>19 August 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. economy is showing new signs of fatigue, depressing financial markets, discouraging consumers and unsettling businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 419.63 points, or 3.7%, Thursday, and is down 9.5% for August amid soaring trading volume and some of the worst volatility on record. Angst about the health of the U.S. and European economies, and the stability of European banks, sent investors rushing to the safety of U.S. Treasurys. Yields on the 10-year note briefly dropped below 2% for the first time in at least 50 years. Gold jumped to a new record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asian shares fell sharply in early trading Friday, with benchmark indexes in Japan down 1.8%, Australia down 2.7% and South Korea down 4.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest batch of economic data offered little reason for optimism. Sales of previously owned homes fell 3.5% in July from June, the National Association of Realtors reported, another sign that the hoped-for housing recovery isn't materializing. The data came as a surprise because of earlier reports of an increase in May and June in the number of contracts signed to buy homes. That suggests some buyers are backing out of deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A normally overlooked measure, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank's survey of local manufacturers, drew attention as it plunged into territory usually seen only in recessions. Earlier in the week, a similar New York Fed survey suggested a downturn in manufacturing in New York state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New claims for unemployment benefits rose by 9,000 to a seasonally adjusted 408,000, a bit above the 400,000 mark that an economists' rule of thumb indicates enough jobs are being created to bring down unemployment, now at 9.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department said that, adjusted for its latest inflation readings, average weekly wages in July for those Americans who do have jobs were 1.3% lower than their recent peak in October 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About the only hopeful sign on Thursday was a 0.5% increase in the Conference Board's index of 10 leading economic indicators designed to predict the economy's direction, the third rise in as many months. But the keepers of that metric saw little encouraging there. "The economy is slow, with little momentum, and shows no indication of acceleration," said Ken Goldstein, an economist at the nonprofit business-research group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. economy grew sluggishly in the first half of the year, weighed down by a rise in oil prices and the disruption of production following the Japanese earthquake. Hopes for a more buoyant second half have all but evaporated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's clear that not all of the weakness was due to these one-time factors -- and, in light of this, I have revised down my expectations for the pace of the recovery going forward," the president of the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of New York</span>, William Dudley, said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If it's not a recession, it sure feels like one. And if it feels like one, it doesn't matter if you can prove it with statistics or not," said John Hailer, president of <span class="companylink">Natixis Global Asset Management</span> in the U.S. and Asia. "We have some real tough problems in front of us, and we really need some leadership in corporate America and Washington . . . There's a lot of nervousness in the market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've said there is a 35% chance of recession, but if the stock-market weakness persists, we're going to keep on raising those odds," Ethan Harris, economist at Bank of American <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span>, said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An estimate of monthly gross domestic product compiled by <span class="companylink">Macroeconomic Advisers</span> of St. Louis indicates that GDP, the value of all goods and services produced, declined in January and February, rose in the following two months, and then fell again in May and June. By the forecasting firm's measure, U.S. GDP was lower in June than it was in December 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite spreading distress about the economy, some recent government indicators do suggest early-summer signs of life. The Fed said Tuesday that its index of manufacturing production rose 0.6% in July, more than in any month since March, fueled by an upturn in auto manufacturing. And although surveys show consumer confidence sinking, the Commerce Department's broad measure of retail sales rose more in July than in the previous three months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worries about the economy threaten to further set back the fragile housing market. Anthony Lamacchia, a real-estate agent in Waltham, Mass., said two buyers backed out of tentative deals in the past two weeks. "People called and said, 'We're worried about our jobs. We don't want to buy a house anymore,'" he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Las Vegas, Lisa and Robbie Swift signed a contract to buy a house late last year. But then they learned that "The Lion King" -- where she works with child actors and he plays several roles including Ed the Hyena and Timon -- would be shutting down in December. "In a panic state, we called our real estate agent," said Ms. Swift. "We'd all waited three months for this to go through. It was a short sale. But we just decided to get out of it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales don't appear to be benefiting from mortgage rates that have fallen to their lowest levels in at least half a century. Rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 4.15% for the week ended Thursday, according to a <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> survey. Yet applications for home-purchase mortgages were down 9.1% last week from the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrew Hornback and his wife were preparing to buy their first house last fall in Queens, N.Y., when he lost his job as an information-technology professional. "Buying a house was right on the horizon," he said. The money they were "squirreling away" for a down payment is "getting chipped away at because you need things like health insurance," he added. The couple hopes to buy one day, but has delayed their plans indefinitely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Buyer confidence may be an all-time low," said Anthony Sanders, a real estate finance professor at George Mason University. "The economy is scaring the living daylights out of most potential homebuyers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contributing to the gloomy outlook for the economy is a pullback in federal, state and local government spending. <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>, the rating firm, said Thursday that the deficit-reduction deal it previously pronounced as inadequate "could undermine the already fragile economic recovery."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos   </div><div>615 words</div><div>19 August 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prospective home buyers are turning the stock-market turmoil and fresh worries about the economy into an opportunity to lower their offers on properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ryan Goodman just reduced bids on two homes in Barrington, Ill., "because the stock market sold off so much last week," the 36-year-old risk analyst said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, Mr. Goodman and his wife offered $680,000 for a home listed at $800,000. While the seller later lowered the asking price to $750,000, the couple last week made a new offer of $650,000. "Unless we get a steal, we're not going to buy any house," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That dynamic threatens to put more pressure on home prices. "Buyers are going to use every point of leverage they can to get a lower price," said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of real-estate brokerage <span class="companylink">Redfin Corp</span>. "Sellers have to ask themselves how many people woke up this morning and said, 'It's a good day to buy a house.' Far fewer than two or three weeks ago."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a shaky economy chills housing activity, that also would make it harder for the Goodmans to sell the house they have lived in for nearly 10 years. Their home is on the market but after two dozen showings, has only netted what Mr. Goodman describes as a few "low-ball" offers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple had hoped to move before the school year begins, but that is looking unlikely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Goodman said he doesn't have to sell his house before he purchases a new one. That isn't the case for many "trade-up" borrowers, who can't purchase a home until they find someone who will buy their house and leave them with enough money for their next down payment. That's an important reason why housing demand remains weak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Goodman signed a contract to buy a home in May, but the deal fell apart after a home inspection turned up problems with a balcony the seller wasn't willing to fix. That property is still on the market, and Mr. Goodman said he is considering making another bid. "We'll see if they're willing to fix it," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New data out Thursday underscored the notion that a buyer's market prevails in U.S. housing. Sales of previously owned homes fell 3.5% in July from June, the National Association of Realtors reported, even as mortgage rates have fallen to their lowest levels in more than 50 years. Some analysts say the Federal Reserve's pledge last week to keep short-term interest rates near zero for two years could reduce any urgency for buyers to pull the trigger on a transaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed's statement gave buyers "comfort that they are not missing out on low interest rates if they wait," said John Burns, a home-building consultant in Irvine, Calif. That has tilted even more power toward home buyers, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a town-hall event this week in Atkinson, Ill., President Barack Obama predicted that it would "probably take this year and next year for us to see a slow appreciation again in the housing market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was responding to a question from LuAnn Lavine, a real-estate agent from Geneseo, Ill., who told him the phones stopped ringing in July after the debt-ceiling "fiasco." "We have no consumer confidence after what has just happened," she said. "Interest rates are a record low. I should be out working 14 hours a day, and I am not."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. industrial production rebounded in July, allaying some fears about the economy losing momentum in the second half of the year. But a drop in housing starts showed that a key sector of the economy remains depressed, with little hope for improvement in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall industrial production rose 0.9%, marking the biggest increase this year, the Federal Reserve said Tuesday. The improvement reflected gains in the manufacturing sector, increased mining and higher output from electric utilities as summer weather spurred demand for air conditioning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The manufacturing boost came largely from a 5.2% gain in auto production as U.S. plants recovered from supply-chain disruptions related to Japan's earthquake and tsunami. Apart from autos, production of electronics and business equipment improved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The boost in overall output meant that industries used 77.5% of their available capacity during the month, up from 76.9 in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report suggests that the economic slowdown earlier in the year may be subsiding, despite worries about weak consumer demand. "The recovery may have regained some momentum in recent months, and it could go some way in easing fears of an impending recession," said <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span> analyst Millan Mulraine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, a number of factors are likely to weigh on the economy at least into next year. Consumer sentiment has fallen to historic lows amid volatility in financial markets and weak job growth, and the lackluster housing sector is unlikely to improve much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts fell 1.5% in July to an annual rate of 604,000, driven by a drop in construction of single-family homes, the Commerce Department said. Starts on multifamily homes, a traditionally volatile sector, jumped 6% to an annual rate of 170,000 as builders broke ground on apartments and other rental units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is hobbled by a glut of properties, with waves of foreclosures on the horizon and weak consumer demand helping to push down prices. Housing starts are off about 73% from their January 2006 peak during the residential boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are scant prospects for significant improvement anytime soon. Permits for new construction -- a sign of future activity -- fell 3.2% to a pace of 597,000. Sentiment among builders remains extremely low, as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts fell almost 38% in the Midwest and 3% in the West. They rose about 35% in the Northeast and 6% in the South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Labor Department said the price of imported goods edged up 0.3% in July, driven by higher costs for industrial supplies, consumer goods and food. Import prices are up 14% from a year ago as China and other emerging markets face inflationary pressures. But they are expected to ease in coming months as the costs of oil and other commodities drop.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts fell 1.5% in July to an annual rate of 604,000, driven by a drop in construction of single-family homes, the Commerce Department said. Starts on multi-family homes, a traditionally volatile sector, jumped 6% to an annual rate of 170,000 as builders broke ground on apartments and other rental units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is hobbled by a glut of properties, with waves of foreclosures on the horizon and weak consumer demand helping to push down prices. Housing starts are off about 73% from their January 2006 peak during the residential boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's scant prospect of significant improvement anytime soon. Permits for new construction—a sign of future activity—fell 3.2% to a pace of 597,000. Sentiment among builders remains extremely low as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts fell almost 38% in the Midwest and 3% in the West. They rose about 35% in the Northeast and 6% in the South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Labor Department said the price of imported goods edged up 0.3% in July, driven by higher costs for industrial supplies, consumer goods and food. Import prices are up 14% from a year ago as China and other emerging markets face inflationary pressures. But they are expected to ease in coming months as the costs of oil and other commodities drop.</p>

</div><div class="author">By A.D. Pruitt   </div><div>617 words</div><div>17 August 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial real estate could be losing its cachet as a safe-haven investment due to concerns about the economy and reduced access to bank financing for landlords.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For most of the past year, investors snapped up the stocks of real-estate investment trusts, thought to be immune from the turmoil in Europe's debt crisis and unrest in the Middle East. Investors also were attracted to REITS for their high yields and the prospect that rising employment would lift rents and occupancy for office complexes, apartment buildings and hotels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first half of the year, the Dow Jones Equity All REIT Index was up 9.9%, compared with a 6% rise in the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> stock Index, on a total return basis. The recent performance caps a two-year period in which REITs have been on a hot streak, returning nearly 30%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Despite all the market turmoil, U.S. equities are now in positive territory for the year and investors can enjoy a healthy dividend yield," says Paul Adornato, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets. He added that REITS have been effective at raising hefty amounts of equity and debt over the past couple of years to repair balance sheets and prep for acquisitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, in recent weeks, REITs have gotten roughed up as investor sentiment abruptly changed. The U.S. default scare and subsequent credit downgrade, along with growing concerns about a double-dip recession, unleashed a broad-based market panic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, analysts say, the access to funding that real-estate companies enjoyed in the commercial-mortgage-backed-securities markets, a critical lending pool for landlords, is closing. Volatility has made bankers more reluctant to provide new CMBS loans—pools of commercial mortgages sold as bonds—while investors are showing less demand for these securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Commercial real estate would [normally] appear like a safe haven with hard assets and long-term leases," said Lawrence Longua, a professor at New York University's Schack Institute of Real Estate. But, he said, the slowdown in CMBS lending makes it more difficult to raise financing for acquisitions and refinance debt. "The CMBS market," he said, "is really kind of dead in the water right now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs are now trading like other stocks. The total return for the Dow Jones Equity All REIT Index was down 10.42% in the past three weeks, compared with 10.45% drop for the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> stock index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problems in the CMBS market also have begun to affect property values. After nearly two years of uninterrupted gains, property values have cooled, according to Green Street Advisors' Commercial Property Price Index, which was flat in June and July. The CPPI tracks properties owned by 47 real-estate investment trusts with roughly $400 billion in assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Green Street blamed the pause partly on the CMBS woes and concerns about the economy. "Unsettling economic data has caused buyers to reassess how aggressive they want to be [investing] in future rent and occupancy growth," said Jim Sullivan managing director for REIT research at Green Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think some investors fear a double-dip recession," says Jay Leupp, portfolio manager of the <span class="companylink">Grubb &amp; Ellis</span> AGA Mutual Funds. "In the very short term, investors tend to sell everything all at once and seek the higher ground either in commodities like gold or U.S. Treasurys."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said that, over time, the largest REITs should return as a safer and more attractive bet compared to banking or financial stocks because REITs have higher-than-average dividend yields, ample liquidity and potential for earnings growth.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. industrial production rebounded in July, allaying some fears about the economy losing momentum in the second half of the year. But a drop in housing starts showed that a key sector of the economy remains depressed, with little hope for improvement in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall industrial production rose 0.9%, marking the biggest increase this year, the Federal Reserve said Tuesday. The improvement reflected gains in the manufacturing sector, increased mining and higher output from utilities as hot weather spurred demand for air conditioning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The manufacturing boost came largely from a 5.2% gain in auto production as plants recovered from supply-chain disruptions related to Japan's earthquake and tsunami. Apart from autos, output of electronics and business equipment improved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The boost in overall output meant that industries used 77.5% of their available capacity during the month, up from 76.9% in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report suggests the slowdown earlier in the year may be subsiding, despite worries about weak consumer demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, a number of factors are likely to weigh on the economy at least into next year. Consumer sentiment has fallen to historic lows amid volatility in financial markets and weak job growth, while the lackluster housing sector is unlikely to improve much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts fell 1.5% in July to an annual rate of 604,000, driven by a drop in construction of single-family homes, the Commerce Department said.

</div><div class="author">By Tom Orlik  </div><div>1097 words</div><div>15 August 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beijing -- The outlook for China's housing sector is both crucially important for the world economy and -- because of weakness in the data -- very hard to predict.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite a government push this year for more-accurate home-price data from China's National Bureau of Statistics, international markets -- and most Chinese consumers -- remain deeply dubious of the official monthly figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">July data from the National Bureau of Statistics are due out Thursday, but confidence in the official figures is so low that the markets pay more attention to numbers from a private data provider, the China Real Estate Index System.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China, an engine of global growth, has to do better at explaining this key sector of its economy. Take Shanghai, the country's financial hub and richest city. According to data from the China Real Estate Index System, prices of new apartments in Shanghai have risen by more than 150% in the past five years. That outpaces a 107% increase in wages over the same period -- moving home ownership further out of reach for average earners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the official data tell a different story. According to China's NBS, prices for new apartments in Shanghai have climbed 20% over the past five years -- well below the increase in wages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As important, though the trend in both data series is upward, the path mapped out by the private data is more volatile -- with bigger ups and downs in the growth rate than in the official data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why is the difference between those two sets of figures so important? (Full disclosure: I investigate the question in detail in my book "Understanding China's Economic Indicators.") Investment in residential real estate accounts directly for 12% of China's gross domestic product, and more than that when demand for steel, cement, and other construction materials is factored in. China's real-estate boom helps energize the domestic economy and keeps miners from Australia to Brazil flush with cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House prices are a key leading indicator of changes in policy, sales and investment. Rising prices attract speculators into the market. Entrepreneurs and billionaires descend on Beijing and Shanghai with suitcases of cash, snapping up entire floors of luxury residential developments. Higher sales encourage developers to break ground on more-lavish projects. But if prices rise too fast, the government has to step in to cool the market, speculators move to the sidelines, and developers put down their tools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beijing could be forgiven for a little tardiness in getting up to speed on housing data. The boom that has made developers and speculators rich and left young professionals grasping for the first rung on the real-estate ladder is a recent phenomenon. As recently as 15 years ago, the private-property market was almost nonexistent. Home for most workers was employer-provided housing. But with an incipient property bubble threatening to cause economic disorder and social unrest, the government has attempted to bring prices under control, with the latest crackdown kicking off in April 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, if prices have risen only as fast as the official data suggest, there is no need to worry. With just a slight mismatch between prices and incomes, a brief period with a slower increase in prices will improve affordability. When that happens, the government will be able to loosen its controls, sales will rise, and developers will be powering up their cement mixers -- reassuring international markets that the economy is humming along. If the official numbers are also correct that house prices typically move gradually and within a small range, even continued controls by the government are unlikely to result in a sharp correction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if -- as seems more likely -- the China Real Estate Index System data are correct and prices are considerably out of whack with income, the government in Beijing and reluctant local officials will have to maintain controls on the sector for a long time, raising the specter of a rough patch for China's economy. Equally worrying, if movements in prices are as volatile as the private data suggest, the chances of a policy misstep leading to a sharp correction are higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite, or perhaps because of, the importance attached to real estate, there are few areas of China's economy where the official data are less reliable. In 2009, the combination of a slowdown in growth that hit many home buyers in the pocketbook and continued failure by statisticians to report the rapid increase in house prices evident to would-be buyers was too much for public opinion to bear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Bureau of Statistics' announcement of an increase in average house prices of just 1.5% was met with public skepticism. One Chinese Internet commentator asked: "Can you believe that? Obviously a misplaced decimal point."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outrage over the 2009 data sparked some change. But the new system rolled out in January wasn't much of an improvement. On the plus side, outdated and unrepresentative samples that analysts believe were to blame for problems with the old data were replaced by a system that captures every sale of new property. On the down side, the national average figure -- the best guide to the overall state of China's housing sector and a major focus of market attention -- was shelved in favor of more detailed city-level data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That differs from practices in the U.S., where the monthly <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller index and new-home sales data from the Census Bureau both provide national benchmarks for price changes as well as city or regional breakdowns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding to the confusion, local officials in China control the flow of high- and low-price property on to the market, affecting the movement of the data. Nicole Wong, China property analyst at CLSA, said when the government cracks down on property speculators, officials withhold permission for developers to bring high-value properties to market -- contributing to the appearance of falling prices. When the heat is off, more-expensive developments are allowed back in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sleight of hand by local officials -- moving the house-price index without changing the underlying situation -- does little to solve China's housing bubble, or to provide investors and policy makers with an accurate understanding of the sector. If the Chinese government is serious about controlling runaway house prices, the first step should be to provide credible data on exactly how high home prices actually are.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William Maxwell is an expert in finance. He's a professor at Southern Methodist University's business school, has co-authored a book on high-yield debt and spent years calculating values of financial markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet there's one valuation he can't understand: the appraisal of his Dallas home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August 2010, Mr. Maxwell's home was appraised at $790,000 as part of a mortgage refinancing. Yet this past spring, when he tried to sell the four-bedroom home for $756,500, the appraisal commissioned by the buyer's lender, <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>., came up with a value of $730,000. Mr. Maxwell said the appraisal killed the sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weak appraisals are "driving down the real-estate market," Mr. Maxwell says. Saying the appraisal process "borders on buffoonery," he's appealing his home's valuation to the Texas regulator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the conclusions from the housing bust: The appraisal system was broken. One of the conclusions some have drawn from the struggling recovery since then: The appraisal system is still broken, but in a different way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is little doubt that home values have depreciated sharply in recent years for the most basic of economic reasons: excess supply of homes on the market and weak demand. But some realtors, home-sellers and economists believe low-ball appraisals also are undermining a housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Appraisals are supposed to be unbiased assessments of a property's value. The housing bubble that burst a few years ago was inflated, in part, by overly generous appraisals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, lenders are pressuring appraisers to come in with lower estimates, some real-estate professionals say. Banks also are using less-experienced appraisers, who often don't appreciate factors that make a home worth more, they say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And valuations are being heavily influenced by distressed sales priced at a discount to the rest of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders are "instructing appraisers to be a little conservative, and that responsibility on the one hand is seen as credit tightening and, on the other, as exacerbating the housing problem," says Columbia Business School economist Chris Mayer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A research paper last year titled "How Much Is That Home Really Worth?" by economist Leonard Nakamura at the Philadelphia Federal Reserve also cited a downward bias in appraisals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Disputes over valuations are rising. The National Association of Realtors said that 16% of realtors surveyed reported a cancellation in June of this year, and chief economist Lawrence Yun blamed the unusually large number on low appraisals. In June of 2010, only 9% of those surveyed reported a cancellation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A survey by the group earlier this year found that 10%-12% of members had a contract canceled last year as a result of a low appraisal; 10%-13% had a contract delayed; and 16%-20% reported that the sales price was negotiated lower due to a low appraisal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone agrees the appraisal system is broken. The Mortgage Bankers Association, an industry trade group, concedes that appraisals are conservative but says they need to be, partly to protect the banks from future problems with investors who buy mortgages. "There's an extra note of caution," said Steve O'Connor, a senior vice president at the association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And some appraisers say homeowners are just having trouble facing reality. "It's the market. It's not the changes" in the appraisal process, says Charles MacPhee, a partner with Buttler Appraisals LLC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. MacPhee's company performed an appraisal in Decatur, Ga., last year that drew ire. John and Michelle Pennie were about to give up on selling their house last spring when an offer came in -- just in time to qualify for the 2010 federal tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two sides agreed on a sale price of $365,000, with the Pennies paying $8,000 in closing costs. "We were ecstatic," Mr. Pennie says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the appraisal put the home's worth at $327,000. And the deal ultimately collapsed. "Understandably in a declining market, you're going to have declining appraisals," Mr. Pennie says. "But when you have two parties who agree on a price, to then have an appraiser come in and make it $40,000 below. . .how do you ever get out of a falling market?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For decades, appraising a home was both an art and a science, executed primarily by independent professionals who were experts on their local markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Designed to protect both the borrower and lender, appraisals were based largely on selling prices of comparable homes. But appraisers also combed through property records and interviewed brokers, buyers, sellers -- and even other appraisers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks selected the appraiser and often had influence over the outcome. Home buyers paid the fee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the aftermath of the housing bust, then-New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo sought to reform the appraisal industry by convincing <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> to bar loan officers, mortgage brokers or real-estate agents from any role in selecting appraisers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides combating inflated and sometimes fraudulent appraisals, the goal was to eliminate pressure on appraisers to provide estimates that match the contract price, which would increase chances that the mortgage loan would get approved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sweeping Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul law that went into effect in 2010 went one step further to bolster appraiser independence by regulating both the industry and the fees they are paid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather than hire appraisers whose work is known to them, banks now outsource their selection to appraisal-management companies, which are often units of other banks and financial companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These appraisal-management companies take a sizable cut of the fee, leaving the appraisers under pressure to work faster and cheaper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result has been that appraisers with less experience or who are unfamiliar with a community -- but who work cheap -- are getting assignments while more experienced appraisers are going out business. That, say critics, is producing appraisals that are less accurate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've lost the best quality appraisers," said Leslie Sellers, the immediate past president of the Appraisal Institute, a trade group. "The people doing it are the ones who have cut overhead to bone, are working out of basements and many of them are not properly educated." The Institute estimates there are currently under 90,000 certified appraisers, down from nearly 100,000 in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Mr. Maxwell's case, he says that the appraiser, James Applegate, works in Plano, a suburb 20 miles from Dallas, and was unfamiliar with Mr. Maxwell's Dallas neighborhood of Lakewood, an affluent community near a picturesque lake. Mr. Maxwell also claims that Mr. Applegate improperly used less desirable homes as comparables, or "comps," to arrive at a value. In a June 17 formal letter of complaint with the Texas Appraiser Licensing and Certification Board, which regulates the industry, Mr. Maxwell said that Mr. Applegate had used a home near an elementary school that encounters a lot of traffic. Mr. Maxwell's home, by comparison, sits on a quiet, quarter-acre lot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calls to Mr. Applegate were returned by a <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> spokeswoman, who declined to comment on Mr. Maxwell's situation. She did say the lender has received feedback from customers asking it to reevaluate "geographic competency in our appraisal reports." She said efforts are being made to find appraisers who generally work within 15 miles of a property; if no appraiser is available, the company assigns alternate appraisers with local experience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others complain that appraisers are using foreclosures and other distress sales as comps when coming up with estimates. Because foreclosures tend to sell at big discounts from the actual value, some argue that shouldn't be used.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least four states -- Illinois, Nevada, Missouri and Maryland -- have considered legislation that would bar appraisers from using distress sales when drawing estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists disagree. They argue that foreclosures account for such a large share of housing sales that it's perfectly acceptable to use them as comps, or to use them but adjust pricing accordingly. "A third of transactions are previously foreclosed homes. In some markets, it's close to 50%," said Columbia's Mr. Mayer. "It would be one thing if you're talking about throwing out a small number of transactions."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another complaint is that appraisers are increasingly relying on automated valuation models, or AVMs, computer programs that extrapolate home values based on reams of property data, and public and privately compiled databases. The industry began automating in the mid-1990s, but it wasn't until a few years ago that AVMs took hold in a big way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AVMs are most reliable when there are a larger number of typical transactions to observe. But during the housing slump, typical transactions have been scarce while distressed sales have been abundant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the biggest complaints is that appraisers, in their haste, are overlooking or missing important elements that could add substantial value to a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Erin Wanner, a sales executive with Stirling Sotheby's International Realty in Orlando, Fla., says one of her deals fell through when an appraisal came in 40% lower than expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property, a custom-built lakefront, 7,000-square-foot home on four acres was appraised by the builder in 2008 at $1.2 million. Ms. Wanner's clients went under contract on the property for $650,000 in a short sale -- one in which the bank agrees to receive less than the amount owed on the mortgage. The appraisal came in at $380,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When I first heard it, I thought it was a joke," Ms. Wanner says. She noticed that a guest house on the property and total lot size -- as well as the number of fireplaces and its heated pool -- weren't included in the valuation, which would have sharply boosted the appraised value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She also thinks the appraiser wasn't familiar enough with the community and may have used comparisons with less affluent houses nearby, such as homes situated on ponds versus lakes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Wanner says appraisers today seem less knowledgeable. "Real estate is a neighborhood business," she said. "One neighborhood can be hit, another can be flourishing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said the new laws prevent lenders and agents from contracting the appraiser directly, which has been especially frustrating. "Once we get the report, it states that individual's opinion of value, and that's that."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> posted a $2.1 billion loss during the second quarter, down from a year-ago loss of $4.7 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mortgage-finance giant paid $1.6 billion to the government and asked for $1.5 billion in new aid during the quarter. That marked the fourth consecutive period in which, after making its regular dividend payment to the government, the company didn't generate a loss for taxpayers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report came on the same day that <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> downgraded the long-term credit rating of <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and its larger cousin, <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, to AA-plus from AAA. That stemmed from S&amp;P's decision late Friday to cut the credit rating of the U.S. government, which effectively nationalized Fannie and Freddie three years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. government has pledged to keep Fannie and Freddie afloat by injecting unlimited amounts of money into both in order to keep mortgage markets functioning. Fannie and Freddie are required to pay a 10% dividend to the government on those infusions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past year, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> has absorbed $2.1 billion in government aid to cover, in part, the cost of $6.4 billion in payments to the Treasury. The cost of the government's bailout of Freddie stands at $51.9 billion. <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> last week reported a net loss of $2.9 billion for the second quarter and asked the government for another $2.8 billion on Friday, bringing its tab to $89 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Freddie's quarterly loss stemmed in part from losses on derivatives that are used to hedge the firm's exposure to swings in interest rates. The firm also added $2.5 billion to its loss reserves, up from a $2 billion addition in the first quarter. While mortgage rates have fallen to new lows over the past two weeks, Chief Executive Charles "Ed" Haldeman Jr. warned that "labor market weakness and households' worries about their financial security" had damped home sales, prompting a "cautious" outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While both companies ran up huge losses in the two years following the government takeover, Freddie has shown glimmers of stability in recent quarters. That stems in part from the size of its loan book, which is about 40% smaller than Fannie's, and because Freddie guaranteed fewer risky loans than Fannie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fannie's higher losses are due in part to what some industry executives call the "Countrywide factor." Fannie long cultivated close ties with <span class="companylink">Countrywide Financial Corp</span>., once the nation's largest mortgage lender which was acquired by <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>. in 2008. Of the two government-backed loan giants, Fannie bought the bulk of Countrywide's conforming loans, which deteriorated sharplyas the housing boom turned to bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> longpushed to buy more Countrywide loans, the company's inability to do so "of course ended up being a blessing," said Rob Zimmer, a former <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> lobbyist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of June, around 3.5% of mortgages guaranteed by <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> were 90 days or more past due, compared with 4.08% at <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>. Fannie has around $200 billion in non-performing home loans, compared with roughly $115 billion at Freddie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the companies were placed into conservatorship three years ago, Freddie initially posted much larger losses than Fannie. Freddie purchased larger quantities of riskier mortgage bonds issued by Wall Street firms, and those investments triggered steep write-downs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fannie, by contrast, loosened its standards for its bread-and-butter business of stamping a guarantee on mortgages that were bundled and sold to investors as securities. As the housing bust has gotten worse, that has led to far larger losses. A <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> spokeswoman declined to comment.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New construction permits in New York are on the rise, a sign that the city's ailing construction industry may be picking up steam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction permits for new buildings, alterations and demolition rose by about 12% during the first half of 2011 compared with the same period last year, according to new data from the city Department of Buildings. Demolitions—generally an indicator that developers are starting projects—jumped 14%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Large-scale projects have been hard to come by in post-financial crisis New York. The boost in new permits is an encouraging sign for the industry, but the numbers don't indicate whether these are large or small construction jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while the number of construction permits is an improvement from 2010 and 2009, they are still about 6% below the figures of the first half of 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"More construction permits mean more people are going to work," said Buildings Commissioner Robert LiMandri.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York's construction industry has been plagued by high unemployment since the downturn began. During the first quarter of this year, there were 101,200 people employed by the industry, according to New York Building Congress, a trade association. That's the lowest level since 1998.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think it's getting worse for us," said Jack Kittle, political director for DC 9 International Union of Painters and Allied Trades. Good construction workers who are usually in high demand typically don't show up to union halls unless they are out of work, he said. "That's when you know things are bad. I see a lot of them right now," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private developers are still having a tough time convincing lenders to finance big projects, said Richard T. Anderson, president of the New York Building Congress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has made the construction industry more reliant on public institutions such as the New York City School Construction Authority and the City University of New York for work, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in construction permits is "certainly a positive sign," but the improvement has been undercut by the number of stalled sites in the city, Mr. Anderson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are about 650 stalled sites across the five boroughs, according to the Department of Buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They have been at a stubbornly high level," Mr. Anderson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some projects have come back to life in recent months. Extell Development Co.'s 34-story International Gem Tower in the Diamond District started work recently after months of inactivity, said John Livingston, president of Tishman Construction Corp., which is building the tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More projects are on the way, he said. Tishman has begun preconstruction at the Donnell Library on West 53rd Street, where <span class="companylink">Starwood Capital Group</span> and Tribeca Associates plan to build a $400 million hotel and condo tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We got a lot in the queue," Mr. Livingston said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2009 and 2010, there was a lot of pessimism among developers, but that has begun to shift, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is a renewed confidence. We are cautiously optimistic about the future," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Lambeck, head of the construction management program at New York University's Schack Institute of Real Estate, said the increase in permits is encouraging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, he added, a bounce-back is far from certain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent debt showdown in Washington, D.C., and plunging financial markets may give already-jittery lenders further cause for caution, Mr. Lambeck said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of these [larger] projects are waiting for the economy to turn around," he said. "I think they are going to wait a little longer."</p>
