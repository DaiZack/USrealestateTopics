U.S. Government Bonds Pull Back; ISM soothes concerns over the U.S. economic outlook and sapped demand for haven assets</span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A broad wave of selling hit the <span class="companylink">U.S. government</span> debt market on Tuesday, sending the yield on the benchmark 10-year note to the highest level in nearly a month, as the latest economic indicators deflated worries that the world's largest economy was losing momentum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A monthly gauge of the manufacturing sector beat economists' forecasts[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/manufacturing-sector-show-signs-of-improvement-in-february-1456845493]. U.S. construction spending in January reached the highest level since 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reports drove investors to lighten up on haven debt holdings. A sign investors' appetites for risks improved, U.S. stocks gained[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/global-stocks-edge-higher-after-modestly-upbeat-session-in-asia-1456823572] by more than 2% and crude oil prices strengthened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The imminent recession fears in the U.S. have been overblown," said Christopher Sullivan, who manages $2.3 billion as chief investment officer at United Nations Federal Credit Union. “The most recent data has been rather good versus expectations and highlights the vulnerability of <span class="companylink">Treasury</span> bonds" after their sharp price gains since the start of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The yield on the benchmark 10-year <span class="companylink">Treasury</span> note closed at 1.835%, compared with 1.740% on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It marks the yield's highest closing level since Feb 5. Yields rise as bond prices fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors don't expect the data to be sufficient for the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> to raise rates when policy makers meet on March 15-16. But expectations that the Fed would be on hold this year have diminished and wagers betting on the Fed to raise rates later this year have increased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed-funds futures, used by investors and traders to place bets on central-bank policy, showed Tuesday that they see a 59% likelihood of a rate increase from the Fed at its December policy meeting, according to data from <span class="companylink">CME Group</span>. The probability was 12% a month ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher interest rates tend to dilute the value of outstanding bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The yield on the two-year note, highly sensitive to expected changes in the Fed's rate-policy outlook, settled at 0.849%, compared with 0.787% on Monday. The yield closed at the highest level since Jan. 25.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bond market has suffered a setback after posing a strong price gain since the start of the year. The 10-year yield had dipped below 1.6% in February as worries over the U.S. growth were heightened amid a large decline in global stocks and oil prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several releases over the past couple of weeks, including consumer and business spending, point to the resilience of the U.S. economy despite recent financial-market turmoil and weaker growth overseas. Meanwhile, inflation data suggested price pressure has started to rise from very low levels in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, the monthly manufacturing index from the <span class="companylink">Institute for Supply Management</span> was 49.5 in February. While the industry remains in contraction, the index bounced from 48.2 in January and beat the 48.6 forecast by economists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
John Briggs, head of strategy for Americas at RBS Securities, said the bond market has priced in “a lot of bad news" on the economy recently. Any sign of improvement in the U.S. data would generate selling pressure on bonds, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">U.S. Treasury</span> bond yields remain at very low levels from a historical standpoint. The 10-year yield traded at 2.273% at the end of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few investors expect bond yields to rise significantly soon. Many refrain from placing large negative wagers on bonds amid a muddy growth and inflation outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any setback from U.S. data release could stoke concerns over the U.S. growth momentum and boost demand for haven debt, say analysts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report earlier Tuesday showed China's official manufacturing purchasing managers index fell last month to its lowest level in more than four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, <span class="companylink">U.S. Treasury</span> bonds remain attractive for investors overseas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unconventional monetary policy adopted by Japan and a number of central banks in Europe has sent a growing number of global government bonds to yield below zero. <span class="companylink">U.S. Treasury</span> debt offers one of the highest yields in the developed world, attracting investors in Europe and Asia struggling to get income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors expect the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> to announce fresh monetary stimulus from its monetary-policy meeting March 10. Expectation of more policy easing has sent government-bond yields toward record lows over the past few weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The yield <span class="companylink">premium investors</span> demanded to hold the U.S. 10-year <span class="companylink">Treasury</span> note instead of the 10-year German bond was 1.68 percentage points on Tuesday, the highest level in nearly two months.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The number of existing homes tentatively sold across the U.S. fell in January, as swiftly rising prices and lower inventory muted buyer demand after the strongest year in nearly a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An index measuring pending home sales -- a gauge of purchases before they become final -- fell 2.5% to a seasonally adjusted reading of 106.0 in January, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Monday. An index of 100 is equal to the average level of contract activity during 2001, which the <span class="companylink">NAR</span> considers a "normal," or balanced, market for the current U.S. population. In 2015, the index averaged 108.9, a rise of 8% over 2014 and its highest level since 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While pending home sales have been weak lately, some other housing indicators -- including the mortgage purchase application data reported through most of February -- have looked strong, giving us hope that the housing market is continuing to recover," said Daniel Silver, an economist at <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending sales offer insight into the housing market's direction because they measure purchases at the time a contract is signed, rather than at closing. Contracts typically take weeks to become final, and some are ultimately canceled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historically, pending sales have tended to track sales of existing homes, although the latter figure has been choppier in recent months. Mr. Silver attributed that divergence "likely to a change in mortgage regulation, which appears to have impacted the existing home sales data more than the pending home sales data."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several economists noted January's blizzard may have damped activity in the Northeast, but the index fell most in the Midwest and Northwest, declining by 4.9% and 4.5% respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's possible that the drop in the stock market beginning at the start of the year persuaded would-be home buyers to wait a while, but we have no way of knowing for sure," said Ian Shepherdson, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. "Alternatively, the severe blizzard in late January might have depressed activity in the Northeast, but sales reportedly fell even further in the West, so it's hard to find a consistent story."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Art Patnaude   </div><div>441 words</div><div>29 February 2016</div><div>10:32</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices of new-build homes in central London are expected to fall this year, a sign of weakening demand for high-end developments around the U.K. capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes prices in new developments will drop 3% in 2016, according to real-estate broker JLL. In November, JLL said it expected prices to rise 1% this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop in prices stems from shrinking demand from global investors who are contending with stock-market shocks, a collapse in oil prices, and an impending U.K. tax hike on landlords and second-home owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These factors are “forcing JLL to reconsider price growth forecasts," the broker said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Central London property became one of the hottest global assets after the 2008 financial crisis, driven in part by a surge of demand from wealthy overseas buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, prices for high-end homes in prime locations fell amid weakened demand from global investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year slowing investor appetite will hit the high-end new-build market, JLL said. After prices fall this year, they are expected to remain flat in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the longer term, JLL said that the broad residential London market remains underpinned by a growing U.K. economy, strong employment levels, and expectations that the <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span> will keep interest rates low. It said prices would likely rise again in 2018 as a result.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The viability of some new developments will be directly affected by the weaker demand, JLL said. New-build development relies on selling apartments to investors before construction starts, as it allows the companies to generate cash and open up financing options.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From April, the so-called stamp duty charge for landlords and second-home buyers will rise by 3% of the sale price. The <span class="companylink">U.K. government</span> announced the change last November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With investors balking at the new tax, the government “has directly undermined its own priority to boost housing supply," said Andrew Frost, head of residential at JLL. “Furthermore, the change has made higher-density schemes demonstrably more risky."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside central London, demand for new residential development is expected to remain stronger, JLL said. In these areas, prices are expected “to remain broadly flat, provided that developers adjust expectations to suit this new market condition," said Adam Challis, head of residential research at JLL, in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average London house price was £530,409 in January, up nearly 14% from a year earlier, according to the Land Registry.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending sales offer insight into the housing market's direction because they measure purchases at the time a contract is signed, rather than at closing. Contracts typically take weeks to become final, and some are ultimately canceled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historically, pending sales have tended to track existing home sales, although the latter figure has been choppier in recent months. Mr. Silver attributed that divergence “likely to a change in mortgage regulation, which appears to have impacted the existing home sales data more than the pending home sales data."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending home sales rose 1.4% in January from a year earlier, the 17th straight month the index has increased year over year, but that was its second-smallest annual gain over that period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several economists noted January's blizzard may have dampened activity in the Northeast, but the index fell most in the Midwest and Northwest, declining by 4.9% and 4.5% respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's possible that the drop in the stock market beginning at the start of the year persuaded would-be home buyers to wait a while, but we have no way of knowing for sure," said Ian Shepherdson, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, in a note to clients. “Alternatively, the severe blizzard in late January might have depressed activity in the northeast, but sales reportedly fell even further in the West, so it's hard to find a consistent story."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, the NAR's chief economist, attributed the slowdown to “the recent acceleration in home prices and minimal inventory throughout the country."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">NAR</span> reported last week that its more closely watched index—final sales of existing homes, measuring purchases after closing—rose 0.4% in January [http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-nahb-housing-index-falls-to-lowest-level-since-may-1455634802]from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.47 million, the fastest sales pace since July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But new home sales, which make up around 10% of sales, dropped 9.2% in January[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-new-home-sales-fell-sharply-in-january-1456326292], the lowest rate since October and 5.2% lower than January a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has been a relative bright spot in the U.S. economy, supported by continued low interest rates and a strengthening labor market. Residential fixed investment contributed slightly more than a quarter of a percentage point to GDP growth in 2015, and existing home sales had their best year since 2006. But home builders have reported shortages of construction workers and land. And home-price gains, particularly in some economically vibrant metro areas, have been outstripping wage growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Blitz, an economist at ITG Investment Research, warned of “Sagging growth rates for consumer spending, now including existing homes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In line with other consumer spending data, the peak year-over-year growth rate for pending home sales seem to have been reached early in 2015," he wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">NAR</span> also released its annual revisions for 2013 through 2015.

An index of 100 is equal to the average level of contract activity during 2001, which the <span class="companylink">NAR</span> considers a “normal," or balanced, market. In 2015, the index averaged 108.9, a rise of 8% over 2014 and its highest level since 2006. December's reading was revised up to 108.7 from an initial reading of 106.8.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending sales offer insight into the housing market's direction because they measure purchases at the time a contract is signed, rather than at closing. Contracts typically take weeks to become final, and some ultimately are canceled.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gold rose Monday as U.S. economic data disappointed investors and China announced further stimulus measures intended to revive its flagging growth rate, burnishing the safe-haven luster of precious metals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gold futures settled 1.1% higher at $1,234.40 a troy ounce on the <span class="companylink">New York Mercantile Exchange</span>. Gold futures have surged more than 16% this year amid global financial market volatility and concerns that growth is slowing around the globe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors were surprised by a larger-than-expected drop in a measure of Midwest business activity, with the Chicago purchasing manufacturers' index falling to 47.6[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/chicago-pmi-tumbles-in-february-1456759408] from 55.6 a month ago, compared with an expected decline to 52. A reading below 50 indicates contraction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And pending home sales in the U.S. slumped 2.5% in January[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-pending-home-sales-tumbled-2-5-in-january-1456758035], falling at a time when economists expected a 0.5% gain. Buyers blanched at rising home prices and lower inventories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weak data added to a growing body of concerning indicators since the start of the year that the U.S. economy is slowing, a typical driver for investor interest in havens such as gold. Though stocks have begun to recover from their swoon to start the year, the data could suggest more trouble lies ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There's a lack of central bank confidence around the world," said Bill Baruch, a market strategist at brokerage iiTrader in Chicago. “There's a lack of faith in this equity market rally."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, in China, central bankers took new steps to shore up the country's economy in the face of growing evidence that its economic boom is slowing. The People's Bank of China lowered the yuan against the dollar[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/china-cuts-reserve-requirement-for-banks-1456741479] for the fifth consecutive trading session Monday, and announced it was easing the requirement[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/china-cuts-reserve-requirement-for-banks-1456741479] for bank capital reserves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gold's gain Monday was unusual, rising in tandem with other risk markets such as stocks, which shook off early losses in response to the downbeat U.S. data to turn higher. With Monday's gain, gold prices notched a 10.6% gain for the month of Feburary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Gold has done extremely well today, in spite of better stocks, in spite of a stronger dollar," said George Gero, a senior vice president at RBC Capital Markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data from the <span class="companylink">Commodity Futures Trading Commission</span> showed that speculators increased their net long position by 32%, to 124,000 lots last week. That extends hedge funds' bullish run to eight weeks of buying, the longest streak since 2012, noted Ole Hansen, head of Commodity Strategy at <span class="companylink">Saxo Bank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The gold buying frenzy continues," Mr. Hansen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors will be closely watching the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s policy meeting later this month for signs about the direction of the U.S. economy and the central bank's plans for raising interest rates, which could impact demand for safe haven assets like gold. When rates rise, demand for gold typically falls because yield-bearing securities like Treasurys become more attractive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's just really a question of what they say," said Graham Leighton, a broker at Marex Spectron. “If they continue to be a little dovish, then the price can remain strong. If they make any kind of hawkish overtones, then we can probably see a little bit of the strength taken out of gold."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other precious metal markets, silver rose 1.4% to settle at $14.92 an ounce, platinum rose 2.1% to $934.30 an ounce and palladium rose 2.7% to $495.65 an ounce</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartment construction has been a bright spot in an otherwise lackluster recovery of the nation's housing market over the last six years. Now economists say the tide might be turning away from apartments and toward single-family homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each year since 2010, construction of apartments and condominiums has grown at a faster rate than single-family homes. Last year U.S. builders began construction on 396,600 units in buildings with two units or more, the most in a year since 1988.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family home construction, while a bigger chunk of the market overall, has remained far below historical averages. Single-family construction represented about two-thirds of new residential building last year, a share that has fallen from more than 80% a decade earlier. Last year single-family housing starts came in at 714,600, significantly lower than the previous 20-year average of about 1.05 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But 2016 could bring a reversal of these trends, economists said. Forecasts from the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> and housing-research firm Metrostudy suggest the apartment boom might be cooling off as construction of single-family homes ticks up. Metrostudy projects growth of 14.6% for single-family starts this year and 5.4% for multifamily. The <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> is predicting single-family growth of 19%, compared with 2% for multifamily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both forecasts draw on long-run demographic and labor market trends, along with factors such as labor and construction costs. Metrostudy's data also incorporates detailed on-the-ground surveys of lot development across the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">U.S. Census Bureau</span> this week will release monthly construction spending data, which will offer an indication of the trajectory for residential building. Six years of rapidly rising rents across the U.S. have driven prices to a point that is out of reach for many, far outpacing income growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There have been predictions of a reversal before. Last year the <span class="companylink">NAHB</span> forecast 26% growth for single-family construction and only 2% for multifamily. Instead, single-family construction grew at a rate of 10.3%, compared with 11.6% for multifamily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the single-family market picks up its pace, economists said there are still inherent challenges -- tough lending standards, student debt and delayed household formation -- that will inhibit a bigger surge.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Katy McLaughlin   </div><div>447 words</div><div>26 February 2016</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M16</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2016, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Los Angeles' luxury market is blazing -- and it has nothing to do with droughts or fires. Median sale prices of single-family homes increased by 37% in Beverly Hills and 12% in Bel Air and Holmby Hills in 2015 compared with the year before, according to Jonathan Miller, a real-estate appraiser who prepares market reports for brokerage <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in this heady market, some deals stand out. Josh Flagg, executive sales director at Rodeo Realty, sold three houses on behalf of clients last year -- twice. In each instance, he sold the homes the second time for roughly $1 million more than the first time -- even though no or few improvements were made to the properties, according to Mr. Flagg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate experts cite a number of factors behind the sales and quick resales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow chief economist Svenja Gudell suspects the properties were marketed to developers, who will either fully renovate or raze and rebuild the homes at an even greater profit. "We see in the public record that some of these are trusts that sold to [limited-liability corporations]," Ms. Gudell says. "That can mean families selling to developers. Developers are often more focused on timing and getting the exact property they want, which can make them less sensitive to price."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Flagg said the buyers of the Tower Lane and Tower Grove Drive properties were developers. He declined to disclose the names of any of the buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Habibi, professor of real estate at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate also cites economic forces at work: "As the dollar strengthened last year, you saw foreign money get increasingly desperate to park itself into American assets," he says. "It's creating a bit of a frenzy, with lots of cash and people bidding up prices. People from out of town are never going to get the best deals, because they don't have the insider knowledge of the market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Flagg has his own explanation for the seven-figure flips: "It's the market and the intimate knowledge I have of the L.A. market."</p>

<span class="companylink">Sino Land</span>'s</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash Helps</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a Crunch</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A housing price collapse is brewing in Hong Kong, but many developers in one of the world's most expensive property markets are trading like the crash has already taken place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Sino Land</span>, controlled by the family of Singaporean tycoon Robert Ng, is one of those. It trades at half of its book value, near the same level it traded during the financial crisis in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the developer appears to be built for just such a hard landing, with $2.5 billion on its balance sheet, about 29% of its market value, according to its results issued Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hong Kong housing prices have fallen around 10% in the past few months, and could be set for a steeper drop as China's economy slows and U.S. rates rise. <span class="companylink">Sino Land</span>'s cash cushion should give investors some protection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cash pile also means <span class="companylink">Sino Land</span> can gobble up cheap land or projects when home prices do collapse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And around half of its profit comes from rental properties, which won't be immune to a downturn, but nonetheless are a more stable source of income stream than building and selling apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company has also been returning part of its cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. It has a respectable dividend yield of 4.7%. Given its cash holdings, the payout should be safe even when the property market worsens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hong Kong's exorbitant home prices may come back to earth, but <span class="companylink">Sino Land</span> is best positioned to withstand the ride over the long term.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China Bond Access Brings Risks</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a yield-starved world, China's freshly cracked bond market seems like an enticing opportunity. But investors would do well to tread fearfully.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China announced Wednesday a lifting of restrictions on foreign involvement in its massive domestic bond market, making it easier for institutional investors to buy Chinese bonds. The changes include eliminating an $80 billion overall quota on foreign investment through one prominent program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beijing has portrayed the opening as an effort to conform with <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span> standards and to open China's financial system to market forces. Those are valid and welcome. But the nearer-term reality is that China simply needs the cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Capital outflows have been immense in recent months. And China is talking of giving the economy a boost by raising this year's fiscal deficit to 4% of gross domestic product, which incremental flows from the rest of the world could help finance. China starts from a low base in that regard, with only about 2% of the bond market owned by foreigners, according to <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In theory, the opening-up could bring massive inflows. Consider that two-year government debt yields 2.46%, compared with 0.71% on two-year <span class="companylink">U.S. Treasury</span> bonds and negative yields on Japanese and European bonds. And the value of existing Chinese bonds could increase as China is likely to ease monetary policy further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reward from plunging into China's bond market right now, however, may not be worth the risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The opening comes just as the market is expanding at an alarmingly fast pace. The corporate-bond market, newly opened to already indebted sectors such as real estate, has swelled 60% in two years to over $2 trillion. Government-debt supply also should stay strong with stimulus spending on the rise and a local government debt-for-bond swap program expected to expand this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having experienced only a few token defaults, Chinese bond investors have no baseline for assessing risk. Buying appears indiscriminate and momentum-driven.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, last year's stock-market bubble may have simply morphed into a bond-market bubble. Despite the swollen corporate-bond supply, slowing growth and declining corporate profits, yield spreads have compressed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That the Shanghai Composite fell 6.4% the day after the bond-market announcement is a reminder of the volatility China can drum up. Beijing may have opened its bond market, but it has a long way to go to feel the world's warm embrace.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For <span class="companylink">Chesapeake Energy</span>, Hope Is the Strategy</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a price for everything even beleaguered <span class="companylink">Chesapeake Energy</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The No. 2 U.S. natural-gas producer's shares still are down by over 90% since mid-2014, but that includes a nearly 70% surge in its shares since the beginning of last week as bankruptcy fears have ebbed. While the status quo is clearly unsustainable, the bounce makes sense: Management has bought valuable time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That sentiment was underscored Wednesday when the company reported 2015 results. True, a 53% drop in revenue and a loss of almost $15 billion look bad, but Chesapeake has taken bold steps to remain solvent and service a huge debt load racked up by its former boss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent ones include suspending dividends last summer to conserve $240 million annually, selling assets, conserving $170 million from axing preferred stock dividends, renegotiating service contracts and swapping second-lien debt for outstanding issues in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the beginning of 2015 a net $2.2 billion in debt was retired with an annual interest reduction of $38 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That alone isn't enough. Chesapeake's adjusted net leverage fell by a mere $430 million in 2015. Even with an impressive effort to rein in costs, oil and natural-gas prices are much too low for Chesapeake to remain viable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company upped plans for divestitures and has cut investments to the bone in 2016. That, and an untapped credit line of $4 billion, should allow Chesapeake to survive 2016, even including a hefty legal settlement for a botched 2013 debt buyback.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After that, though perhaps by 2017 debt service may become overwhelming. The reason for the stock's bounce is that a lot still can happen on the corporate front or in commodity markets between now and then. Correctly figuring the slim odds of a marked recovery are key to valuing Chesapeake today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whoever said hope isn't a strategy wasn't in the oil-and-gas business.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sharp's bungled sale is turning into a master class in chaotic deal making.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday the Japanese tech giant was meant to put the final touches on a nearly $6 billion deal to sell a majority chunk in itself to Hon Hai, the Taiwanese assembler of iPhones. That something was wrong became clear after Sharp put out a news release announcing the sale midday Tokyo time. Its share price plunged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the reason might have been that the deal terms Sharp unveiled were different than what had leaked to the media. More of Hon Hai's offer than expected was to be exchanged for common equity, diluting existing Sharp shareholders. Hon Hai would buy fewer of the preferred shares held by Japanese banks, meaning equity holders would have the preferred coupon payments to stand in front of.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another troubling signal was that Hon Hai didn't confirm the deal right away. Instead, several hours later, it said the marriage was on hold. The reason: The day before the deal was supposed to be signed, Sharp presented Hon Hai with a 100-point list of contingent liabilities totaling 350 billion yen ($3.1 billion) or 100 billion yen more than Sharp's market capitalization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last-minute hitches are common. But the embarrassment of Sharp's putting out an official deal statement only to be essentially contradicted by Hon Hai will have raised substantial ill will that both sides will have to overcome. Hon Hai says it is committed to doing the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Innovation Network Corp. of Japan</span>, which came in second in the bidding, had even put out a statement wishing Sharp well. It should now start dusting off its deal book.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fell 9.2% Last Month</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of newly built homes slid to start the year, showing that a foundation for recent economic growth may be on soft footing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of new single-family homes dropped 9.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 494,000 in January, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. It was the slowest pace for sales since October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This report is a reminder that . . . the housing recovery remains a bumpy one," said Oxford Economics economist Gregory Daco. "While we see solid fundamentals supporting housing activity in 2016, we note that the decline in prices and increase in inventories, if they persist, could indicate deteriorating private-sector confidence."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were 238,000 new homes for sale at the end of January. That was the largest inventory since October 2009. The median sales price of new homes was $278,800 last month, down from $292,000 a year earlier.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is Cleared by Court</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Texas' highest criminal court tossed the second and final felony charge against former Gov. Rick Perry on Wednesday, likely ending a case the Republican says helped sink his short-lived 2016 presidential bid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals dismissed the abuse-of-power charge, which was filed after Mr. Perry threatened -- and then carried out -- a veto of state funding for a group of public-corruption prosecutors after the Democratic head of the unit refused to resign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its 6-2 ruling, the court said veto power can't be restricted by the courts and the prosecution of a veto "violates separations of powers." A lower appeals court had dismissed the other charge, coercion by a public servant, in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite his legal problems, Mr. Perry in June said he was running for president. He dropped out of the race in September.</p>

Los Angeles' luxury market [http://www.wsjplus.com/invites/video-recap-la-real-estate]is blazing—and it has nothing to do with droughts or fires. Median sale prices of single-family homes increased by 37% in Beverly Hills and 12% in Bel Air and Holmby Hills in 2015 compared with the year before, according to Jonathan Miller, a real-estate appraiser who prepares market reports for brokerage <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in this heady market, some deals stand out. Josh Flagg, executive sales director at Rodeo Realty, sold three houses on behalf of clients last year—twice. In each instance, he sold the homes the second time for roughly $1 million more than the first time—even though no or few improvements were made to the properties, according to Mr. Flagg.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate experts cite a number of factors behind the sales and quick resales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow chief economist Svenja Gudell suspects the properties were marketed to developers, who will either fully renovate or raze and rebuild the homes at an even greater profit. “We see in the public record that some of these are trusts that sold to [limited-liability corporations]," Ms. Gudell says. “That can mean families selling to developers. Developers are often more focused on timing and getting the exact property they want, which can make them less sensitive to price."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Flagg said the buyers of the Tower Lane and Tower Grove Drive properties were developers. He declined to disclose the names of any of the buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Habibi, professor of real estate at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate also cites economic forces at work: “As the dollar strengthened last year, you saw foreign money get increasingly desperate to park itself into American assets," he says. “It's creating a bit of a frenzy, with lots of cash and people bidding up prices. People from out of town are never going to get the best deals, because they don't have the insider knowledge of the market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Flagg has his own explanation for the seven-figure flips: “It's the market and the intimate knowledge I have of the L.A. market."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Eric Morath   </div><div>598 words</div><div>24 February 2016</div><div>11:54</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Sales of newly built homes slid to start the year, showing a foundation for recent economic growth may be on soft footing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of new single-family homes decreased by 9.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 494,000 in January, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. It was the slowest pace for sales since October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reading came in well below expectation of economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal for a January sales pace of 525,000. From a year earlier, sales were down 5.2% in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This report is a reminder that...the housing recovery remains a bumpy one," said Oxford Economics economist Gregory Daco. “While we see solid fundamentals supporting housing activity in 2016, we note that the decline in prices and increase in inventories, if they persist, could indicate deteriorating private-sector confidence."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were 238,000 new homes for sale at the end of January. That was the largest inventory since October 2009. The median sales price of new homes was $278,800 last month, down from $292,000 a year earlier. Price data isn't seasonally adjusted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, new home sales data is notoriously choppy. January's percentage decline comes with a margin of error of plus or minus 13.5 percentage points. Most economists focus on longer-run trends, which still show modest growth for the sector that represents about 10% of all home purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales last year reached the highest level since 2007, the year the recession began, showing the housing market to be a bright spot for the economy. That contrasted with slowdowns in manufacturing, exporting and energy production.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The monthly numbers are watched because sales of newly built homes support construction jobs, raw-material purchases and other aspects of the economy more so than sales of previously owned properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest reading is another sour note for the economy early this year. Consumer confidence fell in February, the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> said this week; job creation slowed and financial markets have been unsettled much of this year. If Americans grow jittery about the economic expansion's durability, housing sales could slump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But sales of previously owned homes are growing at a steady rate, increasing 0.4% in January from December, and rising 11% from a year earlier, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising incomes, sustained job gains and low interest rates should all support home sales. The interest rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 3.87% in January, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. Rates have held at historically low levels for several years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's report showed there was a 5.8 months' supply of newly built homes in January, based on the current sales pace. That was up from 5.1 months in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales last month plunged 32.1% in the West and declined 5.9% in the Midwest. Sales grew modestly in the Northeast and the South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The sharp drop in sales in the West region may have been driven by poor weather, as regional precipitation was at least 3 inches above the normal seasonal pattern in January," said Barclays economist Jesse Hurwitz. “We expect new-home sales to trend higher as the gradual recovery in housing continues."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Healthy home sales last month kept the U.S. housing recovery on track, though fast-rising prices and jitters about the broader economy could crimp buyer demand in the coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes, which account for the bulk of homebuying activity, rose 0.4% in January from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.47 million, the fastest sales pace since July, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists had expected sales would dip last month, so "the fact that there was any increase at all is a positive sign for home sales," said Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist at real estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. McLaughlin said he wouldn't be surprised to see sales soften in the coming months. Worries about the economy dented consumer confidence this month, including a drop in the number of people saying they planned to buy a home in the next six months, according to a <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> survey released Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report Tuesday underscored concerns that tight inventory is driving up home prices and making it difficult for buyers to get into the market. The S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index, covering the entire nation, rose 5.4% in the 12 months ended in December, greater than its 5.2% increase in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, a number of housing experts had expected price growth to slow, as buyers reached the limit of what they can afford. But recent indicators suggest that buyers are unlikely to get relief soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The takeaway is that prices have a little bit further to rise," said Nela Richardson, chief economist at Redfin, a Web-based real-estate company. "There are some tailwinds behind prices because supply is so low."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said there were 1.82 million existing homes available for sale at the end of January, down 2.2% from a year earlier and a 4-month supply at the current sales pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price growth remains a key variable for the housing outlook. The hottest markets in the country, primarily on the West Coast, continued to show double-digit price gains, with Portland, Ore., reporting an 11.4% year-over-year increase, followed by San Francisco with a 10.3% increase and Denver with a 10.2% jump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Month-over-month price gains were modest, giving some indication that momentum may slow heading into 2016. Seasonally adjusted, Miami had lower prices this month than last and 10 other cities saw smaller increases in December compared with November, according to Case-Shiller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are likely buoyed by low mortgage rates. The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage last week was 3.65%, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, compared with 4.01% at the end of December.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Peter Grant   </div><div>797 words</div><div>23 February 2016</div><div>13:57</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A venture of a private-equity firm and Middle East investor has purchased Saint-Gobain SA's North American headquarters near Philadelphia in a $123 million deal that shines some light on how this year's turmoil in the global capital markets is affecting commercial real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">London-based 90 North Real Estate Partners LP and a unit of Arzan Financial Group of Kuwait bought the 65-acre corporate campus in Malvern, Pa., leased by the global manufacturer of building material. The deal comes as concern grows that the bull market that has dominated the commercial property world for much of the recovery may be coming to an end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the 90 North-Arzan venture took comfort that <span class="companylink">Saint-Gobain</span> signed a 15-year lease for the entire 320,000-square-foot office facility on the campus, which includes a pond and walking trails. Founded 350 years ago to manufacture glass for the Palace of Versailles, <span class="companylink">Saint-Gobain</span> officially opened the facility in October after it was upgraded with company products so it can be used as a customer showcase.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We know the (market) sentiment is fragile," said Daniel Cooper, head of 90 North's operations in North America. “But investors want the income generation they can't get from other investments and they want something with capital preservation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial property has been hot until recently, with sales volume and values rising in many parts of the world. In the U.S., sales hit a post-crash record of $541 billion last year, up from $432 billion in 2014, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>. An index of values of top class commercial property compiled by <span class="companylink">Green Street Advisors</span> was at a record 123 in January, unchanged from December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But repercussions from the selloff in global stock and corporate bond markets have been felt in real estate, fueling investor anxiety. Shares of real estate investment trusts have fallen further than broader market averages while bonds backed by commercial mortgages have weakened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. commercial property sales volume in January was $44.1 billion, according to preliminary data from Real Capital. That is down from January 2015 when $47.8 billion traded hands, Real Capital said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts remain bullish. They point out that so far occupancy rates and rents show no sign of falling; foreign investors continue to have a strong appetite for property and interest rates remain low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, some question whether prices can go up much further given their sharp rise in recent years. <span class="companylink">Green Street Advisors</span> is projecting that U.S. property values will decline by as much as 5% this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“To say there are mixed messages out there is an understatement," said Douglas Harmon, senior managing director of Eastdil Secured, one of the country's leading sales brokerages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts say that while deals continue, sellers are showing a new willingness to cut their prices a bit to push transactions over the finish line. Some buyers are steering clear of riskier properties that need a lot of improvement or face large lease expirations in the near future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers are also becoming less likely to get involved in bidding wars. “I am not getting as aggressive," said Mr. Cooper of 90 North. “It's kind of like we may have reached the peak here."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Malvern campus, which includes two buildings, originally was developed in 1968 as the headquarters for National Liberty Life Insurance Co. Between 1997 and 2008 it was occupied by the U.S. unit of Aegon NV. Arzan and 90 North bought it from a venture of Aegon and local developers E. Kahn Development Corp. and J. Loew &amp; Associates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Founded in 2011, 90 North works primarily with investors from the Middle East and Malaysia and has more than $1.22 billion of assets under management. The firm opened its U.S office in 2014 and since then has bought about $355 million worth of property here focusing on fully leased properties like the one in Malvern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 90 Worth-Arzan venture borrowed about 60% of the sales price from Santander Bank and Citizens Bank, of Louisville, Ky. The deal was structured so that it complies with Islamic code, known as Shariah law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property's income is equivalent to about a 5.8% yield on the sale price and the investors in the deal will be getting a leveraged return of more than 8%, Mr. Cooper said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Julia Roberts Lowers Price of Kauai</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beachfront Estate to $21.95 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Julia Roberts is lowering the price of her Hawaii home a second time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The actress's oceanfront property on Kauai's North Shore will now be listed at $21.95 million, down from $26 million, according to listing agent Neal Norman of Hawai'i Life Real Estate Brokers. The property first went on the market in the spring of 2015 for $29.85 million, then saw its price cut to $26 million in August of 2015. Ms. Roberts bought the home in 2011 for $13.4 million, according to public records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2-acre property is one of the largest on Hanalei Bay, with about 215 feet of beachfront as well as mountain views, Mr. Norman said. The modest main house has five bedrooms and measures about 3,790 square feet, he said. The home has a covered patio overlooking the bay. There is also a two-bedroom guest cottage on the property, where a large yard leads to the beach. Ms. Roberts loved the camp-like feel of the property, Mr. Norman said, but is selling because her family didn't use it often enough. Ms. Roberts didn't respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of sales in the Kauai real-estate market is still slower than the boom years of the mid-2000s, Mr. Norman said. "There is no real urgency in the market," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mini-Me: Replica of the White HOuse in Texas Seeks $6 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump should make a pit stop in a small town in southern Texas, where a smaller replica of the White House is going on the market for $5.9 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The waterfront mansion is in Morgan's Point, a small community of a few hundred people on Galveston Bay, roughly 25 miles outside Houston. The limestone house was built in the 1920s by one-term Texas Gov. Ross Sterling, according to owner Marcos Masson, an orthopedic surgeon. At roughly 21,000 square feet, this version is smaller than the real thing, which measures about 55,000 square feet. But the round, columned portico flanked by two sets of stairs and topped with a flagpole resembles the South Portico at the White House.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While also grand, the inside of the nine-bedroom, 15-bathroom house bears little resemblance to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. A 43-foot-long great room overlooking the bay has dual staircases and separate ladies' and gentlemen's parlors, each with a powder room. There is a library and a ballroom. On the lower level, there is a recreation area with a gym, a media room, billiards room, children's play area and a canning kitchen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Masson said he bought the house and its roughly 6 acres about three years ago for $3.2 million and spent about $1.5 million to extensively renovate it. He also brought in sand and palm trees to create a small private beach on the bay. Dr. Masson said he's selling because he wants to increase his cash flow for other projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Cheri Fama of John Daugherty Realtors, the firm listing the property, said this is by far the most expensive home on the market in Morgan's Point, where sales over $1 million are rare. "This is the grandest home ever built in Morgan's Point," she said. The listing agents are John Daugherty Realtors' Lin E. Neese and Chris Foster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Disco Ball in the Bathroom:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whimsical West Village</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Townhouse Seeks $26 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">British technology entrepreneur Jos White is listing his 19th-century Manhattan townhouse, which includes whimsical design details like a disco ball in the master bathroom, for $26 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the West Village, the red-brick house has four bedrooms plus staff quarters and measures about 4,700 square feet, with a garden, roof deck and two terraces, according to Jan Hashey of <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</span>, who has the listing with colleagues Steve Halprin and Leslie Mason.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A powder room's wallpaper incorporates photos of the family, and a seating area off the kitchen has a green banquette and a neon sign intended to resemble a diner. A hand crank opens and closes an angled wall of windows in Mr. White's home office, providing access to the roof deck. The master suite's decor includes a stuffed peacock. The couple wanted to make sure the house's design didn't "take itself too seriously," said Mr. White's wife, Annabel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, Mr. White's company MessageLabs was purchased by <span class="companylink">Symantec</span> for about $700 million; the next year he and his wife purchased this home for $7.25 million and spent about three years extensively renovating it, Ms. White said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Whites are selling because they've decided to move back to England, where they're renovating a house in London. The furnishings could be sold separately if a buyer is interested, Ms. White said. The couple haven't yet decided whether the peacock will be available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beverly Hills Estate of 'Godfather' Singer Martino Is Sold</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The longtime Beverly Hills home of the late crooner Al Martino has found a buyer, according to his wife Judi Martino.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Martino said the house was on the market for a few days before she accepted an offer for close to the home's $7.999 million asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Originally built in the 1920s, the five-bedroom house measures about 5,500 square feet, according to Mary Brill of John Aaroe Group, who has the listing with her daughter Jane Brill Gavens. The property also includes a one-bedroom guesthouse, which Mr. Martino used as a rehearsal space, his wife said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Martino died in 2009 at age 82. He bought the house in the late 1960s, around the time he and Ms. Martino were married, his wife said. Mr. Martino gained fame through a string of hits like "Spanish Eyes" in the 1950s and '60s, and is perhaps best known for playing the singer Johnny Fontane in the "Godfather" movies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home was briefly on the market in 2014 for $6.5 million and got several offers, Ms. Brill said, but Ms. Martino changed her mind about selling. The higher asking price was justified by the fact that "the market's changed," Ms. Brill said, noting that there is now a shortage of inventory in Beverly Hills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Martino, 72, said she is now planning to move to a luxury condo building in West Hollywood, where her daughter lives. "It will be hard to walk away, but it's time," she said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. industries ramped up production in January as strong car sales helped buffer factories against a global economic slowdown, but the outlook remains muddled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial production -- a broad measure of everything made by manufacturers, mines and utilities -- jumped 0.9% in January from a month earlier, the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> said Wednesday. Production hadn't expanded by more than that in a single month since May 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The boost reflected a surge in electricity generation due to last month's cold weather, as well as higher manufacturing output to meet demand for new cars. But overall output has been declining over the past year, and it isn't clear whether the surge was a blip or the start of a broader rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"January was just a good month in a long string of weak or mediocre months, with no assurances that the January performance has any staying power or will not be offset by a weak February," IHS Global Insight economist Michael Montgomery said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the bounce, industries continued to operate far below their potential, keeping the economy in a sluggish state. Capacity use -- a measure of economic slack -- climbed seven-tenths of a point to 77.1%; in healthier expansions, it has run 80% and higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, last month's rebound could boost hopes that the manufacturing sector will weather the sharp drop in oil prices, the strong dollar, weak global demand and turbulence in the financial markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Output by manufacturers -- which accounts for two-thirds of all industrial output and is a harbinger of the economy's health -- grew 0.5% last month after falling 0.2% in each of the prior two months. The latest increase was due largely to the surge in auto production, though food output also rose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Utility production grew by 5.4% last month from December, as last month's cold and snow prompted increased electricity production. Mining production was flat from December and down nearly 10% from a year earlier as energy firms scale back in response to depressed oil prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists closely follow industrial production, along with measures of employment, retail sales and income, to gauge the economy's strength and whether a recession is near.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. economy grew at a yearly rate of 0.7% in the final three months of 2015, slower than the 2% pace in the third quarter and 3.9% in the second quarter. Economists expect growth to rebound in the current quarter, to a rate between 2% and 3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other economic news:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- The producer-price index, which measures the prices companies receive for goods and services, advanced 0.1% in January from the prior month, the Labor Department said Wednesday. Excluding volatile food and energy categories, core prices climbed 0.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index has been firming since November as the cost of services rise, but it still remains historically weak. Overall producer prices were down 0.2% in January from a year earlier, the 12th straight year-over-year decline. Core pricesrose 0.6% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- U.S. housing starts fell 3.8% from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.099 million in January, the Commerce Department said Wednesday, the lowest rate since October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And new applications for building permits fell 0.2% to 1.202 million.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—New-home construction fell in January for a second straight month, as the housing market entered the new year with slowing momentum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. housing starts fell 3.8% from a month earlier[https://www-census-gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/construction/nrs/index.html] to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.099 million in January, the Commerce Department said Wednesday, the lowest rate since October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists split over whether this slowdown would continue or whether underlying fundamentals would boost the housing market come spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Fundamentals for housing demand are solid: job and wage gains, low mortgage rates, and pent-up demand after years of weak housing activity," said Gus Faucher, senior macroeconomist at <span class="companylink">PNC Financial Services Group</span>, in an analyst note. PNC forecasts a rate of 1.184 million housing starts in 2016, which would make it the best year since 2007. Oxford Economics estimates starts will climb even higher, to a rate of 1.27 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the downward tick in housing starts comes on the heel of softening home builder sentiment[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-nahb-housing-index-falls-to-lowest-level-since-may-1455634802]. U.S. home builders continue to report a positive outlook, but it dimmed slightly in February, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And new applications for building permits, a bellwether for forthcoming construction, edged down 0.2% to 1.202 million, from a downwardly revised December rate of 1.204 million, although they were up 13.5% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The weak showing in construction activity is broadly consistent with the recent souring in home builders' sentiment, and when combined with the downdrift in permit approvals it suggests some slowdown in the months ahead," said Millan Mulraine, economist at <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span> USA, in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starts on single-family homes, which account for roughly two-thirds of the market, fell to a rate of 731,000 from December's downwardly revised 761,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rate for multifamily units, which include apartments and condominiums, fell to 368,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected January housing starts to reach a rate of 1.18 million, and 1.20 million building permits to be issued.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-starts figures are volatile and often revised. Wednesday's report showed new-home starts revised down to 1.143 million in December, compared with an initial estimate of 1.149 million. Temperatures dropped in January and a major snowstorm hit the East Coast, slowing construction activity after a warmer-than-usual winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for housing has been strong over the past year, with starts up 10.8% in 2015 over 2014. But that momentum appears to have slowed slightly: Housing starts were just 1.8% higher for January over a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing has remained a bright spot in the U.S. economy, supported by historically low interest rates and ongoing job creation. But home builders are reporting shortages of land and labor, leading to delays in projects' completion. Those delays often serve to push prices up so the builder can recoup costs. Across the country, prices have climbed in many markets amid short supply, and construction levels for new homes remain historically low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soaring rents in hot job markets, especially in the West, have made a home purchase more appealing for those who can afford a down payment. But wage growth has been modest, making it harder for many would-be buyers to save for a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late January, the Commerce Department reported new-home sales rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 544,000 in December, up 9.9% from a year earlier[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-new-home-sales-rise-in-december-1453907132]. The January new-home sales data will be released Feb. 24, and pending home sales data will be released Feb. 29.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders' Confidence</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Housing Drops</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A gauge of home-builder sentiment fell in February to its lowest level since May, a sign that housing-market growth could be moderating amid rising prices and shortages of labor and land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An index of builder confidence in the market for new single-family homes fell three points to a seasonally adjusted level of 58 in February, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> said Tuesday. A reading over 50 means most builders generally see conditions as positive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Though builders report the dip in confidence this month is partly attributable to the high cost and lack of availability of lots and labor, they are still positive about the housing market," said NAHB Chairman Ed Brady.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index stood at an upwardly revised 61 in January, and 60 December. Ongoing upbeat sentiment in the housing market suggests it could maintain its strength in the face of headwinds, such as a relatively strong dollar and economic turmoil overseas, which have buffeted other sectors of the economy.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Auditors have reported finding unchecked squalor, including rodents, vermin, mold and fire hazards in New York homeless shelters, faulting inadequate state oversight.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We did identify numerous issues that rendered living conditions unacceptable at most of the shelters," they reported.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They found evidence of rodent and vermin infestations at 16 shelters, fire-safety issues at 15 shelters and mold in residents' rooms at eight shelters, as well as worn and soiled mattresses, missing carbon-monoxide detectors and holes in walls and ceilings.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Investors With Cash Edging Out First-Time Home Buyers; Easy pickings from foreclosures may be gone, but investors continue to swarm over housing markets</span>
</div><div class="author">By Joe Light </div><div>1017 words</div><div>16 February 2016</div><div>16:03</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the housing bust, investors pounced on foreclosures and short sales—houses that sell for less than the amount owed on the mortgage—to use for cheap homes they could rent out or flip for a quick profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, those easy pickings are gone, but the investors are still swarming over local housing markets, offering all-cash deals and creating headaches for the first-time home buyers who compete with them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regan Austin, 25 years old, and her husband lost out on an Orlando, Fla., area home earlier this year to an all-cash buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It was very disappointing. We had our heart set on that home," said Ms. Austin. She and her husband, who are first-time home buyers, are still looking. “We never thought of the concept of having a cash buyer come in and take that out from under you."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the housing bubble, investors, lured by easy mortgages, helped send home prices to record levels. In the crash that followed, investors appeared again, this time offering all-cash deals on thousands of bank-owned properties to sell or rent out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists and real-estate agents say the market is going through an uneasy transition. While the foreclosure starts rate is back down to where it was before the crisis, cash and investor buying in some cities remains far above historical levels. That creates difficulty for buyers of low-price homes because more buyers are competing for fewer properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October, 25% of home sales nationwide were to investors, down from a 32% peak in 2012, according to real-estate data firm <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> , but still 8 percentage points greater than in 2000, before the housing boom and bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the supply of homes for sale dwindled to 1.79 million in December, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> , enough to last 3.9 months at the current sales pace and well below the six months considered a normal market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem has become acute for buyers focused on low-price properties. According to the <span class="companylink">NAR</span> , between December 2014 and 2015 the number of homes for sale priced below $100,000 fell 11.1%, in part because of a decline in foreclosure sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Home supply is diminishing but investor demand is not going away," said NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists expect housing prices to cool over the coming year, and rather than try to flip homes for a profit, some investors say they are making a long-term bet on demand for rentals, which has boomed in many parts of the country. The <span class="companylink">U.S. Census Bureau</span> last month said 7% of rental units were vacant in the fourth quarter, near the low for the last decade and down from the peak of 11.1% in 2009. The median asking rent was $850, up 11% in the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some housing advocates say they have mixed feelings about the strong investor demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Low inventory is a problem and making sure first-time home buyers have a shot should be a priority. But on the other hand, we have a rental affordability crisis," said Sarah Edelman , director of housing policy for the left-leaning <span class="companylink">Center for American Progress</span> .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investor Ken Weiner, a former financial-services executive who lives in Wantagh, N.Y., didn't buy his first single-family rental property until November, but since then has closed with an investment partner on six homes and on another three on his own, including ones in South Carolina, Illinois and Georgia. He said he plans to close on at least another seven properties by mid-year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weiner, who is buying homes sight unseen through investor startup Home Union, said he thinks demand for rentals among millennials and others delaying homeownership will make investing in single-family homes a fixture of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I'm not counting on appreciation," he said. “If that comes, that's great. I'm looking for income."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some real-estate agents in cities that have seen their foreclosure crisis ease said investors have moved up from bank-owned properties and now are competing for traditional, low-price homes that normally would be fodder for first-time buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lisa C. Ford, secretary for the <span class="companylink">Orlando Regional Realtor Association</span>, said buyers there can expect to compete against at least one cash offer for any home priced below $300,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Orlando, 39% of sales in October were all-cash, according to the latest data available from <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> , down 5.6 percentage points from a year earlier but 23 percentage points greater than in 2006. Miami and West Palm Beach, Fla., also have seen declines but about half of homes there still sell for cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Don Ganguly, CEO of investor startup Home Union, has recently expanded the company's business to facilitate investor purchases in markets such as Columbia, S.C., and Huntsville, Ala., which some investors think could have strong rental demand despite little price appreciation recently. Some investors through the site are buying newly constructed homes directly from home builders, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cities still suffering from foreclosures, such as Newark, N.J., and New Orleans, cash purchases climbed in the past year through October, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> . Of the 100 largest metro areas, nearly all in the year through October saw the all-cash share of purchases fall, but only 10 have fewer all-cash sales than in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daniel Brown, an investor who lives outside Los Angeles, met with real-estate agents in Kansas City, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Pittsburgh and other cities looking for investment opportunities. He bought his first U.S. home in January 2015, and said he now owns about 60 homes with 75 units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“An average normal city goes through its ups and downs, but most people there need somewhere to live, and next year, they'll still need somewhere to live," said Mr. Brown.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Harriet Torry, Mike Cherney and Min Zeng   </div><div>1158 words</div><div>12 February 2016</div><div>21:25</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. consumers showed signs of strength in January, taking advantage of low oil prices to increase their spending and offering a welcome counterpoint to the gloom that has gripped investors and roiled markets since the start of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales at retail stores and restaurants rose 0.2% in January from the prior month, the Commerce Department said Friday. And December's retail sales were revised to a 0.2% gain instead of a drop, showing a better end to the year than initially estimated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase offers hope that the U.S. economy, which rests heavily on consumer outlays, can buck a slowdown in the global economy and power through a downturn in manufacturing. Investors cheered, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 313.66 points, or 2%, to 15973.84 in the largest gain this month; it remains down 8.3% for the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The retail-sales gains bolster a case that many analysts and economists have been making in recent weeks: While many financial-market gauges are raising concern about the health of the economy, ranging from the decline this year of broad stock indexes to the rise in corporate borrowing costs, direct measures of economic health such as home sales, employment and wages have been sending largely upbeat signals, suggesting that a U.S. expansion wrapping up its seventh year may not be as vulnerable as some fear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markets are forecasting a U.S. recession, “but I don't see that,'' said David Coard, head of fixed-income trading in New York at Williams Capital Group, a brokerage for institutional investors. “U.S. labor markets are still in good shape and we just started to see some wage pressure."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The retail news helped fuel a broad rally in financial markets Friday. U.S. crude oil rose 12.3% to $29.44 a barrel, its biggest one-day percentage gain since 2009. Prices are still down more than 20% this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank stocks, hit hard this year by declining global-growth expectations and fears that the negative-interest-rate policy adopted Jan. 29 in Japan points to a future of constrained profits, surged Friday. <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co</span>. rose 8.3%, <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>. rallied 7.1% and <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> added 6.5%. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index of large U.S. commercial lenders rose 5.4% Friday but is down 19% for 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, investors have been struggling to divine the relationship between falling oil prices and the broader market. Once thought an unalloyed good for the U.S. economy, the roughly 70% plunge in crude prices since 2014 has instead roiled markets by upending a major source of U.S. investment spending and employment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As well, consumers and businesses appear to be displaying considerable caution with energy savings, moving carefully on outlays and saving wherever possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the improvement in retail sales, while solid, remains far from spectacular after a plunge in gasoline prices that many economists expected would result in a surge in consumer spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors since have been scrounging for signs that low pump prices are spurring U.S. consumers to spend more at restaurants, retailers and elsewhere. Vasant Prabhu, the chief financial officer at payments firm <span class="companylink">Visa Inc</span>., said Tuesday that evidence of increased spending has been “spotty," but he still gave some cause for optimism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Consumers are now beginning to believe that these gas prices could stay low for longer, which would suggest that they may feel better about spending some of those savings," he said at the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending by consumers drives two-thirds of U.S. economic output, and household outlays have helped the economy grow in recent quarters despite a strong dollar and weak overseas growth, which have burdened U.S. exporters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers continued to spend less at gas stations thanks to lower fuel prices. But a core measure of retail sales excluding autos and gasoline posted a 0.4% increase. Americans stepped up spending across several major categories, including vehicles, groceries and building materials. Compared with a year earlier, sales grew 3.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With December's revision to retail sales, January marked the fourth consecutive month of gains and showed how American households remain relatively strong. “Despite the ongoing turmoil in global financial markets, consumer spending still managed to get off to a firm start" to the first quarter, said Richard Moody, chief economist at Regions Financial Corp.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The impact of a major snowstorm in the Northeast in January was less than feared, economists said. Wages rose and unemployment fell in the first month of the year, the Labor Department said last week, providing a strong foundation for spending growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While consumers appeared undeterred by the volatility in January, a sentiment reading out Friday indicated shoppers may be growing more nervous this month. The <span class="companylink">University of Michigan</span>'s preliminary February sentiment index dropped to 90.7 from 92.0 in January, which the surveyors attributed to a less favorable outlook for the economy this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That could point to caution in the months ahead, economists warned. Given financial-market uncertainty, growth in consumer outlays will remain contingent on the job market remaining strong and wages growing further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies have also warned about the impact of market jitters on shoppers recently. A number of companies that reported quarterly earnings this past week referred to the turbulent macroeconomic backdrop, but they said it has yet to have a pronounced impact on their bottom line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At <span class="companylink">Interpublic Group of Cos</span>., Chief Executive Michael Roth said advertisers haven't yet made significant changes to their ad spending despite the precarious environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The uncertainty we're all experiencing leads us to approach the new year with a degree of caution," Mr. Roth said on the company's earnings call Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Expedia Inc. Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi said during an earnings call this past week that some corporate clients are trying to save money by downgrading “from premium class to economy class or taking a train instead of taking a plane."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, Friday's reading on retail sales suggests consumers headed into 2016 on a relatively strong footing, welcome news for a <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> looking for evidence the U.S. economy is holding steady amid global uncertainty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a speech Friday, Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley described households as “in good shape." He said households look “much better positioned today than in 2008 to absorb shocks and continue to contribute to the economic expansion."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers boosted savings and slowed their spending in December, entering 2016 with a cautious stance amid market turmoil and a cloudy economic outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Incomes rose 0.3% during the month, the Commerce Department said Monday, but those extra earnings were socked away or used to pay down debt. The personal saving rate, or the share of income saved, rose to 5.5% from 5.3% a month earlier, matchinga three-year high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personal spending, which measures consumption on everything from sodas to haircuts, was flat in December from a month earlier. Spending climbed an upwardly revised 0.5% in November and was flat in October. Some of the spending weakness came from lower prices for staples such as gasoline and food, while utility bills were unseasonably low in December due to warm weather in much of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending on durable goods -- items designed to last at least three years -- fell 0.9%. Spending on nondurable goods, like clothing and food, fell the same amount. Instead, much of Americans' spending is going to essentials such as housing, medical care and education.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists expect spending to rise as the labor market firms and savings from low gas prices begin to feel permanent. "Income growth is still strong, employment growth is still strong and consumer confidence is still at healthy levels," saidPaul Ashworth, an economist at Capital Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Joshua Shapiro, an economist at MFR Inc., said Americans' inclination toward saving could reflect a populace "increasingly convinced that the political and economic systems of the nation are broken."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Derek Kravitz   </div><div>1162 words</div><div>1 February 2016</div><div>16:35</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crown Heights, the central Brooklyn neighborhood with an eclectic mix of ornate turn-of-the-century brownstones and ramshackle vacant warehouses, is trying to toe another line, between redevelopment and affordability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No place is that divide more on display than the Bedford-Union Armory, a former military site purchased by New York City in 2013. Earlier this month, the city said it would redevelop the castle-like building into apartments and a recreation center. As part of the plan, privately owned condos will stand side by side with 330 market-rate and affordable rental units, and the 45,000-square-foot center will occupy what was once a domed drill hall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Frankly, it was being used primarily as a catering hall. Now, it's a good reflection of the needs of Crown Heights," said Marty Markowitz, a former Brooklyn borough president who championed the armory project while in office. “Anything that can maximize allowing two civil servants being able to afford an apartment is a good thing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mayor Bill de Blasio's administration has sought to redevelop large portions of nearby East New York, citing Crown Heights and Bushwick as case studies in Brooklyn's red-hot housing market. Change has come to the neighborhood in fits and starts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For decades, Crown Heights was an upper-class enclave, characterized by its many brownstones along tree-lined Eastern Parkway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After World War II, waves of immigrants from Europe and the West Indies settled in the neighborhood. Race relations soured and Crown Heights became synonymous with crime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A low point came in 1991 when a three-day riot between Jewish and black residents left two dead and nearly 200 civilians and police officers injured. Dozens of storefronts were looted, and cars and homes were damaged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crime has been on the decline. In 1993, in the 77th police precinct, which includes Prospect Heights and Weeksville, there were 82 homicides; in 2015, there were 12.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But issues remain. The annual West Indian Day Parade along Eastern Parkway, which draws about a million people over four days, has been marred by violence in the past few years. During September's celebration, a man was fatally stabbed and an aide to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo was killed[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/cuomo-aide-shot-in-head-before-parade-dies-1442455959] by a stray bullet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There was a time that Crown Heights was the armpit of Brooklyn. When sundown hit, you couldn't venture out," said Frank Esquilin, president of the Crow Hill Community Association, a neighborhood residents' group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gentrification has taken hold of northwestern stretches of the neighborhood, along Franklin Avenue, which has caused mixed feelings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's infinitely safer, but a lot of people here can't afford gourmet delis and $20 pizzas," Mr. Esquilin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The demographics of Crown Heights, which has about 143,000 residents, according to census data, have changed drastically in the past decade. From 2000 to 2010, the number of non-Hispanic white residents nearly doubled while the black population fell by more than 13%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crown Heights attracts home buyers and renters looking to pay less than in Prospect Heights and Clinton Hill. The median sales price for one-bedroom apartments in Crown Heights is $652,000, according to real estate website StreetEasy.com, compared with $825,000 in Prospect Heights and $705,000 in Clinton Hill. The median price for one-bedroom rentals is $1,800 in Crown Heights, compared with $2,500 in Prospect Heights and $2,399 in Clinton Hill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, in a sign of the speed of the price increases in the Crown Heights housing market, median condo sales price has surged by 78% in the past year, to $698 a square foot in the third quarter of 2015, according to data from the Real Estate Board of New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parks: Several smaller parks dot the neighborhood, including Brower Park, on St. Mark's Avenue; St. John's Recreation Center, on Prospect Place; and Lincoln Terrace/Arthur S. Somers Park on Eastern Parkway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prospect Park, Brooklyn's largest green space at 526 acres, borders Crown Heights to the west.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Schools: District 17, which also encompasses Prospect Heights and East Flatbush, includes several grade, middle and high schools, including Pathways In Technology Early College High School, or P-TECH, which offers two years of college credit to eligible students, and the High School for Public Service: Heroes of Tomorrow; and Medgar Evers College Preparatory School.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, standardized test scores in the district tend to be lower than the citywide average. In 2015, 21.8% of students in grades three through eight were deemed proficient on the state English Language Arts exam, up from 17.1% in 2013. The citywide average for 2015 was 30.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2015, 16.5% of students in grades three through eight were deemed proficient on the state math exam, up from 12.6% in 2013. The citywide average for 2015 was 35.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private schools include Macademy and Mount Moriah Christian Academy, both offering preschool through middle school. Success Academy, Explore and Achievement First charter-school networks all have schools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Restaurants: A flurry of new eateries, offering everything from Neapolitan pizza to alligator burgers on brioche buns, have opened in the past few years. Longtime favorites include Tom's Restaurant, a diner that brings out long lines on weekends; Chavela's, a Mexican cantina known for its smoked-trout-and-chipotle-salsa guacamole; and the Islands, which serves Caribbean food, including oxtail and jerk chicken.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shopping and Entertainment: Grocery stores, boutique shoes and mom-and-pop shops can be found along Franklin and Washington avenues. The annual West Indian Day Parade, held on Labor Day weekend every September, celebrates residents' Caribbean heritage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the borough's most famous cultural institutions are nearby. The <span class="companylink">Brooklyn Children's Museum</span> is near Brower Park and the Jewish Children's Museum is near the Kingston Avenue subway stop. And the <span class="companylink">Brooklyn Botanic Garden</span>, the Brooklyn Museum and the Central Library at Grand Army Plaza are all a stone's throw away.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a time of jittery markets and uncertain prospects world-wide, the U.S. and Britain have still managed to end the year posting the strongest economic growth among major advanced countries, helped by consumer spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a warning sign has emerged in the U.K, whose growth now stands on a far flimsier footing: Households are once again spending more than they earn. Among developed countries, only Canada is in a similar place. Both summon memories of an imbalance that brought the global economy real pain in the latest financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And again, high home values are mainly to blame.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rapidly rising property prices are fueling a belief among homeowners that they can bulk up on debt. This is a risky move because money in real estate can't be quickly drawn upon in times of need, which means small economic slumps are more prone to be transformed into larger declines in consumption if people become overly worried about their cash needs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since reaching a postcrisis low in 2012, British house prices have risen by 21% and are back at 2006 levels after discounting inflation, according to the <span class="companylink">Bank for International Settlements</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">British household debt, which was reduced significantly after the 2008 crash, is now rising again as a share of disposable income. Savings rates in the U.K. are at record lows, while credit to consumers is growing at the fastest pace since the crisis. U.K. households ran a deficit in the third quarter that amounts to 2% of the British economy, measured by the difference between financial inflows and outflows, according to the <span class="companylink">Office for National Statistics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Household deficits mean families are net borrowers of money: Instead of accumulating savings that other sectors of the economy can use to invest, they either run down their financial assets or ramp up borrowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.K. picture contrasts with sounder family finances in most other advanced countries, including the U.S., where household financial inflows exceeded outflows by roughly 2.8% of gross domestic product in the third quarter, according to the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Families in the U.K. have a stronger tendency than their Western neighbors to feel overly optimistic about their personal finances when house prices go up, leaving them vulnerable if the economy stops, said Kallum Pickering, a London-based economist at Berenberg Bank. "British households are now very, very susceptible to a real-estate shock," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last time U.S. and U.K. households were in this situation was between 2004 and 2007, as a massive housing bubble developed. Both countries saw a sharp correction, but their paths have diverged over the past five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. is in a healthier position now because wages, though they haven't been rising as fast as usual, have still held up better than Britain's. Also, fast increases in U.K. house prices have persuaded many Britons to spend on real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite a slowdown in the second half of 2015, growth in the U.K. and the U.S. has by far outstripped that of their European peers and is expected by the <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span> to be above 2% in both countries in 2016. But some economists believe wobbly household finances and ever-rising house prices mean the U.K.'s brisk expansion is unlikely to be sustained. In Canada, the economy has already slowed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most other <span class="companylink">Group of Seven</span> countries have seen their household balances remain in the black, according to the <span class="companylink">Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In France, strong wages have enabled families to keep saving even after the storm passed. Germany has bet on export-led growth, which has driven the country to accumulate more financial assets in the rest of the world -- allowing both households and companies to save.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.K., the imbalance is expected to remain. The <span class="companylink">British government</span>'s independent fiscal watchdog, the <span class="companylink">Office for Budget Responsibility</span>, forecasts it will continue until at least 2021, adding that "this persistent and relatively large household deficit would be unprecedented."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank of England governor Mark Carney last year called real estate "the greatest risk to the domestic economy" in a speech that served to announce the enactment of tighter standards on mortgage borrowers. Although the new rules cooled the property market, an endemic shortage of housing supply has led prices to start climbing once again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, BOE officials say they are watching credit closely for signs of overheating, but aren't too worried yet, as the cost of servicing debt remains low. At the same time, more borrowers have taken up fixed-rate mortgages, meaning costs for households won't suddenly increase when the U.K. central bank decides to nudge up interest rates from 0.5%, a record low.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anne Kadet   </div><div>1017 words</div><div>29 January 2016</div><div>16:24</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city's hottest neighborhood for 2016? Forget Tribeca—it's strictly for dinosaurs. Bushwick? So last year. No, the new red-hot hood is Jamaica, Queens, the middle-class, largely immigrant community just north of JFK Airport.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least, that's according to StreetEasy, the popular New York City real-estate listing service. It crunched the numbers to predict which community will see the biggest surge in demand. Jamaica, it seems, has momentum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its population has been growing nearly three times as fast as the citywide rate in recent years, and Jamaica's median home prices rose 39% in 2015, compared with the city's 6%, according to StreetEasy's extrapolation of Census and city data. StreetEasy's own website shows the growth in views per listing in Jamaica is far outpacing the city average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">StreetEasy data scientist Alan Lightfeldt says Jamaica is gaining notice for its low prices and fast access to Manhattan—it's 21 minutes to Penn Station on the LIRR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Jamaica is primed for growth," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a little like hearing the most eligible bachelor in town is the guy behind the rental-car counter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first glance, there's not much to see in Jamaica—it's packed with hulking bureaucratic buildings and chain stores. There's a Kennedy Fried Chicken across the street from a Crown Fried Chicken.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a slow stroll reveals the area's mixed population has created some unusual culinary hybrids: Dining options included a Jamaican cafe serving sushi, a halal-Thai restaurant and a Pakistani-Chinese joint.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residents say they seldom leave the area to shop; the mom-and-pops specialize in everything from lingerie and refrigerators to fabric and human hair by the pound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Independent shops also feature intriguing names like Think Before You Ink (tattoos), Virus by Diablo (clothing) and Don't Panic (ladies' accessories).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latter is so named, says assistant manager Shyrell Mentore, “Because we have a lot of shiny shoes here, and when you come in, you start panicking."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Mentore says she loves Jamaica because it's entertaining. One example: “A man who passes here every single day who smells your shoes. I'm so serious."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He must have a foot fetish," I offered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He sure do!"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like all the locals I interviewed, Ms. Mentore hadn't heard of StreetEasy, or the news that her neighborhood is hot. But she wasn't surprised. Folks attracted to the area's street life and down-to-earth character visit from around the world. “All the way from Jersey, England, Florida," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most characteristic strip is 165th Street—a pedestrian-only street crowded with sales barkers and boutiques. It features the wonderful Jamaica Colosseum Mall offering a combination mobile/hookah shop, a dentist and what may be the galaxy's largest display of 14-karat gold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This was once the hottest mall in the neighborhood," says Julian Embrack, who opened his custom embroidery shop here in 1984. It still attracts the rap stars, he says, and he loves the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It really is local. Everyone knows everybody here, looks out for everybody here," he says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Queens real-estate broker Juan Loubriel attributes the new interest in Jamaica to its convenience and housing bargains: $330,000—the area's median sales price—buys a small row house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median asking rent—$1,750—can fetch a nice three-bedroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, says Mr. Loubriel, sums up Jamaica's appeal: “Right now, you don't have a lot of other selling points."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">True, the neighborhood has zero artisanal cheese shops. But depending on one's tolerance for affectation, this may be a plus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Folks on a budget, meanwhile, will appreciate that cheap rent isn't Jamaica's only bargain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can buy three pairs of leggings for $10, or a toilet for $60. At a Sutphin Boulevard fish market, hustling clerks dole out salmon steaks for $5 a pound, herring for $2 a pound, and for 99-cents a pound an assortment of unidentifiable parts labeled, simply, “Special."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For entertainment, residents suggest Chinese food, pickup basketball and Tropical Fantasy, a bar packed with “boogie" patrons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I saw none of the usual indicators of so-called hotness—no <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span>, Soul Cycle or <span class="companylink">Shake Shack</span>. But I did see rows of neat homes adorned in the community's preferred scheme of beige siding and brown trim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I visited VP, a renowned Caribbean record shop where the current best-selling album, according to clerk Dorothy Henry, is “Reggae Cover Jammz Volume 1."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I enjoyed lunch at an $8 all-you-can-eat Chinese buffet featuring french fries, Jell-O and something labeled “chicken dough."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jamaica is not hot, but it is cool, in the sense that folks here go about their business without much concern for what the rest of the city might think of their community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that may soon change. Plumber Keith Alves, for one, says he'd love to see the area become the hot new hood: “More tourism!" he says. “More business!"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, of course, there is new construction everywhere, with a bevy of luxury residential and retail complexes in the works.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Can the cheese be far behind?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON--The high-end London housing market might be faltering, but prices are still rising across the rest of the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average price for a London home hit a record £514,097 ($737,883) in December, up 12.4% from a year earlier, according to the Land Registry. The average price was 2.1% higher than in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House prices in London are among the most expensive in the world. Price increases have been fueled by an acute shortage and robust demand. As buying property has become increasingly less affordable, some analysts have warned parts of the market appear overheated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all parts of the market are booming. For the most expensive London dwellings, transaction volumes have fallen sharply. In October, there were 166 London homes valued over £2 million sold, down 21% from the year before, Land Registry data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A change in the U.K. transaction tax called stamp duty in December 2014 made buying homes valued over £937,000 more expensive, causing some buyers to hold off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">London was the biggest driver of house-price growth across in England and Wales, where prices were up 6.4% from a year earlier to £188,270, Land Registry data show.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Josh Barbanel   </div><div>725 words</div><div>29 January 2016</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A13</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2016, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The twilight hours of New York City's most lucrative property-tax abatement program lured hundreds of architects and developers to obtain building permits and begin construction in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Permits for 7,781 residential housing units in 299 projects were granted last month, according to new U.S. Census figures, more than four times the number issued in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The December total was the third highest monthly total in at least seven years, following only even bigger surges in May and June, when the same partial tax exemption program, known as 421-a, also faced an expiration deadline. The program expired on Jan. 15.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Real Estate Board of New York said the rush showed the importance of the 421-a program in encouraging the development of rental housing, though opponents said developers were rushing to take advantage of overly generous benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alexander Blakely, an architect and partner at AB Architekten, said he worked through December on three projects with two developers, who needed to get permits and begin construction on foundation footings to qualify for the tax break.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We had reasonable good luck and a good expediter, Mr., Blakely said. "There was a big push. We had to get the foundations in the ground before the end of the year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One project, a seven-story concrete-and-glass building at 195 Clarkson Ave. in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Prospect Lefferts Gardens, was submitted to the Department of Buildings in July, but was held up because of delays in a demolition permit. A building permit was issued on Dec. 11.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surge caps a year-long building boom, attributed to the strong housing recovery but also the rush by developers to get all possible projects under way that could qualify for benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, the Census Bureau figures show 56,248 permits issued in New York City in 2015, the most since 1962. The total far surpassed the most recent peak of 33,911 permits issued in 2008, though dozens of those projects were delayed for years after the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 421-a program is providing $1.26 billion in exemptions for developers in the current city fiscal year. It was designed to encourage the creation of housing, especially affordable housing, and has been repeatedly modified to pare back generous benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The program was extended and modified last June, to require that developers building rental housing set aside up to 30% of the units for affordable beginning in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The legislation signed by Gov. Andrew Cuomo came with a catch, though: The tax break would end if the industry couldn't reach an agreement with unionized construction workers on a wage plan for projects built under the program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the sides failed to agree by the Jan. 15 deadline, the program ended, with little signs so far of a rush by the Legislature to come up with a replacement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The most recent permit numbers clearly show the importance of the 421-a program in the development of rental housing in the city," said Jamie McShane, a spokesman for the real estate board. "Without the program, building rental and affordable housing will be increasingly infeasible putting the city's affordable housing plan in jeopardy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barika Williams, deputy director of the Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development, said developer over the years had repeatedly rushed to be part of the old 421-a rules before they expired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The industry says that whatever the new rules are, they will doom production," she said</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually the industry adapted to a new reality and then moved on, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few Manhattan projects were part of the year-end push for permits. Of the 7,781 permits, 59% were issued in Brooklyn, and 26% were issued in Queens. Manhattan, which already had stricter 421-a rules than other parts of the city, accounted for 310 permits, or 4%, according to the Census Bureau, compared with 22% for the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The December permit list has many small projects but also some large ones, including a 27-story tower with 168 apartments in Long Island City in Queens. It received a partial building permit on Dec. 30, according to city records.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Napa Valley Estate of Robin Williams Sells</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After years on and off the market, and several price cuts, the Napa Valley estate of the late comedian Robin Williams has sold for $18.1 million, according to co-listing agent Joyce Rey of Coldwell Banker Previews International.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Williams built the house, located in the Mayacamas Mountains, in the early 2000s. The estate originally went on the market in 2012 for $35 million with <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>, then was relisted in April of 2014 at $29.9 million with Ms. Rey and Cyd Greer of Coldwell Banker Previews. Mr. Williams committed suicide in August of 2014 at age 63. After his death the price was cut several more times, and the house was last listed at $22.9 million. Mr. Williams's estate didn't respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyers of the roughly 650-acre estate are the Tesseron family of Chateau Pontet-Canet. French winemakers, the family had been looking for a Napa Valley wine property for several years, and this is their first vineyard acquisition in the U.S., said co-owner Melanie Tesseron. She said they plan to make wine from the property's 18.4 acres of vineyards, but it isn't yet clear if they'll build a winery there. Wine from the property's vineyards is currently made off-site by local growers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For the moment we're here to see, look, learn and understand what we could do," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The celebrity provenance of the home had nothing to do with the purchase, she said, although "personally, I'm a massive fan of Robin Williams."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Rey said the price is one of the highest ever paid for a Napa Valley home without a winery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyers were represented by William Densberger and Rob Landsness of Pacific Union.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One57 Pitches</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Designed Pad</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the high-end Manhattan real-estate market slowing, <span class="companylink">Extell Development</span> decided to pay a designer to furnish a $20.1 million unit at its new construction condominium One57, down to the coffee table books and towels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Designer Jennifer Post spent about eight months decorating the three-bedroom, 3,228-square-foot apartment, according to Extell's Graham R. Spearman, who is handling sales in the building. Ms. Post's work was "at least a $1 million renovation," said Extell founder Gary Barnett.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The high-end real-estate market in New York City has softened in recent months, Mr. Barnett said. He said he plans to try out the same technique with other units in the building in the next few months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Midtown Manhattan Duplex</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Penthouse Asks $65 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The penthouse at midtown Manhattan condo project 100 East 53rd Street will list for $65 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The duplex penthouse, on the 60th and 61st floors of the building, will measure about 6,760 square feet, said Leonard Steinberg of Compass, one of the real-estate agents listing the penthouse. With views stretching to Central Park and the East River, the unit will have four bedrooms, four bathrooms and a powder room, he said. It will also have a 44-foot long great room and a gallery with ceilings about 23 feet high intended to display large artwork.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales at the 94-unit building launched last week, said Aby Rosen, the high-profile New York developer whose RFR Holding is joining on the project with real-estate firm Hines and <span class="companylink">China Vanke</span>, the world's largest home builder by sales. The building is slated for completion in the spring of 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Designed by the British firm Foster + Partners, the building will have a 711-foot-high angled wall "to give the facade a little depth," Mr. Rosen said. It will be light in color, in contrast with the dark facade of the nearby Seagram Building, which is owned by Mr. Rosen's RFR. Also in homage to the Seagram building, 100 East 53rd Street has a modernist look. Building amenities include a library, a gym and spa treatment rooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Classic Marketing is also listing the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenneth Griffin Lists Two</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Miami Condos for $73 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Billionaire hedge-fund manager Kenneth Griffin is putting his two newly purchased properties at Faena House in Miami Beach back on the market for a total of $73 million, according to Eloy Carmenate of <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</span>, who is listing the property with colleague Mick Duchon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The penthouse, which encompasses the top floor of the building, will be listed for $55 million. It has five bedrooms and measures about 8,270 square feet. In addition to a roof deck with its own pool, the penthouse has a wraparound terrace measuring about 7,300 square feet. The second unit, which is directly under the penthouse and encompasses half of the 15th floor, will be listed for $18 million. It has three bedrooms and measures about 4,240 square feet. The unit also has a terrace measuring about 2,720 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin bought the properties in the fall of 2015 for $60 million. His spokesperson declined to comment on whether he planned to combine them or why he is selling.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ORGANIZED LABOR</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Union Membership</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Held Steady Last Year</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rate of union membership in the U.S. held steady last year, with slight overall gains in membership rosters outweighed by the rising ranks of nonunion workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The share of U.S. workers in unions last year was unchanged at 11.1%, according to Labor Department figures released Thursday, a reflection of the labor movement's struggle to reverse years of stagnation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While unions collectively added new members, including in sectors such as leisure, hospitality, education and health services, it wasn't enough to increase the overall rate of membership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Membership in the private sector rose to 6.7% from 6.6% in 2014. The public sector also had more unionized workers in 2015 than it did the year before, but the union-membership rate fell to 35.2% from 35.7% in 2014 because of a larger increase in nonunion government workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Union officials blame battles in states such as Wisconsin that have stripped many public-sector workers of collective-bargaining rights and say labor laws need updating to make it easier for workers to unionize without intimidation from employers. Membership in Wisconsin tumbled to 8.3% last year from 11.7% in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You've got a labor movement that's not moving," said Gary Chaison, a professor of industrial relations at Clark University in Worcester, Mass. "It's a failure to be revitalized."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of existing homes that went under contract in the U.S. was little changed in December, although the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> warned of subdued demand in coming months amid global financial volatility and tight inventory.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An index measuring pending home sales -- a gauge of purchases before they become final -- rose 0.1% to a seasonally adjusted reading of 106.8 in December, the <span class="companylink">NAR</span> said. An index of 100 is equal to the average level of contract activity during 2001, which the <span class="companylink">NAR</span> considers a "normal," or balanced, market for the current U.S. population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the figure was a sign the housing market was steady in December, it missed the forecast from economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal for a 0.6% increase in sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending sales offer a forecast of the housing market because they measure purchases at the time a contract is signed rather than at closing. Contracts typically take weeks to become final, and some are ultimately canceled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending sales have been in line with steady progress in the housing market in recent months and rose 4.2% in December from the same period a year earlier.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Overall, while sustained job creation is spurring more activity compared to a year ago, the ability to find available homes in affordable price ranges is difficult for buyers in many job-creating areas," Lawrence Yun, the NAR's chief economist, said in a statement.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More Help Planned</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Flint Water Crisis</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder pledged more state assistance to address the lead-contamination crisis in Flint and is seeking federal loans and an expansion of Medicaid coverage for residents under the age of 21.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Now is the time to do things to help the people of Flint address the damage that's been done," Mr. Snyder said. "This is the start of a longer-term process to make sure that we are committed to Flint."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The governor, speaking at a news conference Wednesday at Flint's City Hall flanked by Mayor Karen Weaver and state officials, said more state officials would work out of a new office in Flint to remain in close contact with events on the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to seeking to expand Medicaid coverage for residents, the governor said the state will ask the federal <span class="companylink">Small Business Administration</span> to make low-interest loans available to local business owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The governor also said the state Senate will take up his request for $28 million in funding to address the city's water crisis. A bill was passed by the state House last week with unanimous support. But he said this money, which includes $8 million for bottled water, was only a start. "The $28 million is not the only request we're going to have," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flint's water system became contaminated with lead after the city, under an emergency manager appointed by the governor, decided to begin using water from the Flint River in April 2014 as part of a cost-saving plan. The corrosive water, however, began eating away at pipes and leaching lead and other contaminants into the water in people's homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flint residents were first told by county officials on Oct. 1 not to drink their water. Mr. Snyder declared an emergency earlier this month and activated the National Guard to help distribute filters and bottled water at sites around the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Barack Obama also declared an emergency to free up federal funds to address the water crisis.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of newly built U.S. homes rose last month, capping the best year for new-home sales since 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of new single-family homes increased 10.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 544,000 in December, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales in 2015 reached an estimated 501,000, not seasonally adjusted. That marks their highest annual level since 776,000 new homes sold in 2007, underscoring the long slog back from the housing bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Nationwide</span>, the pace of new-home sales growth in December was up 9.9% from a year earlier, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of new homes are only about a tenth of all home sales, and the data are choppy. However, the construction sector added jobs in December as rising consumer confidence, low mortgage rates and low inventory helped spur new-home sales over recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were 5.2 months' supply of newly built homes in December, down from 5.7 months in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price of new homes was $288,900, down from $305,000 in November, which some economists attributed to supply matching demand for more reasonably priced units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data on new-home sales are volatile and subject to frequent revisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Wednesday's report, the margin of error on December's 10.8% monthly sales gain was plus or minus 17.1 percentage points. There was a margin of error of 25 percentage points for the annual gain of 9.9%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price growth accelerated in November, according to a report released Tuesday, underscoring that the market continues to favor sellers and present affordability challenges for buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index, covering the entire nation, rose 5.3% in the 12 months ended in November, up from a 5.1% increase in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strong price increases are being driven in part by employment and wage growth and low mortgage rates. But economists also warn that a shortage of new homes for sale is helping to drive down the volume of sales while pushing up home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Even in the first few weeks of January, people are ready to buy and they just can't find anything," said Nela Richardson, chief economist at real-estate brokerage Redfin. Ms. Richardson said she expects that lack of desirable homes to continue to drive up prices in the coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Portland, Ore., one of the hottest markets in the country, saw the number of homes on the market drop 26% since this time last year, according to Redfin. Overall, the 15 biggest markets in the country saw inventory declines of 10%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After years of volatility, home-price growth appears to have stabilized at an annual rate of close to 5%. But West Coast markets with strong job growth are seeing much more rapid price gains than other cities. Portland had an 11.1% price gain, followed by San Francisco with 11% and Denver with 10.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast, prices in Chicago, Cleveland and Washington, D.C., rose by about 2% in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers don't give a strong indication how the recent turmoil in the stock market and global economy is affecting housing. But economists say those factors are still likely to be outweighed by a strong U.S. labor market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We're still having steady growth. It's not gangbusters by any means. We're definitely still seeing a recovery in the housing market," said Chris Bennett, a senior index analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home-price growth accelerated in November, according to a report released Tuesday, underscoring that the market continues to favor sellers and present affordability challenges for buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index, covering the entire nation, rose 5.3% in the 12 months ended in November, greater than a 5.1% increase in October. The 10-city index gained 5.3% from a year earlier, compared with a 5% increase in October. The 20-city index rose 5.8% year over year from 5.5% a month earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home prices extended their gains, supported by continued low mortgage rates, tight supplies and an improving labor market," said David Blitzer, managing director at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After years of volatility, home-price growth appears to have stabilized at an annual rate of close to 5%. But while price growth has remained fairly steady, the pace of sales has fluctuated, in part because high prices have started to scare some buyers out of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hottest U.S. markets, primarily on the West Coast, continued to show double-digit price gains. Portland, Ore., had an 11.1% price gain, followed by San Francisco with 11% and Denver with 10.9%. Dallas, Denver and Portland have reached new record highs.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank loans to China's property sector picked up at the end of 2015, as the nation's housing market showed fresh signs of recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outstanding credit extended to the whole property sector rose 21% from a year earlier to 21.01 trillion yuan ($3.19 trillion) at the end of 2015, the <span class="companylink">People's Bank of China</span> said Friday. The growth was 2.1 percentage points higher than the pace recorded a year earlier, according to the official data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's housing prices and sales have showed some improvement in recent months. The average price of new homes in 70 Chinese cities rose for the eighth month in a row in December from the month before, buoyed by strong sales in bigger cities as mortgages became cheaper.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The size of new homes rose last year, suggesting Americans' love of space remains strong but making new homes less affordable for a bigger swath of buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average size climbed to about 2,720 square feet in 2015 from about 2,660 square feet the previous year, according to data released by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> at its annual trade show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost half of the homes started last year had four or more bedrooms, and one out of four had garages with room for three or more cars.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sizes have grown lately because new construction has been tilted toward the high end. Builders do aim to draw young buyers in at lower price points, so that there is a market for some of their more expensive products over the long term. But they haven't made more starter homes in recent years mainly because of land prices, construction costs and lack of available mortgages for less-affluent buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those potential buyers, who may also be younger, help bring down the average size of new homes because they tend to live in smaller spaces than their older counterparts. They have been slow to purchase homes because they are struggling to save for down payments or be approved for mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average price of new homes for sale in 2015 climbed to $351,000, up $100,000 from 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average new-home size bottomed during the 2008 financial crisis at about 2,360 square feet and climbed sharply before leveling out in 2014 and then jumping again in 2015. Rose Quint, assistant vice president of survey research at the home builders association, said she expected square footage might begin to decline as more first-time buyers came back into the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Last year I was expecting, and I wasn't alone, that the average size of homes would actually fall … because there were new measures that were supposed to bring in a wave of first-time home buyers," Ms. Quint said. “That didn't happen."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Measures to help entice younger buyers into the market included lowering fees on loans from the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span>, which tend to be more appealing to first-time buyers because they have lower down-payment requirements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The share of first-time buyers of U.S. homes fell to 32% of all purchasers in 2015 from 33% the previous year, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>, its lowest level in three decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A major topic of conversation at this year's International Builders' Show was how to entice younger buyers to begin purchasing homes again. Ideas ranged from more communal amenities, such as pools and clubhouses, to mimicking high-end rentals to smaller homes with more outdoor space that tend to be cheaper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's a little bit concerning," said Jeff Roos, a regional president for Lennar Corp. He said the company is looking at integrating technology and designs that appeal to younger buyers. “As the millennials get older they'll see the value of buying versus renting."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market entered 2016 on a strong note after a year of solid sales, rising prices and dwindling inventories, factors supporting the economy but also likely to cap future gains for the sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales rose 14.7% in December from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.46 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Friday. For all of 2015, sales reached 5.26 million, the highest annual level since 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But home construction hasn't been keeping up with demand, leading to tight supplies and rising prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories of existing homes for sale fell 12% to 1.79 million in December. At 3.9 months of supply, inventories are at the lowest level in nearly a decade, the Realtor group said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national median home price, meanwhile, rose to $224,100, up 7.6% from a year earlier. That marks the 46th consecutive month of year-over-year price gains.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a nod to rising housing costs across the U.S., a Las Vegas developer presented its vision for of the New American Home, a staple of the annual builders show, that included nontraditional living arrangements to help ease families' financial burdens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 5,200-square foot home, perched on a hill overlooking the Vegas skyline, includes a second-floor unit that can house aging parents or recent college grads with shaky employment prospects.

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices have increased by 25% since the beginning of the recovery in 2011, according to S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index, while median household incomes have barely budged. In October, prices jumped 11% in Portland, San Francisco and Denver from the year-earlier month. In Las Vegas, prices rose 6% during that time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartment rents, meanwhile, have jumped by 20% since 2010, according to data tracker <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>., making it more difficult for prospective home buyers to save for down payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another home at the trade show, built by <span class="companylink">Pardee Homes</span>, a member of the California-based <span class="companylink">TRI Pointe Group</span>, was designed to cater to the tastes of younger home buyers in the mid-$300,000 range. It includes two guest suites that can be rented on home-sharing sites such as <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span>. Both include separate entrances and a small kitchenette and can accommodate a single person or couple in need of a roommate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a survey of young adults, <span class="companylink">TRI Pointe</span> found that 35% want to be able to rent out space in their homes at least part-time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“A lot of their motivation for doing that is to make the financial step of buying their home more doable," said Linda Mamet, vice president of corporate marketing at <span class="companylink">TRI Pointe</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the year ended June 2015, 13% of buyers purchased a home to accommodate multiple generations, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>, about the same as in 2013, when the group started collecting data. But more buyers are considering the idea: A quarter of all home buyers say they want a separate suite in their home with a kitchenette to accommodate such arrangements, according to <span class="companylink">John Burns Real Estate Consulting Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brad Hunter, chief economist at Metrostudy, a construction-research firm, said builders are stepping up efforts to build such homes to “capture the zeitgeist of affordability."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Moser, a 62-year-old money manager, and his wife, Kristin, purchased a home just outside of Tucson, Ariz., to share with his father, now 85 years old. Other family members live in homes on both sides of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Moser wanted to be near his family and alleviate his father's loneliness, but he said it was also a great deal financially. He and his father sold their previous homes for a combined $540,000 and the home they share costs $335,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Moser acknowledges the arrangement isn't for everyone. “If it doesn't work seeing your father or mother a few times a week it's not going to work every single day," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The homes were built by <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>., which has allowed buyers to select from a variety of layouts catering to multiple households living together since 2011. The company said it has sold 3,500 such homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlanta-based <span class="companylink">PulteGroup Inc</span>. launched a similar product several years ago and has seen some uptick in demand. Last year, 8% of the homes it built catered to multiple households, compared with 6% the year before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Toll Brothers Inc</span>. said it has been more aggressive in marketing multigenerational suites, and in the past few years has begun including options for a separate entrance and small kitchen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affordability is likely to continue to be a concern. Existing-home sales rose[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-rebound-in-december-1453475029] 14.7% in December from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.46 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Friday—the U.S. housing market's best year since before the recession. Inventory of existing homes for sale fell 12% to 1.79 million. At 3.9 months' worth of supply, inventories are at the lowest level in nearly a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Josh Anderson, owner of Element Design Build, said the Las Vegas home's second-floor suite includes a room for a king-size bed, a large terrace, a fireplace, a free-standing tub and a built-in cappuccino maker and warming plate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the cost of the model home is high—Mr. Anderson plans to list it for close to $4 million—the New American Home concept aims to give builders ideas that can work at lower price points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I do see more and more across all the segments this multigenerational living happening," said Mr. Anderson. “The takeaway from that is you can design some cool spaces."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two days earlier, amid concern about the plummeting price of crude and weakening economic output, <span class="companylink">Treasury</span> yields ended below 2% for the first time since mid-October. Before Thursday, <span class="companylink">Treasury</span> yields had fallen more than 13% since the start of the year amid sharp selloffs in global stock and oil markets and weak economic signals from China, and bond prices rose to a premium over face value as investors scrambled for cover. Bond yields fall as prices rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stock markets in Europe and Japan jumped Friday and U.S. equities opened higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 1.1% in afternoon trading. Crude prices rallied, with the global Brent benchmark gaining 10% to $32.18 a barrel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's basically a risk-on kind of move, which is taking the shine off Treasurys," said John Briggs, head of strategy for RBS Securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors are looking ahead to next week's meeting of the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s open market committee for clues about U.S. central bank's intentions to continue raising interest rates this year. The Fed was previously expected to implement a series of incremental hikes over the course of 2016, but strategists and economists wonder whether it will pull back from that path amid the volatility of recent weeks. Any change in the Fed's path could take the air out of the jump in bond values, with the 10-year gaining 2.6% since the start of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It does make the bond market look quite vulnerable at these elevated levels," said David Keeble, global head of interest rate strategy at <span class="companylink">Crédit Agricole</span> in New York. “There has been a lot of volatility."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The futures market is currently assigning a negligible probability to a rate increase at the January meeting, and the most likelihood to an increase in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking at the <span class="companylink">World Economic Forum</span> in Davos, Switzerland, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said central banks around the world may pursue divergent policies[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/ecb-leaves-rates-unchanged-1453380508] in the coming months according to the needs of each country's economy. The comments were interpreted as a sign that the eurozone could be willing to pursue more monetary stimulus measures even as the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> embarks on an expected series of interest rate increased in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda signaled the central bank there also has room to provide more stimulus[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/bojs-kuroda-says-no-plans-to-ease-policy-for-now-1452837044] if needed. Kuroda's comments helped fuel a 5.9% rally in Japanese stocks on Friday; the Nikkei stock index entered bear market territory earlier in the week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markets were also boosted by economic data in the U.S. showing the housing market finished 2015 on a strong note, with December existing home sales jumping 14.7% in December from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted rate of 5.46 million, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>, exceeding the consensus expectation of economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON -- In August 2014, when the housing market here was on a tear, a two-bedroom condominium in one of the most expensive neighborhoods went up for sale at GBP 3.25 million ($4.64 million), a 67% premium to its purchase price six months earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The redbrick home on Cadogan Gardens in Knightsbridge is still unsold, and expectations have been revised. The price has been cut three times,the latest at the start of this year, to GBP 2.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a great property," said Sam Spring, a sales broker at the Chelsea office of estate agency Faron Sutaria, of the 1,250-square-foot home with dark walnut floors and high-end appliances. "It's just a very price-sensitive market these days."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In London's priciest neighborhoods, the housing boom is over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wealthy investors, most prominently from Russia, China and the Mideast, swooped in on cities like London, New York and Vancouver to buy high-end homes in the years following the 2008 financial crisis. Real estate appeared to be a safe investment. Returns looked robust against ultralow interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, demand is slowing not just in London, but in prime housing markets around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average prices of luxury homes in 10 global cities analyzed by real-estate broker Knight Frank LLP are expected to rise 1.7% this year, down from 3% growth in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign investors that helped drive the boom have had to contend with weakened currencies, stock-market shocks and the collapse in oil prices. Meanwhile, a major overhaul of a U.K. transaction tax known as stamp duty increased the charge on high-price sales, and new taxes on second homes and rental properties will take effect this spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York, demand for high-end homes cooled last year, brokers said. In Miami, South American and European buyers could pull back this year due to a stronger dollar, and prices are expected to fall in Hong Kong, Singapore and Paris, Knight Frank said. Swiss lender <span class="companylink">UBS Group AG</span> said in October that housing markets in Sydney, Vancouver, San Francisco and Amsterdam appear "significantly overvalued."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luxury housing in London became one of the world's hottest assets. But "the frenzy is gone completely," said Manish Chande, senior partner at U.K. real-estate firm Clearbell Capital LLC. About 18 months ago "everything was going like hot cakes. Today it's the total opposite," Mr. Chande said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in prime central London, which includes high-end properties in posh districts like Mayfair and Chelsea, fell 1.4% during 2015, according to data-provider Lonres. Some neighborhoods fared worse. In Knightsbridge, prices dropped 5.6% in November compared with the year earlier, according to broker Knight Frank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those slides may understate what is going on: Data on high-end homes are hard to compare, because there are few of them and sellers may have the wherewithal to simply hold off rather than accept a lowered price. Transaction volumes at the top end of the London market were as much as 40% lower in December from a year earlier, according to U.K. buying agent Property Vision, and inventories of prime properties are mounting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The standoff between buyers and sellers resulted in 2,712 homes over GBP 1 million for sale in prime central London at the end of November, 81% more than in January 2014, according to buying adviser Huntly Hooper Ltd.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, in a sign of the liquidity crunch, the gap between asking prices and sales prices is widening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The difference between initial asking prices and average sales prices in prime central London was at a record 19% in the three months to November, Huntly Hooper data show. The disparity was 9% in the same period last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cadogan Gardens -- four streets ringing a shared garden -- sits on the Cadogan Estate, a 93-acre central London plot that has been in the same family for nearly 300 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The estate is on the border of Chelsea and Knightsbridge, parts of London now synonymous with fancy cars, luxury shopping and high-price penthouses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its origins are noble. The English aristocracy once had summer palaces around the fields and marshes of Chelsea. In the 1770s, the first large-scale housing development started when Charles Sloan, the Earl Cadogan, granted a lease to architect Henry Holland to build terraced homes for moderately affluent people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 1800s, the area started to be swallowed by expanding London. Sloane Square tube station opened in 1868. Much of the Cadogan Estate was redeveloped in the late 1800s after falling into decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, just a quarter of the 34 homes put up for sale on Cadogan Gardens sold, and almost half were taken off the market, according to Nathaniel Wilde, head of the Sloane Square office for estate agent Hamptons International. On Eaton Place in neighboring Belgravia, home to billionaires and diplomats, only a quarter of the around 50 homes offered were sold, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a "tough year on that patch," Mr. Wilde said. "Lots of homes are still sitting there."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Cadogan Gardens condo for sale at GBP 2.5 million was last sold in February 2014 for GBP 1.95 million, according to Land Registry records. The property developer selling the condo has been renting it out, Mr. Spring said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Superrich buyers from countries in the Mideast and Asia helped drive prices higher. But financial circumstances in those countries have changed drastically in the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil prices, slipping under $30 a barrel, are about half the price they were in May. Demand from some investors in oil-producing countries around the Middle East and Africa has waned, property agents said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mideast investors made up 4% of prime central London buyers last year, compared with 15% in 2014, according to data from broker Savills PLC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weaker currencies have kept investors in Asia and other emerging markets at bay. The portion of buyers from the Pacific-Asia region fell to 2% in 2015 from 4%, <span class="companylink">Savills</span> data show. In China, stock market routs amid concerns about economic growth have had an impact on buyers. Most investors from China have focused on new-build properties away from London's historic center, agents said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York's high-end property market, the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> noted "softer demand and a supply glut" in its December regional survey of economic conditions known as the beige book.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There has been a dramatic slowdown at the superluxury end of the market," said Andrew Gerringer, managing director of the Marketing Directors, new-development consultants. "When you see what's happened in the financial markets it just puts a bit more of a chill."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 90-story One57, just a couple of blocks from Central Park, a four-bedroom condo purchased by a European investor for $20.3 million in April recently sold for $17.75 million, according to the broker, James Cox of real-estate firm Compass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While overall the New York real-estate market remains strong, Mr. Gerringer said that demand for trophy properties over $20 million has cooled substantially over the past year, and there has been some impact on the $5 million-$10 million market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 50 United Nations Plaza, which has views of the <span class="companylink">Empire State Building</span>, the developers, Zeckendorf Development LLC and <span class="companylink">Global Holdings Inc</span>., said they cut prices by 5% on some units, although they said less expensive units on the lower floors have sold for close to the asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Sydney, upscale home prices raced 15% higher in 2015, according to Knight Frank. But growth is expected to slow to 10% this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rich Simeon, director of real-estate firm Simeon Manners, is waiting to see if the recent China stock market shakeout chokes off demand from Asian buyers. "It is too early to tell what is going to happen right now," Mr. Simeon said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Jo Eccles at London buying agent Sourcing Property said foreign buyers made up half of her business over a year ago. But now the vast majority of her clients live in London, with many working at investment banks. "The demographic has changed massively," Ms. Eccles said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Access to capital has also become increasingly difficult for foreign buyers exposed to falling oil prices, said Camilla Dell, managing partner at buying agency Black Brick. She said wealthy buyers from oil-rich African countries like Nigeria have struggled with liquidity in the past six to 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.K., the change in stamp duty in December 2014 made homes valued over GBP 937,000 more expensive for buyers. Stamp duty chargesrise in steps toa maximum of 12% on the portion of sales over GBP 1.5 million. The previous regime charged a flat rate based on the value of the home, with the duty rising to 7% on homes over GBP 2 million. Last year, to compensate for the change, some sellers adjusted their prices lower, agents said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wealthy buyers can generally afford the outlay, said Alex Newall,managing director at Hanover Private Office. But the new tax has made people wanting to trade up to a bigger home hold off on transactions, "instead opting to do renovations or additions to their existing properties," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the prime central London market is stuttering, prices are still pushing higher in the rest of London amid a housing shortage. The average dwelling in November sold for GBP 506,724, up 11.2% from the year before, according to Land Registry data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding to demand are buyers that a few years ago would have focused exclusively on prime central neighborhoods. For instance, some wealthy Middle Eastern buyers have started to see better value in new-build projects away from the center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These clients are now willing to look 10 miles out," said Jo Leverett, head of international residential markets at estate agent Cluttons LLP. "That's new."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, London has become drastically less affordable. When <span class="companylink">UBS</span> warned in October that the city was at risk of a housing bubble, it noted that real earnings have fallen 7% since 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're due a price correction," said Robert Nichols, managing director at London estate agent Portico. "When you can't think of anyone who can afford to live on your street, you know there is something wrong."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, areas dependent on the superrich are the ones suffering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">St. George's Hill, a gated community in the suburbs of Surrey, became popular with wealthy Russians during the boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, around a quarter of the over 400 homes in the area are for sale or set to come onto the market, according to Hanover Private Office. Just 13 homes were sold there last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wealthy Russians have pulled back from the London market amid international sanctions, the depreciation of the ruble and political pressure to rein in foreign spending, buying agents representing Russians said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saddle Stones, a six-bedroom mansion in St. George's Hill, was listed in August 2014 at GBP 9.5 million. The asking price is now GBP 7.5 million. The home, complete with a cinema room, elevator and swimming pool, was designed with a Russian buyer in mind, said Natalia Rotenberg, founder of design firm NR Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Rotenberg said homes in the area remain for sale despite lavish parties thrown for potential buyers. "We've won awards for our interiors. But they still don't sell," Ms. Rotenberg said in a September interview.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High Court Eases</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prosecutors' Burden</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Supreme Court on Wednesday eased the burden for prosecutors seeking the death penalty, throwing out state-court rulings intended to make sure jurors properly considered evidence weighing against a defendant's execution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The issue came from Kansas, where a 2001 state Supreme Court ruling said jurors have to be told that mitigating evidence -- aspects about a defendant's crime or background pointing toward mercy -- doesn't have to be proven by the defense beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The jury instructions in question came at trials for brothers Jonathan and Reginald Carr, who were convicted of mass murder, rape and kidnapping dubbed the Wichita Massacre.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trial judge told jurors at a sentencing hearing that it was the prosecution's burden to "prove beyond a reasonable doubt" that "aggravating circumstances" justify death and "are not outweighed by any mitigating circumstances."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the 8-1 majority, said that the Kansas high court was wrong to read such a specific jury instruction into the Bill of Rights. On the basis of the trial judge's instructions, "no juror would reasonably have speculated that mitigating circumstances must be proved by any particular standard, let alone beyond a reasonable doubt," he wrote.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts, which reflect groundbreakings on single-family homes and apartments, fell 2.5% from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.15 million, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CRIME</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Murders, Rapes Rose</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In First Half of 2015</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Murders in the U.S. rose 6.2% in the first half of 2015, according to preliminary crime data released Tuesday by the <span class="companylink">Federal Bureau of Investigation</span>, figures that are likely to further fuel the current political debates about crime, policing and sentencing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Violent crime overall increased 1.7%, the <span class="companylink">FBI</span> found, while property crimes decreased 4.2%, compared with the first six months of 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising crime has been a hotly debated topic over the past year in law-enforcement circles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FBI Director James Comey has suggested the increase may be partly a result of what police officials call the "Ferguson effect" -- a greater reluctance on the part of police officers to engage with suspects for fear of being criticized for alleged abuse or discrimination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ostensible phenomenon is named after Ferguson, Mo., where public protests and looting followed the killing of an unarmed black 18-year-old in August 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The director blamed a "chill wind"" blowing through law enforcement in cities like Sacramento, Calif., and Washington, D.C. "In today's <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> world,"" Mr. Comey asked, "are officers reluctant to get out of their cars and do the work that controls violent crime?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">White House officials and civil-rights groups have dismissed speculation about such an effect as unfounded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Justice Department spokesman Patrick Rodenbush said "it is too early to draw any long-term conclusions"" from the data and noted that the overall violent-crime rate remains historically low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the preliminary figures compiled for the first six months of 2015, the number of aggravated assaults increased 2.3% and the number of rapes under a previous definition increased 9.6%. Rapes under a revised definition increased 1.1%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signals as Positive</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A gauge of home-builder sentiment held steady in January at December's revised lower reading, a sign of modest growth in a pivotal sector of the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> housing market index stayed at 60 this month, the trade group said Tuesday. Readings over 50 mean most builders generally see conditions in the single-family-housing market as positive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected a January reading of 62.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For last month, the index fell from an initial setting at 61 to a revised reading of 60. November's gauge of 62 was slightly off from a 10-year high of 65 in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The economic outlook remains promising, as consumers regain confidence and home values increase, which will help the housing market move forward," said NAHB Chief Economist David Crowe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey suggests builders are feeling relatively encouraged at the start of the year despite the prospect of more expensive mortgage costs after the recent increase in short-term interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"After eight months hovering in the low 60s, builder sentiment is reflecting that many markets continue to show a gradual improvement, which should bode well for future home sales in the year ahead," NAHB Chairman Tom Woods, a home builder from Missouri, said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOUSTON—Home sellers are slashing prices and offering incentives to keep buyers from walking away from contracts as an 18-month oil slump buffets this city's once-booming housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-construction permits in the area plunged 26% from a year earlier in the third quarter, while December sales of existing single-family houses fell nearly 10% from the same month of 2014, according to data from the Commerce Department and Houston-area brokers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders are hustling to reverse declining sales and rising cancellation rates by beefing up incentives. <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> in October advertised homes in several of its Houston developments with price cuts of up to $31,000 and commissions available to buyers' agents of $2,000 to $10,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, the area's average single-family home price was down about 7.5% to just over $280,200 in December from its June record high, according to the <span class="companylink">Houston Association of Realtors</span>. Even the high end is hurting: The average sale price for luxury homes, defined as the top 5% of the market, fell 5% to $1.3 million in the fourth quarter from the same period a year earlier, according to real-estate brokerage Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Behind the slump is the plunge in oil prices from close to $100 a barrel in August 2014 to about $29 Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“While Houston has figured out how to diversify [its industry makeup] a lot, we still are an oil-and-gas city," said Scott Merovitch, Houston division president for closely held builder Chesmar Homes LP, which saw a higher cancellation rate in Houston in 2015 and notched 20% fewer sales. “We're going to ebb and flow with oil and gas."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the country, regions where housing markets rode the energy boom look shaky. Home prices in North Dakota are 22% overvalued, while the figure in Texas is 15% and Colorado's prices are 10% too high, based on the historical average ratio of prices to incomes, according to Arch Mortgage Insurance Co.'s Housing and Mortgage Market Review.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil prices tripled between 2009 and 2014, helping Houston outpace every other U.S. metropolitan area in home construction in the period. Prices for existing Houston homes rose 37% since 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first sign of trouble came in mid-2014, when oil prices began their decline. Houston's home sales managed to sustain their momentum until this past summer, when news of the Iran nuclear accord spurred concerns of increased Iranian oil production adding to a supply glut. At the same time, big Houston oil-and-gas employer <span class="companylink">ConocoPhillips</span> warned workers of layoffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Olu Fagbemiro and her husband were concerned enough about instability in the industry to demand a price cut on the home they were under contract to buy. Ms. Fagbemiro, a consultant and engineer for the oil industry, and her husband, an accountant in the industry, in October got Keystone Classic Homes to cut $14,000 from the price of their three-bedroom home under construction near downtown Houston, to $621,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Fagbemiro said her husband's job isn't in peril, but they believed the industry's struggles were reason enough to renegotiate. They “had information on companies laying off people, and we thought the [housing] market will continue to stay stagnant for quite a bit of time," Ms. Fagbemiro said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michele Marano, a Houston real-estate agent who specializes in oil-and-gas clients and worked with Ms. Fagbemiro, said “my buyers have completely backed off." She added, “I have an enormous number of buyers but they're sitting."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few neighborhoods illustrate Houston's slowdown as dramatically as the communities that sprouted since 2011 around the site of <span class="companylink">Exxon Mobil Corp</span>.'s 385-acre campus just north of Houston. Roughly 10,000 workers, most already living in Houston, moved to the campus as it opened in phases in 2014 and 2015. Developers readied thousands of lots for upscale houses in anticipation of a flood of oil executives moving to the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, unsold homes sit near the <span class="companylink">Exxon Mobil</span> campus, with the supply of so-called speculative houses there exceeding the metropolitan area's average since the second quarter of 2014, according to housing market researcher Metrostudy, part of <span class="companylink">Hanley Wood LLC</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The higher end of Houston's market has been hit especially hard. The number of unsold lots for homes priced at $400,000 and up has ballooned, said Lawrence Dean, a Metrostudy senior adviser in Houston, who estimated it will take three to four years to exhaust the supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Likewise, the number of homes listed at $1 million or more rose 54% in the third quarter from a year earlier, according to Redfin. The surge allows buyers to be more selective and forced some sellers to cut prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary Sova and his wife, Beth, were able to negotiate a roughly $140,000 discount on a home in the $1 million range in the Woodlands, near the <span class="companylink">Exxon</span> campus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sova, a 62-year-old executive in the waste and recycling business, said the market shifted significantly in favor of buyers from when they started looking in February with their real-estate agent, Amy McGee, to when they bought the home in early November. He said many buyers were selling because they had lost jobs or were relocating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agents started to say “just make me an offer." That never happened at the beginning of their house hunt, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think this oil thing has spooked people a little bit," he said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Harriet Torry   </div><div>527 words</div><div>19 January 2016</div><div>11:03</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—A gauge of home-builder sentiment held steady in January at December's revised lower reading, a sign of modest growth in a key sector of the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> housing market index stayed at 60 this month, the trade group said on Tuesday. A reading over 50 means most builders generally see conditions in the single-family housing market as positive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected a reading of 62 in January. For last month, the index declined from an initial setting at 61 to a revised reading of 60. November's gauge of 62 was slightly off from a 10-year high of 65 in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“While the level is down from the recent high, it is still showing a gain over the past year," HFE economist Jim O'Sullivan said in a note to clients. NAHB Chief Economist David Crowe said the reading shows the “economic outlook remains promising, as consumers regain confidence and home values increase, which will help the housing market move forward."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After touching the 10-year high last fall, home-builder confidence has wobbled slightly in recent months. The survey suggests builders are feeling relatively positive at the start of the year, despite the prospect of more expensive mortgage costs following the recent rise in short-term interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“After eight months hovering in the low 60s, builder sentiment is reflecting that many markets continue to show a gradual improvement, which should bode well for future home sales in the year ahead," NAHB Chairman Tom Woods, a home builder from Blue Springs, Mo., said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> in mid-December raised its benchmark interest rate[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/fed-raises-rates-after-seven-years-at-zero-expects-gradual-tightening-path-1450292616]for the first time in nearly a decade, but signaled it plans to increase rates only gradually in the coming months and years, which could help blunt the impact of higher borrowing costs on the housing sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 3.92%[http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/] for the week ending Thursday, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, down slightly from 3.97% the week before and 4.01% in the final week of 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historically low interest rates and rising rents have made a home purchase more appealing for those who can afford a down payment, but housing prices have also risen in much of the country. Although job growth has been steady over the past five years, wages have stayed relatively flat, making it harder for people to save for a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> index has been positive since mid-2014 and in recent months risen to levels last seen before the housing bubble burst. In October 2005, it registered at 68, but just one year later had plummeted to 31.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More housing data is due out later this week, including the Commerce Department's report on housing starts on Wednesday and the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>' report on existing home sales on Friday.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Patrice O’Shaughnessy   </div><div>946 words</div><div>15 January 2016</div><div>21:35</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The look of Pelham, N.Y., harks back to its Colonial days with stately trees, stone walls and hilly streets, and houses built in the 1920s have timeless character.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bucolic serenity, good schools and quick commute to Manhattan form the main appeal of the oldest town in Westchester County, but an underlying sense of civic pride and the prominence of local history are also attractive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“People still dig up historic treasures in their yards like cannon balls, pewter plates and much more," said Town Historian Blake Bell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The town is virtually fully developed, which gives a sense of stability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's a very caring town," said Town Supervisor Peter DiPaola. “Residents come because they work in the city, and they can get here in 30 minutes to see their kid's Little League game."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pelham was a playground for the rich and famous in the Roaring '20s, when huge mansions dotted the area near Long Island Sound. They were torn down as casualties of the Great Depression, according to Mr. Bell. Today, the town is characterized by large, single-family Colonial and Tudor homes, many of them nearly a century old.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices range from the high $400,000s to more than $2 million. Realtor.com says the average home price, including condominiums, is $648,000 and the median closing price is $820,000. MLS.com, a real-estate website, gives the average selling price of a single-family home as $927,563.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are a few condominiums. Marbury Corners, built in 2005, was the last big project. A project on Wolfs Lane, still in the proposal stage, would have rental apartments and provide more parking for the Metro-North train station, said Mr. DiPaola.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property tax is substantial: 3.3% of the full market value of the house, so a $1 million home would have a tax bill of $33,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kevin Bray, his wife and their 6-year-old son moved from Long Island City, Queens, to a Dutch Colonial in the Village of Pelham in June. They will pay about $24,000 a year in property tax. He said that is comparable to what he would pay to send his son to a private school in New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Schools were a very important consideration for us," he said. “And we are right near his school, as well as being a 30-minute train ride to our jobs in Manhattan."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Town of Pelham is bordered by Mount Vernon, New Rochelle and the Bronx. It comprises the Village of Pelham and Pelham Manor, totaling about 2.2 square miles, with 12,400 people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fifth Avenue, which becomes Wolfs Lane, is the shopping, civic and cultural swath, where the town hall and historic Town House—an old church parish house that hosts town offices—as well as the Pelham Art Center, the Pelham Picture House and a variety of restaurants and shops are located.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The one-story storefronts keep the charm of the commercial district," said Joe Benefico, a lifelong Pelham resident who was president of the Pelham Civic Association for six years until Dec. 31.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We are the only smaller community in the area—Mount Vernon and New Rochelle are cities," he said. “People are flocking here because of the charm, and the small-town feel."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pelham was settled in 1654 and incorporated as a town in 1788, making it the oldest in Westchester County. It was part of a huge tract of land bought by Thomas Pell from the Siwanoy Indians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the American Revolution, the Battle of Pelham was fought along Split Rock Road and Wolfs Lane, with victory going to the British army.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For about 150 years Pelham has had a history of active community involvement, from volunteer firefighting and tree planting that began in the 1800s to the many community improvement and charitable organizations that exist today, such as the Newcomers' Club to welcome new residents, the Pelham Preservation &amp; Garden Society, and the <span class="companylink">Junior League</span> of Pelham, which donated the Woodland Park playground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The town is proud of its old trees. The most venerable, a massive oak, is at least 200 years old, according to Mr. Bell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Schools: The Village and the Manor share Pelham Union Free School District #1, which serves 2,812 students attending Pelham Memorial High School, Pelham Middle School and four elementary schools: Colonial, Hutchinson, Prospect Hill and Siwanoy. The lower schools are highly rated by greatschools.org, a website providing school data. In 2015, 93% of the high school's seniors went on to college, and the average SAT score was 1657, compared with the national average of 1590.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parks: Wolfs Lane Park is mile-long green space, and includes new Woodland Park playground, a nature-based play space. Glover Field has ball and hockey fields and tennis courts. Nearby Glen Island Park in New Rochelle and Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx have waterfront access.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dining: Chipper Truck Cafe, Soula's Kitchen, Bistro Rollin, Bangkok City, Prime 16 Tap House + Burgers, La Fontanella and J Cafe are all located on Fifth Avenue or Wolfs Lane.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shopping: A hardware store, bakery, market, pharmacy, delicatessen and clothing boutiques are located along Fifth Avenue and Wolfs Lane. There is a Fairway and a <span class="companylink">BJ's Wholesale Club</span> in Pelham Manor, big-box stores in Mount Vernon and New Rochelle, and Cross County Shopping Center in Yonkers is nearby.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Josh Barbanel   </div><div>761 words</div><div>16 January 2016</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A13</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2016, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York has become a trillion-dollar city, according to city tax assessors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New preliminary tax rolls released Friday show that with rising values for both residential and commercial properties, the total market value of taxable property rose to $1.072 trillion for the fiscal year beginning July 1, a 10.6% increase from the $969.4 billion reported this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the largest increase in market values in a decade, since the tax year ending in June 2008, when values computed by tax assessors soared 18.1%. That was shortly before the financial crisis and the crash of the city's real-estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By far the strongest growth in market value was in Brooklyn, which has become a destination of choice for many new to New York. The value of apartment buildings rose by 18.2% and the total value of real estate rose 16%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan and Queens also showed strong growth. In Manhattan, which pays nearly two-thirds of the city's property taxes, values climbed 9.3%; market values were up 9.9% in Queens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increases come after a large run-up in residential rents and apartment prices, though brokers say the pace is likely to slow next year. The figures exclude valuations for government buildings, parks, schools, and religious and charitable organizations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average tax on a condo will go up 10.7% to $9,302, according to the tax roll data, while the average tax on a co-op will go up by 6.5% to $6,837. The average tax on single-family homes will go up 3.8% to $5,138. For rental- apartment buildings, the average tax will rise 9.4% to $4,236 an apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City officials attributed 89% of the increase in market values to rising assessments of individual properties. Most of the rest was traced to booming construction, especially of apartment buildings in many neighborhoods across the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This year's tax roll is simply a reflection of New York City's growing real estate market," said Jacques Jiha, commissioner of the city's Department of Finance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He noted the construction of rental buildings rose sharply and now makes 36% of all construction activity in the city, and 55% of all construction in Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because state law requires that increased market values be gradually phased in for most taxpayers, the surge in market values will translate into a more modest windfall for the New York City treasury this year, and more modest tax bills for New Yorkers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the city, the strong property values could mean hundreds of millions in additional tax collections on top of the $23.5 billion forecast for the fiscal year beginning in July in the city's November 2015 financial plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That plan forecast a 4.8% increase from the previous fiscal year, but the new preliminary tax rolls show an increase of 8.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even after allowing for reductions in the rolls through an appeal process, the new roles indicate the tax receipts are likely to be at least $300 million higher at current tax rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase comes as the city faces pressure from a state budget proposed by Gov. Andrew Cuomo that would shift hundreds of millions of dollars in costs from the state to the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But city budget officials say they project tax revenues conservatively. "We know revenues will not continue at this pace, so we must continue to maintain strong reserves to protect the City's fiscal health," said Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for the city's Office of Management and Budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Brooklyn, despite a huge surge in market value of one-family homes, taxes on those homes rose only 4%. That is due to a state law that limits increases on assessments of one- to three-family homes to no more than 5% a year or 20% over five years. The average home was valued at $782,444, up 16.6% from $671,818 last year, but the average tax bill was $5,117, an increase of $197 from the current year, according to the preliminary assessment roll.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most valuable office building, according to the new data, is the Bank of America Tower on West 42nd Street at Sixth Avenue valued at $1.7 billion. The most valuable mixed-use building was Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle valued at $2.02 billion.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Leigh Kamping-Carder   </div><div>457 words</div><div>15 January 2016</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M12</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2016, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking for a real-estate steal? Try shopping on Mansion Drive. Despite its highfalutin name, homes there are a relative bargain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spread Sheet looked at home prices on streets with architectural names -- bungalow, cabin, castle, cottage, mansion and villa -- to see if the street name correlated with the home price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes on Mansion Street (and equivalents, such as Mansion Road, Avenue, Court and Boulevard) were the least expensive, with a median asking price of $110.70 a square foot, according to real-estate website Zillow, which examined listings as of Dec. 1. Homes on Bungalow Street had the highest prices, at $205.08 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cabin Street homes were the largest, with a median size of 1,990 square feet, while Villa Street homes measured a relatively minuscule 1,339 square feet. Cottage Street home listings were the most numerous, at 353.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, a lot more goes into the price than the street name, said Svenja Gudell, Zillow's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's going to make a big difference where these listings are actually located," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most expensive home for sale on a Mansion-named street was a two-bedroom on Mansion Court in Menlo Park, Calif., listed for $1.995 million. "Everyone feels that when you say you have a condo at Mansion Court, that it's very prestigious," says listing agent Lyn Jason Cobb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From a marketing perspective, a mansion moniker could improve the perception of a road with less-expensive homes, while luxury buyers might prefer something less ostentatious, says Miro Copic, a marketing professor at San Diego State University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If Mansion Street is really lower-end homes, it helps elevate the perception of that area, but not among the high-end consumers," he says. "They tend to want to be a little more subtle and a little more low-key."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agent Jay Overbye's beachside bungalow is one of many on Bungalow Walk on New York's Fire Island. "It's inevitable with the history of bungalows in Fire Island that one of those walks was going to be called Bungalow Walk," he said. (The home, listed for $699,000, is in contract.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Glenview Hills, Ky., a five-bedroom log cabin is the original house on Cabin Way, said David Bell of Kentucky Select Properties, who is listing the home for $675,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The structure inspired the name of the road when the surrounding area became a subdivision in the 1960s, said Mr. Bell.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anya Martin   </div><div>765 words</div><div>15 January 2016</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2016, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You want to buy the house -- but only if it comes with the boat out back. The owner may agree to the deal, but your lender probably won't include it in the mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York's <span class="companylink">Hamptons</span>, real-estate agent Diane Saatchi says she has seen buyers purchase the previous owner's pool table, fully furnished staged homes and a condo where the seller included a small boat. These transactions are most common with second homes and vacation properties, adds Ms. Saatchi, an associate broker with Saunders &amp; Associates in East Hampton, N.Y.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the house is purchased with cash, the extra items can be wrapped directly into the purchase price. But if the house is financed, the extras are broken out of the mortgage, says Christopher Minardi, branch manager of the East Hampton office of New York-based lender <span class="companylink">Guardhill Financial</span>. In most cases, lenders prefer a buyer make a separate purchase deal for the personal property with the seller, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When personal property is wrapped into the sales contract, the lender will subtract that value from the purchase price in calculating loan-to-value ratio, which reflects the amount of the loan as a percentage of the home's value, says John Walsh, president of Milford, Conn.-based Total Mortgage. In other words, if the home's purchase price is $1 million and includes $25,000 in furnishings, the sale price for the purposes of the down payment and mortgage will be $975,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rule of thumb is that personal property can be included in the loan if it is either physically attached or commonly passed along with a house, Mr. Walsh says. Lenders assume a refrigerator, draperies and light fixtures are part of the deal, for example, but a pool table, even one in a designated game room, is not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, a lender typically won't object if the personal property's inclusion is not above the home's appraised value, says Mark Shulman, chief credit officer with <span class="companylink">SunTrust Mortgage</span>. In other words, yes, the seller can just leave that old sofa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SunTrust doesn't specify a particular dollar amount to trigger a special circumstance, but if the property is valued at $1,000 or more, it likely won't be allowed, Mr. Shulman says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason lenders disallow personal items is that they can be difficult to appraise, he explains. Also if the buyer defaults on the loan, he could take away the furnishings or drive away in the car, leaving the lender with no way to recoup that part of the loan, Mr. Shulman says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agents also prefer to stay out of personal-property price negotiations because they don't get a commission on an extra transaction, which often leads to a conflict between the buyer and seller over the property value, Ms. Saatchi says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a slippery slope because people get very emotional," she adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A special circumstance may occur when a speculative builder is providing a fully furnished new home. If that's common and customary in a market, a lender may allow the furniture to be included in the loan, Mr. Walsh says. SunTrust, however, doesn't include furniture under any circumstances, Mr. Shulman says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An elaborately outfitted Arizona mansion listing for $35 million could set a new record for the state if it fetches its asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 12-acre gated estate has a hair salon, a movie theater and an indoor basketball court, according to Walt Danley and Catherine Jacobson of <span class="companylink">Walt Danley Realty</span>, who are listing the property with global marketing support by <span class="companylink">Christie's International Real Estate</span>. The property is located in Paradise Valley[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/a-slice-of-provence-in-paradise-valley-asks-9-85-million-1436453076], an affluent community between Scottsdale and Phoenix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it sells for its asking price, it would set a record for the priciest home sale ever in Arizona, according to Jim Patterson of the Information Market, a Tempe-based real estate data and analytics company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surrounded by palm trees, the estate has views of Camelback Mountain. The five-bedroom main house measures more than 30,000 square feet, with a domed ceiling and twin stairways at the entrance. The master suite has the hair salon, a sitting room, an office, a kitchenette and multiple terraces as well as his-and-hers closets. The basketball court has an electronic scoreboard and a skybox. The movie theater is decorated with James Bond posters and boasts its own lobby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The grounds include a swimming pool, his-and-hers pool houses and a three-bedroom guesthouse with its own infinity pool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seller is Robert Sussman, founder of New York City-based hedge-fund company Bentley Capital Management. Mr. Sussman, 68, said he spent about five years building the house, completing it in 2005. He said he is selling because he and his wife are planning to spend more time with family in California.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median apartment prices in Brooklyn rose 12% in 2015 and house prices hit a record per square foot, according to a market report out Thursday from Brown Harris Stevens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brooklyn prices climbed faster than those in Manhattan earlier in the year but lagged behind in the fourth quarter, said Gregory Heym, an economist at Brown Harris Stevens.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anya Martin   </div><div>756 words</div><div>13 January 2016</div><div>10:29</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You want to buy the house—but only if it comes with the boat out back. The owner may agree to the deal, but your lender probably won't include it in the mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York's tony Hamptons, real-estate agent Diane Saatchi says she has seen buyers purchase the previous owner's pool table, fully furnished staged homes and a condo where the seller included a small boat. These transactions are most common with second homes and vacation properties[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/how-to-finance-a-vacation-home-1427385991], adds Ms. Saatchi, an associate broker with Saunders &amp; Associates in East Hampton, N.Y.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the house is purchased with cash, the extra items can be wrapped directly into the purchase price. But if the house is financed, the extras are broken out of the mortgage, says Christopher Minardi, branch manager of the East Hampton office of New York-based lender <span class="companylink">Guardhill Financial</span>. In most cases, lenders prefer a buyer make a separate purchase deal for the personal property with the seller, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When personal property is wrapped into the sales contract, the lender will subtract that value from the purchase price in calculating loan-to-value ratio[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/when-a-mortgage-hinges-on-home-values-1418835033], which reflects the amount of the loan as a percentage of the home's value, says John Walsh, president of Milford, Conn.-based Total Mortgage. In other words, if the home's purchase price is $1 million and includes $25,000 in furnishings, the sale price for the purposes of the down payment and mortgage will be $975,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rule of thumb is that personal property can be included in the loan if it is either physically attached or commonly passed along with a house, Mr. Walsh says. Lenders assume a refrigerator, draperies and light fixtures are part of the deal, for example, but a pool table, even one in a designated game room, is not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, a lender typically won't object if the personal property's inclusion is not above the home's appraised value, says Mark Shulman, chief credit officer with <span class="companylink">SunTrust Mortgage</span>. In other words, yes, the seller can just leave that old sofa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SunTrust doesn't specify a particular dollar amount to trigger a special circumstance, but if the property is valued at $1,000 or more, it likely won't be allowed, Mr. Shulman says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason lenders disallow personal items is that they can be difficult to appraise, he explains. Also if the buyer defaults on the loan, he could take away the furnishings or drive away in the car, leaving the lender with no way to recoup that part of the loan, Mr. Shulman says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agents also prefer to stay out of personal-property price negotiations because they don't get a commission on an extra transaction, which often leads to a conflict between the buyer and seller over the property value, Ms. Saatchi says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's a slippery slope because people get very emotional," she adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A special circumstance may occur when a speculative builder is providing a fully furnished new home. If that's common and customary in a market, a lender may allow the furniture to be included in the loan, Mr. Walsh says. SunTrust, however, doesn't include furniture under any circumstances, Mr. Shulman says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are a few more considerations for mortgage borrowers who are also purchasing personal property:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Car trouble. With cars, boats and other vehicles, if borrowers apply for a separate loan at the same time as a mortgage, that action will raise their debt-to-income (DTI) ratio, which can affect their ability to qualify for the mortgage, Mr. Shulman says. Federal rules require most jumbo borrowers to have a 43% or lower DTI.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Tax issues. Unlike a home purchase, personal-property sales are usually subject to sales tax, Ms. Saatchi says. On the other hand, if the value were wrapped into the home purchase price, it could be subject to local real-estate transfer taxes as well, adding to the expense, she adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• A room with a view. Today lenders are more likely to approve one item of personal property as part of the real-estate deal: the flat-screen TV—but only if it is attached to the wall, Mr. Minardi says. However, borrowers should check with their lender before assuming speakers or specialty seating in a home theater will be allowed, he adds.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Art Patnaude   </div><div>410 words</div><div>13 January 2016</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Europe Edition)</div><div>WSJE</div><div>B5</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2016, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. real-estate investor <span class="companylink">LaSalle Investment Management</span> has struck two U.K. rental apartment deals in its latest step toward becoming one of Britain's biggest owners of multifamily properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chicago-based LaSalle said Tuesday it bought a total of 270 multifamily units in London and Leeds for a combined GBP 55 million ($80 million). The firm has now invested GBP 115 million in 562 U.K. apartments specifically built to rent since making its first acquisition last summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The multifamily sector in Britain is still in a nascent stage. Small landlords with a handful of homes dominate the rental market. But a decadeslong effort to institutionalize the fragmented sector is gaining traction. A decade ago, there were practically no purpose-built rental homes in the country. These typically have amenities like concierge services or gyms. Now there are more than 23,080 either completed, under construction or in the planning process, according to the <span class="companylink">British Property Federation</span>, an industry group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In the U.S. it's a fully established sector. We see no reason why that can't happen in the U.K.," said Andrew Stanford, U.K. residential fund manager at LaSalle. "It's certainly been a long time coming."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One major driver: More British people are renting. In the past few years, buying homes has been increasingly unaffordable as house prices moved higher, outstripping wage growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investor demand for less-developed parts of the real-estate market, from industrial warehouses to student housing, is also playing a role. Demand for property has pushed up prices around the world, as returns on property investment appear attractive because interest rates remain low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lasalle bought 87 apartments in the Rathbone Market redevelopment in East London for GBP 30 million from the English Cities Fund, created by the <span class="companylink">U.K. government</span> to spur private-rented sector investment. The gross-initial yield was 5.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Leeds, the firm bought Waterside Apartments from U.S. private-equity firm CarVal Investors LLC for GBP 25 million at a gross-initial yield of 6.7%. The 2008-built blocks have 183 one- and two-bedroom apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LaSalle has around $5 billion of residential assets under management globally. It plans to invest GBP 500 million in the U.K. multifamily sector "within the next few years" on behalf of its institutional clients, Mr. Stanford said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Emily Blunt and John Krasinski List Pad</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Los Angeles home of actors Emily Blunt and John Krasinski -- which was gift wrapped by neighbor and late-night host Jimmy Kimmel one Christmas -- is listing for $8 million, according to listing agent Catherine Marcus of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Blunt and Mr. Krasinski purchased the contemporary West Hollywood home in 2009 for $1.86 million, according to public records. The renovated five-bedroom measures about 4,900 square feet and has a roof deck and swimming pool, said Ms. Marcus, who referred to it as "a sexy family home."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple lived in the hillside house for several years and then decided to renovate it, adding the pool and a third story, Ms. Marcus said. But they "wound up buying another house" and no longer live there, she said. Their daughter, Hazel, was born in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesperson for the couple said they're selling because they've decided to relocate to the East Coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within walking distance of the hotel and celebrity hangout Chateau Marmont, the house has views of west Los Angeles framed by floor-to-ceiling windows. With a long driveway, the home can't be seen from the street and is "super private," Ms. Marcus said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comedian Mr. Kimmel lives across the street, and he and Mr. Krasinski developed a yearly tradition of pranking each other at Christmastime; Mr. Kimmel's gift-wrap of Mr. Krasinski's home was documented on his show, "Jimmy Kimmel Live."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Krasinski will appear in the coming movie "13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi," while Ms. Blunt is filming "The Girl on the Train."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York Home Tries Its Luck</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After many years on and off the market, a Manhattan townhouse is hiking its price 11% to $28.888 million in hopes of attracting Chinese buyers, for whom the number 8 is considered a fortunate digit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After previously asking $26 million with another firm, the Upper East Side townhouse is now listing with William Stafford IV and Ryan Serhant of Nest Seekers International. "We work with a lot of overseas buyers," said Mr. Stafford. "We're hoping to grab their attention by listing it at that number."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This isn't the home's first price increase. Owner Yoram Koby, a real-estate investor, purchased the house in the 1990s, according to public records. He listed the house in 2005 for $9.5 million, and it has been on and off the market since then with various agents, with its price always increasing, according to the real estate listings website StreetEasy. Mr. Koby renovated the house after taking it off the market a few months ago, Mr. Stafford said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Koby said the latest price tag reflects the renovation and the fact that Manhattan prices "have increased dramatically" over the past few years. Plus, while he's selling because he wants to move to Florida, "I'm in no rush," he said, adding that he's rejected other offers for the house, including one for $21 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Koby lives in one of the four apartments in the house. The others -- a triplex, a duplex and a one-bedroom -- are rented to tenants, he said, but the house could be delivered vacant. Built around 1904, the building measures about 8,200 square feet, with 12 bedrooms, Mr. Koby said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kourtney and Khloe Kardashian's</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Miami Hangout Goes Up for Sale</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Miami Beach penthouse once occupied by reality-television celebrities Kourtney and Khloe Kardashian will go on the market for $5.9 million, according to listing agent Jeff Miller of Brown Harris Stevens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The suite is on the top floor of the Hilton Bentley Miami/South Beach hotel, Mr. Miller said. The duo, who are sisters of fellow reality star Kim Kardashian, stayed in the penthouse for eight weeks in 2009 while filming "Kourtney &amp; Khloe Take Miami," according to Hilton Bentley General Manager John Lacle. They returned again in 2010, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, the penthouse was owned by the hotel and operated as a hotel room, with a nightly rate of roughly $2,000 to $5,000, Mr. Lacle said. He declined to specify the rate the Kardashians received, but said it was discounted. The sisters weren't available for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2010 the unit was purchased by literary agent Esmond Harmsworth, who paid $3.6 million for it, according to public records. Mr. Harmsworth then renovated the unit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10th-floor penthouse has two bedrooms and measures about 1,880 square feet, Mr. Miller said. The unit is being sold fully furnished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mediterranean Miami Beach Home With Private Dock Lists for $27.5 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A waterfront home in Miami Beach is asking $27.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The eight bedroom house, which measures roughly 14,600 square feet, was completed in 2009, according to listing agent Nelson Gonzalez of EWM Realty International. The roughly 1/2-acre lot on North Bay Road has about 124 feet of frontage on Biscayne Bay and a private dock, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mediterranean-style home has two courtyards, a gym and a wine cellar, Mr. Gonzalez said. Outside, an infinity pool and Jacuzzi overlook the bay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seller is Stuart Browning, founder of San Francisco-based <span class="companylink">Embarcadero Technologies</span>, which helps companies manage databases. Mr. Browning said he moved to Florida after his company went public in 2000, and purchased the property in 2004 for $3.5 million. He demolished the existing home on the site and said he spent nearly $11 million building a new one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Browning, 55, said he is downsizing now that two of his children are heading to college. In addition, he noted that with the hot market on North Bay Road -- "within walking distance of all the craziness" of South Beach -- now seems like the right time to sell.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—The number of homes tentatively sold across the U.S. fell in November, a sign the housing market hit a rough patch this winter after strengthening earlier in the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending home sales, measuring contracts before they become final, slipped 0.9% in November from a month earlier to a reading of 106.9, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Wednesday. An index of 100 is equal to the average level of contract activity during 2001, which the <span class="companylink">NAR</span> considers a “normal," or balanced, market for the current U.S. population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected sales to rise 0.5% last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending sales offer a forecast of the housing market because they measure purchases at the time a contract is signed rather than at closing. Contracts typically take weeks to become final, and some are ultimately canceled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending sales have slipped for three of the past four months but are up 2.7% over the past year, suggesting halting progress in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, the NAR's chief economist, attributed recent troubles in the housing market to a run-up in home prices and a persistent shortage in for-sale homes that have limited buyer options.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Home prices rising too sharply in several markets, mixed signs of an economy losing momentum and waning supply levels have acted as headwinds in recent months despite low mortgage rates and solid job gains," Mr. Yun said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other signs have heightened concerns. The <span class="companylink">NAR</span> reported earlier this month that its more closely watched index—final sales of existing homes, which measure purchases after closing—slid 10.5% in November[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-plunge-in-november-1450796974] to an annual rate of 4.76 million, a 19-month low. The <span class="companylink">NAR</span> pointed to delays caused by new federal rules, along with a tight supply of for-sale homes, as the primary factors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before last month, the housing sector showed strength, supported by broad job growth across the U.S., a rise in Americans' incomes and wealth, and historically low mortgage rates. Existing-home sales reached an annual pace of 5.58 million this summer, the highest level since late 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market faces a test after the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s move this month to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade. Higher mortgage rates could follow, though economists expect any increase to be slow and modest. Mortgage rates remain historically low, averaging 3.96% for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage last week, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Market conditions vary by region. Monday's report showed pending sales declined 3% in the Northeast and 5.5% in the West last month from the prior month. Sales rose 1% in the Midwest and 1.3% in the South.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price growth gained strength in October, according to a report released Tuesday, although other indicators suggest the pace of home sales has lost momentum as the year draws to a close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index covering the entire nation rose 5.2% in the 12 months ended in October, stronger than a 4.9% increase in September. Home price growth has steadily accelerated throughout 2015, underscoring that the housing market is returning to normal as the economy improves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-city index gained 5.1% from a year earlier, compared with a 4.9% increase in September. The 20-city index gained 5.5% year-over-year compared with 5.4% a month earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hottest markets, primarily on the West Coast, continued to show double-digit price gains, with San Francisco, Denver and Portland, Ore., all reporting 10.9% year-over-year gains. Twelve cities saw bigger year-over-year price increases in October than in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Suarez, a broker in Portland, said it would take less than two months to exhaust the supply on the market there, while nationally the supply of homes stands at more than five months -- a figure that the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> considers low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Suarez said recently he launched sales at a subdivision with 14 new homes, expecting them to sell for around $350,000. Instead, 12 of the 14 homes sold in two weeks for about $400,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand, he said, is being driven by younger people moving to the city and earning more than $100,000 a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After years of volatility, home-price growth appears to have stabilized at an annual rate of around 4% to 5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They look much more reasonable than the numbers we used to see," said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Zillow. "Overall 2015 was a good year to put a cap on all these crazy things that had been happening . . . with people really trying to bid up values."</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">More Deals Ahead in 2016 --- CBRE Group and JLL went on buying binge in 2015; is an IPO next for Cushman?</span>
</div><div class="author">By Peter Grant   </div><div>896 words</div><div>30 December 2015</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2015, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The world's largest commercial-real-estate-services firms cranked their mergers-and-acquisitions engines into high gear in 2015 and likely will keep their feet on the gas pedal well into the new year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">CBRE Group Inc</span>. and JLL, the largest and second-largest firms in the sector, respectively, have been on a binge buying brokerages and other commercial real estate that focus on geographic areas or niche businesses that the acquirers need. Many of the deals have been in the $10 million to $100 million price range, but 2015 deals also included CBRE's $1.47 billion acquisition of <span class="companylink">Johnson Controls Inc</span>.'s facilities-management business, Global Workplace Solutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, 2015 also saw the mother of all transactions in the industry, the $2 billion merger of <span class="companylink">Cushman &amp; Wakefield</span> and DTZ. The merged company, which took the <span class="companylink">Cushman &amp; Wakefield</span> name, is widely believed to be hoping to do an initial public offering in 2016 partly to put itself in a stronger position to compete against CBRE, JLL and others for acquisitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deal appetite is intense partly because the industry is morphing. Commercial-real-estate firms are trying to rely less on highly cyclical brokerage commissions and more on recurring fees paid by landlords, corporations and other clients for a range of consulting and management services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clients, meanwhile, are demanding that firms have a greater global reach and are able to tackle issues such as integrating real estate with technology and using real estate to improve productivity and morale. "These are big trends," said Brandon Dobell, an analyst with <span class="companylink">William Blair &amp; Co</span>. "The longer you are unable to make acquisitions or be aggressive in hiring people, the broader the divergence from your peers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big firms also are buying because these are good times in the commercial-real-estate business. Property sales activity and prices are at record levels in numerous markets. Tenants are expanding and leasing more space in countries that are enjoying economic recoveries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The resulting fees, commissions and other revenues have sent shares of JLL and CBRE soaring and given them plenty of cash to go shopping for smaller firms. Meanwhile, owners of the target companies are recognizing that now would be a good time to sell because buyers are willing to pay high prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's like when the house next to you sells for 'X,' you look at your wife and say we could get 'X' or better," said MitchGermain, an analyst with <span class="companylink">JMP Securities</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commercial-real-estate industry has been consolidating for more than 15 years as the business has become more global, but firms took a breather during the financial downturn. As the U.S. economy began recovering, the big firms picked up where they had left off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CBRE's acquisitions in 2015 included United Commercial Realty, a Dallas-based firm specializing in retail services; Environmental Services Inc. of Brookfield, Wis., which helps building owners and occupies manage energy usage; and PKF Consulting Inc., a Canadian consulting firm in the hospitality and tourism industries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just having an office in a country "doesn't get it done for clients" these days, said Bob Sulentic, CBRE's chief executive, in an interview earlier this month. "We're now saying [to clients], if you go to Mumbai you know you're going to have a full suite of products."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2014 and the first nine months of 2015, JLL announced or closed 25 transactions with a total value of more than $500 million. Deals included the acquisitions of Oak Grove Capital, a provider of multifamily lending services; <span class="companylink">Corrigo Inc</span>., a pioneer in cloud-based facilities-management technology; and Big Red Rooster, a retail-branding and design firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What's changing is the realization that you can use real estate more centrally as a tool for running your business," said Colin Dyer, JLL's CEO. "But to do so, you need professional advice that hasn't typically existed within the average company not focused on real estate."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Cushman &amp; Wakefield</span> had been an active buyer before its merger with DTZ, but slowed down since the closing in September. Management has been focusing since then on combining the two global firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts point out that <span class="companylink">Cushman &amp; Wakefield</span> might be limited in its ability to make acquisitions because it has more debt than JLL and CBRE. Also, because it isn't a public company, it doesn't have listed stock as an added incentive to offer owners of targeted firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is one of the reasons an IPO makes sense. "Their ability to really invest in the business is going to be constrained by how much debt they have," William Blair's Mr. Dobell said. "Selling shares to the public and reducing that debt load would give them more balance-sheet flexibility."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokeswoman for Cushman said in a written statement that the firm has a strong balance sheet and "more than sufficient capital available through cash flows produced by the business." She said that Cushman's owners "have shown a strong desire to also pursue larger M&amp;A through the provision of additional equity if we feel that is better and more efficient."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cleveland officer Timothy Loehmann shot Tamir after responding to a 911 call alerting officers that someone was holding what appeared to be an actual pistol.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the grand jury's decision was announced on Monday, Matthew Meyer, an assistant prosecutor, said the plastic-pellet gun had been modified by removing from its barrel an orange tip -- designed to indicate it wasn't a real firearm.

</div><div class="author">By Steven Russolillo   </div><div>413 words</div><div>28 December 2015</div><div>12:34</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Millennials appear to be in no rush to ditch their parents' homes. Perhaps they should be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More adults between ages 18 and 34 are now living with mommy and daddy than ever before, according to the Pew Research Center[http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2015/07/29/more-millennials-living-with-family-despite-improved-job-market/]. And the millennials who have fled the nest have increasingly become renters rather than buyers, a major reason the U.S. homeownership rate hit a 48-year low[http://blogs.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/economics/2015/07/28/u-s-homeownership-rate-hits-48-year-low/] earlier this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But times are changing. Job prospects are improving and wages are showing signs of breaking out[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-productivity-rises-2-2-in-third-quarter-1449063206]. Those factors alone suggest conditions are favorable for home buyers. Yet record levels of student debt[http://blogs.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/economics/2015/05/08/congratulations-class-of-2015-youre-the-most-indebted-ever-for-now/]are weighing on millennials and that could prompt them to miss out on a ripe opportunity to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider the coming S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index[http://us.spindices.com/index-family/real-estate/sp-case-shiller], due Tuesday. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal estimate home prices across the nation rose 5.2% in the 12 months ended in October, up from a 4.9% increase in the comparable period a month earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home values have been increasing recently at an annual clip of about 4% to 5%[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-home-price-growth-gains-momentum-in-september-case-shiller-says-1448373637], pushing prices closer to precrisis records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, that is good news for current homeowners. They reap the benefits of seeing home values appreciate by more than twice the rate of inflation. But that doesn't help a millennial skittish about becoming a first-time home buyer. Rising home values make it even more difficult to muster 20% for a down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Furthermore, the benefit of ultralow mortgage rates won't last forever. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage[http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/pmms30.htm] was still under 4% in December, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. With the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> expected to keep raising interest rates at a measured pace in 2016, they should move higher as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If, for instance, 30-year mortgage rates rise by one percentage point a year from now and home prices rise by another 5%, a monthly mortgage payment could jump by around 18%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising prices and interest rates may please the older generation, but not the one that hasn't yet begun climbing the property ladder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fear of missing out—or FOMO, as the kids say these days[http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=fomo]—should prompt millennials to act now.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Josh Barbanel   </div><div>863 words</div><div>28 December 2015</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A15</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2015, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan apartment prices reached new highs in 2015, with the typical price of a co-op or condominium topping $1 million for the first time as the year drew to a close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new benchmark, in the fourth quarter, was a milestone in the rising cost, and for many the unaffordability, of homeownership in New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many brokers and analysts attributed the marker to a surge in closings at expensive new buildings that have been under construction for years, including many deals signed months or even years ago. The rest of the market showed more modest prices gains and slower sales growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of celebrating the new benchmark, brokers described an alternative real estate universe in the second half of 2015: There were signs of a slowdown beginning in the summer, with a modest uptick late in the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of foreign buyers dropped, they said, while New York buyers became extremely price sensitive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is more supply and more headwinds in the market," with supply pressures varying from neighborhood to neighborhood, said Dolly Lenz, a broker in the luxury market. "Buyers have a whole lot of choices and they are voting with their dollars."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a Manhattan apartment rose to nearly $1.1 million, an increase of 13.5% from $965,000 from both the previous quarter and the fourth quarter of 2014, according to an analysis of city Department of Finance data by The Wall Street Journal. The average price also increased to a record of $1.9 million in the fourth quarter from $1.67 million in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all of 2015, the median price also set a record: $980,000, up 6.5% from $920,000 in 2014. Sales were up slightly too, by 2.1%, but below the sales pace in 2013. There were 12,872 sales in 2015, compared with 12,608 in 2014, based on sales filed with the city through Dec. 21 of each year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the brokers worried the current sales statistics don't necessarily reflect current conditions. In the fourth quarter, there were several hundred additional sales at newly marketed developments, some at high prices, including 67 for more than $5 million. Overall new development sales rose 80% from the fourth quarter of 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New apartments made up nearly 21% of sales in the fourth quarter, compared with 13% in the same quarter in 2014. As a result, 2015 is in line to be the biggest year in new development sales since 2008, with about $5.8 billion in sales so far, based on apartment sales documents filed with the city by Dec. 21.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discrepancy is caused by the long lag time between a contract signing for a new development and when the closing takes place, often months or years later than developers originally forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the early stages of the housing market recovery, the most expensive buildings for the most affluent buyers were the first to get financing. But even now after a run-up in prices, most less expensive apartments in what developers call "affordable luxury" are priced well above the $1.1 million benchmark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leonard Steinberg, the president of the brokerage firm Compass, said the real-estate market went into "a wait-and-see period" through October after uncertainty over the summer about the economic outlook here and world-wide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Steinberg said activity has picked up since then, after a wave of price cutting by many owners. "Sellers were learning that you are punished when you are too greedy," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the fourth quarter, the median condo price rose to a record of $1.7 million, while the average price rose to $2.6 million, also a record. At the same time, co-op prices were down slightly from the third quarter to roughly $710,800 from $715,000 in the fourth quarter of 2104.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Pamela Liebman, president of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, said after a slowdown in the fall, the market is now strong, but buyers have more choices in many neighborhoods, and are "much more cognizant of price."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They are still ready," she said. "When they see the value is there, they buy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the new developments contributing to the soaring median apartment price in Manhattan is The Greenwich Lane, on the site of the former St. Vincent's Hospital in Greenwich Village. The Rudin family and <span class="companylink">Global Holdings Inc</span>. developed the luxury condo project, which includes a blend of new construction and old buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first 12 of the Greenwich Lane's 199 condos and townhouses closed during the fourth quarter at an average price of $12.7 million, according to city records, including a $24.5 million penthouse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With 90% of the apartments now in contract, Bill Rudin, chief executive of Rudin Development, said with a limited supply of apartments in the neighborhood, the market remained strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"From our perspective we have not seen a slowdown," he said. "We have seen a very steady pace of lookers."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Sales of newly built U.S. homes rose last month and are on track for a solid 2015, though sales growth has softened in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of new single-family homes increased by 4.3%[https://www-census-gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/construction/nrs/index.html] to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 490,000 in November, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.[https://www-census-gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/construction/nrs/index.html (https:/www.census.gov/construction/nrs/index.html]
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">October's sales pace was revised down to 470,000 from an earlier estimate of 495,000; economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a November sales pace of 504,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“On balance, we view the data as consistent with our outlook for ongoing moderate gains in housing activity," Barclays economist Jesse Hurwitz said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales in November were up 9.1% from a year earlier. Sales rose 14.5% in the first 11 months of 2015 compared with the same period in 2014. Still, the pace of new-home sales has trended down since early 2015, averaging 467,000 over the past three months versus 517,000 in the first three months of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The new-home sales series has been choppy lately, but it looks like the trend has been softening since the peak of the expansion reported for February," J.P. Morgan Chase economist Daniel Silver said in a note to clients. “Some other sales-related measures have also been soft lately, but we still think that the housing market will continue to recover over time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of newly built homes account for only about 10% of the U.S. housing market, and data on new-home sales are volatile and subject to frequent revisions. In Wednesday's report, the margin of error on November's 4.3% monthly sales gain was 11.9 percentage points. There was a margin of error of 20.9 percentage points for the annual gain of 9.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes plunged in November, falling 10.5% from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.76 million, the slowest sales pace for existing homes since April 2014, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-plunge-in-november-1450796974].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, the Realtors group's chief economist, attributed much of last month's sales decline to new government regulations[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/new-federal-rules-for-mortgage-forms-accused-of-delaying-home-loans-1450742192] that he said have delayed closings. <span class="companylink">The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</span> in October introduced new mortgage forms and a requirement that lenders must give borrowers the final terms of a loan[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/new-federal-rules-for-mortgage-forms-accused-of-delaying-home-loans-1450742192] at least three business days before closing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">News Corp</span>, owner of The Wall Street Journal, also owns <span class="companylink">Move Inc</span>., which operates a website and mobile products for the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The November new-home sales data “add to the evidence that the sudden weakening in existing home sales was due to delays caused by new mortgage disclosure rules and not a change in the trend," High Frequency Economics chief U.S. economist Jim O'Sullivan said in a note to clients. “The new rules have delayed home sale closings, not initial agreements—existing home sales are based on closings, while new-home sales are based on initial agreements."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has been a solid year for residential construction[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-housing-starts-surge-10-5-in-november-1450273007], though home building remains far below prerecession levels. Housing starts rose 11% in the first 11 months of 2015 compared with the same period in 2014, the Commerce Department said last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Housing has been recovering very slowly," Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen said last week. “But the demographics would point to considerable upside for residential investment. My mainline forecast is for gradual recovery, but there is upside risk there."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed last week raised its benchmark short-term interest rate[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/fed-raises-rates-after-seven-years-at-zero-expects-gradual-tightening-path-1450292616] for the first time in nearly a decade, but signaled it plans to increase rates only gradually in the coming months and years, which could help blunt the impact on the housing sector. The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 3.97%, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> said last week, near historical lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Wednesday's report, there were 5.7 months of newly constructed homes available for sale in November at the current sales pace, down slightly from October's 5.8-month supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for new homes sold in November was $305,000, up 0.8% from a year earlier.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of previously owned homes plummeted in November as delays caused by new mortgage rules and a dwindling supply of residences on the market pushed down sales to a level not seen since April 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales fell 10.5% last month to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 4.76 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Tuesday, well below the 5.32 million economists expected. The double-digit decline was the sharpest since July 2010, when sales took a hit from the expiration of a home-buyer tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">NAR</span> blamed the bulk of the November decline on closing delays caused by new federal rules implemented by the <span class="companylink">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</span> in October, although it said rising home prices and tight inventory continued to challenge potential buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new rules, prompted by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial law, are meant to help consumers better understand the terms of their mortgages before they sign. As the industry adjusts, the changes have added about five days to the length of time to close home sales, NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun told reporters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several realtors said pressure on housing inventories is also driving the sales slump. The number of existing homes for sale fell more than 3% on the month in November and was down nearly 2% on the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think we're still seeing a fair amount of tightness in active selling markets," said Zillow Chief Economist Svenja Gudell, adding that first-time buyers trying to enter the market at a lower price point are facing particular scarcity. Housing prices have also climbed faster than wages in many markets, making it more difficult for first-time buyers to save for a down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November, the national median home price rose to $220,300, 6.3% higher than the same month last year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HONG KONG—Homeowners in this major Asian financial center are bracing for the impact of an increase in U.S. interest rates that could send a chill through the world's most expensive housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential home prices have been on a bull run for over a decade in Hong Kong, fueled by surging demand from mainland Chinese buyers, low mortgage rates and tight housing supply. The former British colony is known as a haven of tiny shoebox-sized apartments[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/in-hong-kong-the-apartments-are-fit-for-a-mosquito-1433237582] sold for eye-popping prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A flood of new housing units, announced by the government earlier this year to soothe property prices, is expected to push Hong Kong house prices down. Now, following the <span class="companylink">U.S. Federal Reserve</span>'s decision to raise interest rates[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/fed-raises-rates-after-seven-years-at-zero-expects-gradual-tightening-path-1450292616] from near zero, rising borrowing costs could be another catalyst to cool the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The underlying issue is one of affordability being very, very stretched," said Paul Louie, a Barclays property analyst. Rising rates would be “one of the trigger points" for a slump in prices, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hong Kong is particularly sensitive to U.S. monetary policy because its currency is tied to the U.S. dollar. Lending rates in the city typically track U.S. benchmark rates. <span class="companylink">The Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span> on Thursday raised its base interest-rate by 25 basis points following the Fed decision, with immediate effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hong Kong boasts the world's priciest homes by square foot, according to real-estate brokerage CBRE. As of September, buyers were paying on average $1,416 for each square-foot of housing, compared with $1,025 in London and $842 in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hong Kong government has periodically tried to cool a market that saw prices surge more than six times in the 12 years to August, said research firm Gavekal, for example by imposing higher stamp-duties on property purchases and tightening mortgage-lending rules in recent years, but tight supply has kept prices at record heights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are signs that prices have started to turn, however, even before the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s Wednesday decision. House prices jumped 23% in the year to early December compared with a year ago, hitting a peak in September, according to a <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> analysis of local real-estate data tracked by Hong Kong brokerage Centaline. Prices have softened 6% in the three months since.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts widely forecast a 5%-10% slump in luxury and mass home prices over the next year as new housing supply enters the market. About 22,000 new housing units will be completed each year over the next five years, pushing down home prices, according to brokerage Knight Frank. That compares with the 11,700 units on average a year over the last decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, some analysts attribute cooling home prices in Hong Kong more to slowing economic growth in Hong Kong and mainland China, as well as a Chinese government campaign against corruption and lavish spending that has caused Chinese buyers to pull back from the property market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The rise in the U.S. rate may not necessarily have a negative impact on the Hong Kong market," said Cusson Leung, head of Hong Kong and property research for <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span>. “We are at a juncture when we are negatively impacted by the China slowdown. At the same time, U.S. rates are also rising, so that's why potentially it may have a larger [effect] on the property market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Norman Chan, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, said last week that rising <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> interest rates meant Hong Kong could face capital outflows, slower economic growth, and lower property prices. A steady decline in property prices, however, would offer relief to prospective home buyers and business owners who are struggling to pay rent, he added. A spokesperson declined further comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Hong Kong, most mortgages are tied to the interbank lending rate that has remained low because of abundant liquidity in the financial system. Hong Kong banks have discretion whether to raise mortgage rates following a base interest-rate increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An increase in mortgage rates would strain the finances of Hong Kong homeowners servicing mortgages. The average Hong Kong family is sinking nearly half their income paying off the monthly mortgage bill, and an uptick in mortgage rates would increase the burden for existing homeowners, Mr. Leung said.</p>

Conference Board’s Leading Index Climbs in November; Barometer of economic activity climbs for second straight month</span>
</div><div class="author">By Lisa Beilfuss   </div><div>295 words</div><div>17 December 2015</div><div>10:24</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span>'s leading economic index climbed 0.4% last month, pushed higher by rising building permits and suggesting solid fourth-quarter growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The better-than-expected gain in the index follows a 0.6% increase in October. The robust back-to-back readings follow three months of lackluster prints.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal anticipated, on average, a 0.1% increase, though some projected an upside surprise after the Commerce Department on Wednesday reported an 11% jump in building permits during November. Permits are a bellwether for construction in coming months and they represent a chunk of the leading economic index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comprised of nine other components, ranging from the S&amp;P 500's price change to weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance and the yield curve, the index is meant to signal swings in the business cycle and to smooth out some of the volatility of individual components.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to building permits, the interest rate spread helped drive the December improvement, said Ataman Ozyildirim, director of business cycles and growth research at the board. A steeper yield curve resulted from the Fed's well-telegraphed message that it was likely to deliver a rate increase this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The coincident index, which comprises four series including nonfarm payrolls and which reflects current economic conditions, edged 0.1% higher in November after rising 0.2% in October. Growth in the coincident index usually follows the rate of the leading index with a lag.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index of lagging indicators, meanwhile, increased 0.3% in November after rising 0.2% in October.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders are stepping up construction broadly across the U.S., suggesting the housing market will help anchor the economy amid global turbulence and higher interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders broke ground on 1.173 million units, calculated at a yearly rate, in November, up 10.5% from a month earlier, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. Construction climbed at roughly the same pace in the first 11 months of the year, compared with the same period in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction is picking up not just in apartments but in single-family homes, too. Starts in the latter category -- reflecting two-thirds of the market -- reached a nearly eight-year high last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The across-the-board gains suggest builders are gaining confidence that home sales will remain steady, if not robust, over the next year, despite a rise in interest rates announced by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> Wednesday.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is a great deal of pent-up demand for housing," PNC senior economist Gus Faucher said in a note to clients.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sustained pickup in home construction would help boost the economy by creating construction jobs and demand for a host of goods, from wood paneling to sofas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's data gave encouraging signs on that front. Building permits rose 11% in November from October, to an annual pace of 1.289 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the latest momentum, home construction is hardly on a tear, remaining at less than half of its 2006 peak.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Builders are stepping up home construction broadly across the U.S., suggesting the housing market will help anchor the economy amid global turbulence and a likely rise in interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders broke ground on 1.173 million units, when calculated at a yearly rate, in November, up 10.5% from a month earlier, the Commerce Department said Wednesday[http://www.census.gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf]. Construction climbed at roughly the same pace in the first 11 months of the year compared with the same period in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a key development, construction is picking up not just in apartments but in single-family homes, too. Starts in the latter category—reflecting two-thirds of the market—reached a nearly eight-year high in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The across-the-board gains suggest builders are gaining confidence that home sales will remain steady, if not robust, over the next year despite the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates[http://blogs.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/briefly/2015/12/15/5-things-to-watch-at-the-fed-meeting/] at its policy meeting Wednesday. Mortgage rates could eventually rise as a result but are expected to remain at historically low levels for a while.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There is a great deal of pent-up demand for housing," PNC senior economist Gus Faucher said in a note to clients. “With steady job growth of around 200,000 per month, a falling unemployment rate, rising wages, very low mortgage rates, rising household formations, and better access to credit, demand for new homes is steadily improving."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sustained pickup in home construction would help boost the economy by creating construction jobs and demand for a host of goods, from wood paneling to sofas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's report offered several encouraging signs on that front. Building permits—a bellwether for construction in coming months—climbed 11% in November from October to an annual pace of 1.289 million. They are up 13.4% this year compared with last.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the latest momentum, home construction is hardly on a tear—it remains less than half of its 2006 peak. And building of multifamily units—apartments condominiums—continues to rise more quickly than single-family homes, suggesting many Americans remain constrained in their ability to borrow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market continues to face obstacles. Builders have reported shortages of land and labor[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-home-builder-confidence-slips-1450191603], leading to delays in projects' completion. Those delays often serve to push prices up, so the builder can recoup costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the market overall remains fairly strong, builders say the market has cooled in some areas of the country, largely because of the drop in oil prices and affordability concerns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Burns, who runs a builder consulting firm in Irvine, Calif., said that last month 19% of builders dropped prices when taking incentives into account. That partly reflects a seasonal slowdown, but also likely shows buyers are growing weary of the high price of buying a new home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The home builders have pushed their prices faster than the resale market and it's catching up with them," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Susan Maklari, an analyst at UBS Investment Bank, said the Houston market has dropped off because of lower oil prices, while in the other big Texas markets, Dallas and Austin, buyers have pulled back because the steep price run-ups in recent years were no longer sustainable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The whole state of Texas has had huge price appreciation," she said. “Buyers are saying this is just getting to a point where it's just not sustainable."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, luxury home builder Toll Brothers Inc. posted weaker-than-expected profit for its fourth quarter, underscoring that the market is continuing to recover more sluggishly than analysts hoped. Still, the company said new-home orders are up 21% in the first five weeks of its fiscal year 2016, compared with the same period last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Douglas Yearley, the company's chief executive, said the company has continued to see strong demand in California and Dallas and a number of other markets. But, he added, “Houston is slower, no question about it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts expect the recovery next year to remain modest. Mr. Burns said a survey of more than 200 home builder executives found that they expected only 6% more lots to be developed next year compared with this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in other parts of the country, builders say they are planning to ramp up construction in preparation for the spring selling season. Mark Ward, chief marketing officer at Raleigh, N.C.-based Shenandoah Homes, said he expects new construction in the North Carolina area to be strong. Currently, he said, they have about 2.5 months' supply of new homes, when closer to six months is normal.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans lost nearly $1.2 trillion in wealth in the third quarter as a shaky stock market contributed to one of the largest declines in household net worth since the economic recovery began, underscoring a risk to the growth outlook amid a multiyear bull run that has been tested this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the decline, chronicled in a <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> report released Thursday, the aggregate wealth in the U.S. remains near the highest levels ever recorded. The $85.2 trillion in net worth is down from the record $86.4 trillion recorded in the second quarter. By contrast, households had $66.5 trillion in net worth in 2007 before the recession started. At the low point of their recession, the wealth had dropped to $55 trillion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The third-quarter decline was driven mostly by a drop in households' holdings of stocks, which shed over $2.3 trillion in the quarter. Major stock indexes in the U.S. plunged sharply in late August. So far in the fourth quarter, stocks have regained most of their lost ground, so the decline in net worth may prove fleeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Consumers were reminded that stock markets are volatile, which also reminds them of the fragile nature of this recovery, the slow pace of this recovery," said Tim Hopper, the chief economist of the financial-services firm TIAA-CREF. Even if the drop proves fleeting, he said, it could still serve to shake consumers' confidence and postpone some spending on big-ticket items.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With sluggish economic growth and many mixed readings on the U.S. labor market, the surge in net worth had been one of the brightest spots in aggregate U.S. economic data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's report, known as the Flow of Funds, provides no breakdown of the distribution of this wealth. Though homeownership and stockownership rates are generally lower than before the recession, the yearslong rally in stock and home prices has helped boost the outlook for many families. That overall tailwind to the economy was absent for the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other assets posted modest increases that partially offset the decline in stocks. The value of real estate rose by $482 billion in the third quarter, as the market for homes in the U.S. continues its long but steady climb out of the doldrums of the bust. The overall value of households' real estate reached a new peak of $25 trillion, surpassing the $24.8 trillion recorded at the end of 2006. (See accompanying chart -- WSJ Dec. 11, 2015)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures are not adjusted for inflation, economic growth or the increase in the housing stock. Though housing construction has been depressed for much of the past decade, builders in the U.S. have still completed over 5 million new homes since the end of 2006. Average home prices remain about 13% below their 2006 peak, according to the Case-Shiller home-price index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The amount of money deposited in checking and savings accounts also climbed by $132 billion, reaching a total of $10.4 trillion. Debt securities, such as bonds, rose in value by $116 billion to about $3.4 trillion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as American wealth has climbed to record levels, it hasn't provided the same economic boost as in the past. Before the housing crisis, rising home and stock prices led to a buoyant mood for consumers and prompted additional consumer spending. Economists' estimates of these so-called wealth effects have shrunk, as many consumers remain shell-shocked from the recession and housing bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wall Street Journal's economic survey found that half of economists believe wealth effects are notably smaller than a few years ago, compared to just 8% who think they are larger. The rest judge them to be about the same.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The rising tide of home equity wealth is not lifting consumption boats as high this cycle," said Sean Snaith, the director of the University of Central Florida's Institute for Economic Competitiveness.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A small group of wealthy Chinese investors recently poured $10 million into a luxury condominium project in New York's Westchester County. The redbrick building, set to open next year, will feature a pool and a roof deck offering sweeping views of the Hudson River.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of the people bothered to visit the site before plunking down their money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was a relatively easy deal," said Rick Singer, a New York real-estate investor who introduced the Chinese investors to the project's developer. "It gave the Chinese what they wanted."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The investors' objective, in part, was to move money out of China and into U.S. commercial property, said brokers who have arranged similar deals for wealthy Chinese in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That goal became more pressing over the summer, after a plunging stock market rattled investors and a sharply slowing economy prompted Chinese officials to devalue the nation's currency. Authorities beefed up enforcement of rules designed to keep money from exiting the country. Many wealthy Chinese worry that Beijing could strip them of their wealth or inflate away their savings by cheapening the currency further, brokers said. That motivates them to move large sums outside the country, ideally without drawing attention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China has been the largest foreign holder of U.S. Treasurys since 2008, but more recently its buying interest in the U.S. has spread to Chinese companies and wealthy individuals. A Chinese insurer earlier this year paid $1.95 billion for New York's Waldorf Astoria hotel -- a record price for a U.S. hotel sale -- after Chinese regulators relaxed rules for big insurers investing in overseas real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wealthy Chinese also have been eager to buy houses or apartments in the U.S. After a five-year spending binge, Chinese displaced Canadians as the top foreign buyers of U.S. homes for the 12 months to March, according to the most recent data from the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While wealthy Chinese home buyers have pulled back on U.S. purchases in recent months amid the market turmoil at home, investors looking for commercial property have kept buying aggressively, brokers said. Many have centered on unlikely investments such as small office buildings, chain hotels and other nondescript properties in and around big U.S. cities, seizing an opportunity to place greater sums of money outside their government's reach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past couple of years, Chinese investors have acquired a strip mall near Long Beach, Calif., a Marriott hotel near Los Angeles International Airport and a waterfront office building on New York's Staten Island, according to property records, brokers and other parties in the deals. They have helped fund at least two big condo projects in Westchester County and purchased large swaths of property in the Queens, N.Y., neighborhood of Elmhurst, according to the people and property records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It isn't just about finding yield, but about parking their capital," said Joshua Zegen, co-founder at New York-based Madison Realty Capital. His firm made a loan to the developer of a $100 million luxury apartment development in Queens that counts wealthy Chinese among its investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big Chinese companies have been piling into glitzy U.S. commercial property in recent years, paying record sales prices for the Waldorf Astoria and Baccarat hotels in New York and planning one of the tallest buildings in San Francisco. Those types of deals could suffer if the Chinese government continues an effort launched amid the stock-market rout to discourage companies from investing heavily abroad instead of at home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's middle-class families, meanwhile, have received attention for their purchases of individual homes and condo units in U.S. cities. Those transactions could be cooling, too, brokers say, as Beijing tries to keep money from exiting the country. Individuals can invest up to $50,000 a year overseas, and officials vowed to enforce those laws strictly following China's stock-market plunge in the summer. Chinese shares have since recovered some of the lost ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wealthy individual investors, by contrast, have long flouted the rules by sending capital to the U.S. through family and friends, wealth advisers and private bankers say. Some have export-oriented businesses, which pay them in dollars that they keep overseas through real estate and other investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data released Monday showed China's foreign-exchange reserves fell in November to their lowest in more than two years, fueling concerns about Beijing's ability to stem capital outflows.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every day for the past six months, Brian Christopher closely observed a swooning loonie. Mr. Christopher, 34, isn't a bird nut: He's a Canadian who was trying to buy a home in Los Angeles, and facing a sharply depreciating Canadian dollar. "I've just watched it get worse and worse," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Down about 10% over the past year, the falling Canadian dollar (also known as a "loonie," due to the image of a loon on the dollar coin) is shifting the landscape of foreign buyers in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the first time, Chinese have overtaken Canadians as the biggest foreign purchasers of U.S. property by total number of transactions, accounting for 16% of sales to international buyers in the 12 months ending March 2015, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. Canadians accounted for 14% -- down from 23% in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agents say the biggest drop is in the lower end of the market, where Canadians have traditionally bought condos and smaller homes in cities like Honolulu and Orlando as investments. These buyers swooped in when the U.S. housing market crashed and the Canadian dollar was much stronger. Now, with the Canadian dollar trading at about 75 cents U.S., many are selling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the high end of the market hasn't been affected as much, say agents in Florida, California and Arizona -- the three states with the most Canadian buyers. "We are seeing fewer buyers overall but the buyers we are seeing are purchasing at a higher price point," says Diane Olson, a Scottsdale, Ariz.-based real-estate agent with a number of Canadian clients. She just closed on a home sale over $1 million to a Canadian buyer in Scottsdale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Doyle, a finance executive in St. John's, Newfoundland, says he wasn't discouraged by the unfavorable exchange rate. In August, he bought a four-bedroom, 3,700-square-foot house in Sarasota, Fla., for $400,000. He plans to add a pool, and says he is looking at a long-term approach. "You can't really worry if the dollar goes up or down. It's great to invest in real estate, but it's also important to invest in life. It's about the memories you make there," he says. Mr. Doyle, 51, says he would have preferred to have purchased the house a few years ago, when the Canadian dollar was at par with the U.S. dollar and prices for homes in Florida were cheaper. But he said he wants to eventually retire in Florida and decided to go ahead now in case the situation gets even worse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The combination of the weaker Canadian dollar and higher home prices in Florida means Canadians are paying more than they would have five years ago (an average of $400,000 instead of $300,000) and getting less, says Brent Leathwood, an agent with Cross Border Realty in Venice, Fla. "They're kicking themselves, but they're still buying," he says of his Canadian clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to real-estate website realtor.com, searches by Canadians for properties in the U.S. on the site over the past year fell for moderately priced homes and increased for higher priced homes. "There's a material difference this year compared to last year," says realtor.com economist Jonathan Smoke. The company's data also show a shift in where Canadians are searching. Page views were up for New York, Cambridge, Mass., and Kennebunkport, Maine, and many areas of Hawaii -- markets where home prices tend to be high. Page views were down for Detroit, Whitefish, Mont., and Hollywood, Fla., where home prices are generally lower. (<span class="companylink">News Corp</span>, which owns The Wall Street Journal, also owns realtor.com.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim Schneider, principal broker at the Kukio Real Estate Company, says business has been steady from Canadians buying homes in Kukio, the area of Hawaii's Big Island where Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz bought a $25 million home in August. He adds that Canadians tend to buy on word of mouth from compatriots. "It's a lot of friends of friends," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sean Jones, founder of Vancouver-based Spence Diamonds, bought a half-acre lot in Kukio for $3.4 million in March, according to public records. Mr. Jones, who declined to comment, is currently listing his house in Vancouver for $36.8 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim Treliving, who lives in Vancouver and owns the Canadian restaurant chain <span class="companylink">Boston Pizza International</span>, bought a 1.18 acre lot in Kukio earlier this year for $1.5 million. Mr. Treliving is headed to Kukio in January to meet with contractors about the house he plans to build on the property. He says his building plans will not be affected by the depreciating Canadian dollar. "Hawaii is a great investment," he says. "In two or three years the exchange rate could change. My investment will be there for a long time. You might take a hit going in but then when you sell it you get it back."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other recent buyers are slightly more cautious. Scott Ratushny, chairman and CEO of Calgary-based Cardinal Energy Ltd., bought a Kukio lot in June for $1 million, according to public records. He says he intends to build a home there, but has delayed due to conditions in the oil market and the weak Canadian dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some Canadians continue to wait to see if the Canadian dollar will strengthen before they buy a home, says David Ivkovic, a Canadian by birth who is a realtor with <span class="companylink">Keller Williams Realty</span> in Studio City, Calif. "Others just suffer the loss," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for Mr. Christopher, he finally bit the bullet and bought a Los Angeles home, despite the swooning loonie. Mr. Christopher, an actor, and his husband Marco Bianchi, a tech executive, closed on a three-bedroom house with a nice view in Baldwin Hills for about $995,000 in October. Of the loonie, he says, "We were hoping until the last minute it would go back up."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto   </div><div>427 words</div><div>3 December 2015</div><div>21:36</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising home values helped more underwater homeowners surface in the third quarter, but some of the areas worst hit by the housing crash are continuing to struggle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly 1 million fewer homeowners were underwater—meaning they owed more than their homes are worth—in the third quarter of 2015 compared with the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This summer, 13.4% of homeowners across the country were underwater, down from 16.9% a year ago, according to Zillow, a real-estate information company. Typically, the proportion of homeowners underwater is closer to 2% to 5%, according to Zillow. But today only San Jose and San Francisco have fewer than 5% of buyers underwater, at 3% and 4.7% respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas, which has had the highest percentage of homeowners underwater for the past 4½ half years, remained on top. Just over 22% of homeowners in the gambling town still owe more than their homes are worth. Las Vegas is followed by Chicago at 20.6% and Atlanta at 18.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the worst-hit markets also saw the biggest improvement in recent years. In Atlanta, the share of underwater homeowners dropped 8.5 percentage points compared with a year ago. In Las Vegas, the drop was 5.6 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In these markets, there are just so many people that are underwater that if you're blanketing them with home-value appreciation they are much more likely to see larger drops in that negative equity rate," said Zillow chief economist Svenja Gudell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The large number of buyers still underwater in some areas is particularly troubling because it's difficult for owners to sell their homes without having to resort to a short sale, which can damage their credit and make it difficult for them to obtain a mortgage for a few years afterward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising home prices have helped pull many buyers out from being underwater in recent years. Home prices nationwide rose 4.9% in the 12 months ended in September, stronger than a 4.6% increase in August, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many cases, the homes that remain underwater are lower-priced homes that are more affordable for first-time buyers, who have been buying homes in anemic numbers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“A lot of these homeowners can't sell and first-time buyers can't buy a house," Ms. Gudell said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">0438 GMT [<span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span>] The Hang Seng Index edges up 0.3% higher to 22,442 Wednesday on positive investor sentiment that the Fed might delay raising U.S. interest rates in December. Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen is expected to give a speech later Wednesday about the rates decision. Property stocks rose after data released Tuesday showed new home prices in mainland China increased for the seventh month in a row. Investor expectations have also been rising for more stimulus from Chinese authorities that would benefit the housing market. Greenland Hong Kong (0337.HK) gained 5% and <span class="companylink">Joy City Property</span> (0207.HK) rose 4.3%. “The strong Australian third quarter GDP numbers and the positive open of the Chinese cash markets helped pare back some of the earlier losses" across Asia markets, IG says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sale Gives Railroad</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Late Reprieve</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A last-minute sale of the bankrupt Apache Railway in rural Arizona is expected to keep the 55-mile railroad operating, alleviating the fears of local leaders who worried that the region's economic lifeline would shut down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Judge Madeleine C. Wanslee of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Phoenix cleared a group of investors and a local landowner to purchase the railroad for roughly $7 million. The sale proceeds will pay off a lender group led by California-based <span class="companylink">Hackman Capital Partners</span>, an industrial real-estate investor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale closed Monday, the railway owner's lawyer, Rob Charles, told The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Built in 1917, the railroad, which employs 21 people, connects the town of Snowflake with a bigger rail line in Holbrook in Navajo County. Hackman obtained the railroad when it agreed to buy an empty paper mill near the town for $13.5 million in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The paper mill's closure left the rail line with just one customer: a 160-worker hog farm for pork giant <span class="companylink">Hormel Foods</span> that gets 90 railcars of feed a month.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before approving the plan on Nov. 20, planning commission members asked Mr. Deming to further develop his design to include some safety features and a smaller base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The monument is estimated to cost $3 million or more and would be privately funded.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—The number of existing homes that went under contract in the U.S. inched up in October, a sign the housing market remains stable heading into the final months of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An index measuring pending home sales—a gauge of purchases before they become final—rose 0.2% to a seasonally adjusted reading of 107.7 in October, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Monday. An index of 100 is equal to the average level of contract activity during 2001.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had predicted a 1.5% increase in October sales. September's reading was revised to a 1.6% decline from an initially estimated 2.3% drop. The index peaked for the year in May and has mostly edged down since.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It typically takes a month or two for a home purchase to be completed. When the sale is finalized, it is registered in the Realtors' more closely watched existing-home sales report. That report showed sales of previously owned homes, roughly 90% of the overall housing market, reached a post-recession peak of a 5.58 million annual pace in July, and hovered slightly below that level this fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The industry group said the pace of sales plateaued in recent months because buyers are finding a small number of available homes and prices are rising quickly in some markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In the most competitive metro areas—particularly those in the South and West—affordability concerns remain heightened as low inventory continues to drive up prices," said Lawrence Yun, the NAR's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supported by historically low interest rates on mortgage loans and steady hiring, the housing market has been a bright spot for the economy this year. Home purchases signal that consumers have confidence in the economy, and typically coincide with increased spending on appliances, furniture and home improvements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists are watching the sector to see if it can maintain momentum in the face interest rates increasing from record lows and a limited selection of homes pushing up prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday's report showed pending home sale were up 3.9% from a year earlier in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the month, sales increased in the Northeast and West, but fell in the South and Midwest.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">U.S. Federal Reserve</span> isn't exactly poised to crash the house party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low interest rates, steady job gains and improving household finances have helped bolster the housing recovery. And even as 2015's strong first half has given way to some wobbly months of late, housing fundamentals appear primed to withstand a looming U.S. rate increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday'sreport on pending home sales, a key tool in measuring buying momentum, should confirm that trend. Tracked by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>, it measures purchases of previously owned homes and is based on signed contracts, making it a leading indicator of sorts for the broader housing market. Home sales typically close within a couple months after signing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While pending home sales hita nine-year high in May, they have slipped on a monthly basis in three of the past four months. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal expect a 1.5% risein October from a month earlier. And the year-over-year trend remains positive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent stretch evokes fears of what transpired in mid-2013, following the so-called taper tantrum. Back then, interest rates spiked and home sales slumped as the Fed indicated it could start to cut back on monetary stimulus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage surged by over a percentage point from April through August in 2013. And pending home sales peaked that June before falling 12% by year's end. Only this February did pending home sales bounce back to June 2013 levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The taper tantrum caught markets by surprise. Today, there is little shock value in the expected rate increase. And housing conditions remain favorable ahead of the Fed's big move. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 3.8% in October, the lowest since April, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loosening of credit conditions also has helped housing. <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and Freddie Maccut down-payment standardslate last year. The <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span> this yearreduced the premium it chargesfor insuring mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher rates are coming, perhaps in a few weeks. Don't expect them to take an immediate toll on housing.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices continue to climb, but the <span class="companylink">U.S. government</span> is keeping a lid on the size limit for federally backed mortgages, posing problems for home buyers in many pricey markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> on Wednesday said mortgage-finance giants <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> in most markets next year can back only loans of $417,000 or less. It will mark the 11th straight year that limit has been in place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The highest-cost areas, which include cities such as San Jose, Calif., San Francisco and New York, will keep a limit of $625,500, while 39 counties will see increases of $5,750 to $34,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first nine months of the year, so-called jumbo mortgages -- those that exceed the government limits -- made up nearly 19% of the market, according to trade publication Inside Mortgage Finance. That was up from a low of 5.5% in 2009 and is the highest market share since the government last raised the loan limit in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In most parts of the U.S., where the median home price is $219,600, the federal mortgage limit isn't an issue. But in some California cities and others with fast-rising home values, the limit is starting to weigh on the market, real-estate agents and economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If we don't get an increase in the high-cost loan limit, it's going to be very disappointing," said Leslie Appleton-Young, chief economist for the California Association of Realtors, before the new limits were announced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest 2016 limit increases in dollar terms occurred in the Denver area, where home prices have risen 11% in the past year, according to S&amp;P Case-Shiller. Many counties around Nashville, Tenn., also will see increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hot housing markets in California hit the maximum $625,500 limit before this year and as a result have seen more borrowers turn to jumbos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than half of San Jose's for-sale listings in September have asking prices that would require a jumbo loan assuming the borrower made a 25% down payment, according to an analysis for The Wall Street Journal by real-estate information site Zillow. The same could be said for about 44% of listings in San Francisco, 36% in Los Angeles and 35% in San Diego.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside of California, about 28% of listings met those criteria in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale and Denver metros as well as 23% of listings in Austin, Texas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For most buyers, moving from a government-backed mortgage to a jumbo doesn't result in a big hit on interest rates. Wells Fargo Corp.on Tuesday, for example, advertised a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rate of 4.125% or slightly higher for government-backed loans and 3.75% for jumbos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, the hurdle for many borrowers is the higher qualifications that can come with getting a jumbo mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Fannie and Freddie allow for a down payment of as low as 3% in some circumstances, many jumbo lenders don't allow a down payment below 10% or 15%. A borrower's credit score also typically has to be higher when he or she gets a jumbo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mathew Carson of mortgage broker First Capital Group in San Francisco, said nearly four out of five home buyers he works with now need a jumbo mortgage, up from less than half of borrowers five years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Carson said buyers in his area, who often come from the high-paying tech industry, frequently have the income to pay a jumbo loan but don't have the large down payment or six to 12 months of mortgage payments in reserves that the loans require.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You can't find anything decent in San Francisco for under a million bucks. With 20% down, you're at $800,000. That is not even close to the conforming limit," Mr. Carson said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Police Shooting Video</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sparks Protests</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hundreds of protesters took to the streets following the release of a graphic video Tuesday showing a black teenager being fatally shot by a white police officer who has been charged with first-degree murder in the death of the 17-year-old in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The protesters marched in a mostly peaceful procession through the city Tuesday night, shutting down streets and stopping traffic. Demonstrators with bullhorns led the march in chants of "16 shots" -- the number of times Laquan McDonald was hit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were some scuffles with police, and officers made five arrests. Activists said they are planning further demonstrations for Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McDonald died on Oct. 20, 2014, after police responded to reports of a man breaking into vehicles. On Tuesday, Officer Jason Van Dyke, 37 years old, was charged in his death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The video shows Mr. McDonald jogging down the middle of a street. He slows to a walk as he approaches two police cruisers that have pulled in ahead of him. He is holding a small knife at his side. Two officers get out of one of the vehicles and point their guns at Mr. McDonald as the teen veers away from them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McDonald is a car lane's width away when Mr. Van Dyke opens fire, the bullets twisting the teen's body and sending him to the ground. Puffs of smoke can be seen rising from his body, which prosecutors say is from the officer's continued gunfire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of the other officers at the scene opened fire on Mr. McDonald. Police later recovered a knife with a 3-inch blade, prosecutors said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Sales of newly built homes rose in October, leaving the housing market on track for its best year since 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of new single-family homes rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 495,000 in October, the Commerce Department said Wednesday, up 10.7% from September's revised 447,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The October rebound follows reports of renewed sales momentum for many home builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Taylor Morrison Home Corp</span>. reported a 15% increase in October sales from a year earlier, while <span class="companylink">CalAtlantic Group Inc</span>. posted an 8% increase. <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton Inc</span>. reported “solid" sales in October, and <span class="companylink">Meritage Homes Corp</span>. noted that its October sales were up more than 20%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toronto-based builder Mattamy Homes, which operates in Florida, North Carolina, Minnesota and Arizona, posted a frothy 93% increase in October sales in the U.S. from a year ago to 164 last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I don't think people are jumping off the fence because of an [impending] increase in interest rates," Mattamy COO Brian Johnston said in an interview. “It's more about just doing better. It's more jobs. It's the confidence level. It's that fewer buyers are underwater on their homes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> is widely expected to raise its benchmark interest rate from near zero in December, a move that could lead to higher mortgage rates for many borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 3.95% in the week ending Nov. 25, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> said, not far off from the 3.97% rate a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Oakwood Homes LLC</span>, a closely held builder operating in Colorado and Utah, saw a more modest 7% gain in its October sales to 69. Oakwood Chief Executive Pat Hamill said his sales people are encouraging buyers to purchase homes ahead of the Fed's anticipated increase in interest rates in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The first-time home buyer market is very strong," Mr. Hamill said. “There's been a little softness above the $500,000 price point, but our average selling price is about $350,000. We've actually had to stop selling in our two most affordable communities because we were just selling too far out in advance."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Nationwide</span>, October's pace of newly built home sales is up 4.9% from a year earlier, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were 5.5 months' supply of newly built homes in October, down from 6 months in September. The median sales price of new homes was $281,500, down 6% from $299,400 in October 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Official new-home sales figures are volatile and frequently revised. October's headline number has a margin of error of plus or minus 17.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the broad trend suggests steady improvement for the housing market. The year-to-date rate of new home sales, not seasonally adjusted, is up 15.7% from the same period a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And homes appear to be moving quickly, with the median number of months for sale falling to 2.8 in October, the shortest span on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales, which constitute 90% of the market, are also expected to reach their best sales level in eight years in 2015. But that market has been challenged by rising prices and low inventories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of existing-home sales fell 3.4% in October from September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.36 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Monday.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto   </div><div>591 words</div><div>24 November 2015</div><div>10:00</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home price growth accelerated in September, according to a report released Tuesday, underscoring concerns that lofty price gains are helping to keep some buyers out of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index, covering the entire nation, rose 4.9% in the 12 months ended in September, stronger than a 4.6% increase in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-city index gained 5% from a year earlier, compared with a 4.7% increase in August. The 20-city index gained 5.5% year-over-year compared with 5.1% a month earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected a 5.2% increase in the 20-city index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home prices and housing continue to show strength with home prices rising at more than double the rate of inflation," said David Blitzer, managing director at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists have cautioned that prices also are growing roughly twice as fast as incomes, potentially keeping younger buyers out of the market. Mr. Blitzer said the median home price remains affordable to a typical family, when factoring in very low mortgage rates, although affordability has worsened recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After years of volatility, home price growth appears to have stabilized at an annual rate of around 4% to 5%. Economists said prices, sales and new-home construction are likely to continue to grow moderately going into next year as the market continues its return to normal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We expect solid employment growth and modest wage increases to continue to support the housing market," Rob Martin, an analyst at Barclays Research, said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hottest markets in the country continued to show double-digit price gains. In San Francisco prices were up 11.2%, in Denver they rose 10.9%, and in Portland they grew 10.1%. Phoenix continued the longest streak of year-over-year price increases, with a 5.3% gain in September marking 10 months of gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Month-over-month price gains were also fairly strong. Not seasonally adjusted, the U.S. Index rose 0.2% from August to September. The 10-city and 20-city indexes also both rose 0.2% over the month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After seasonal adjustment the national index was up 0.8%. The 10-city and 20-city composite were both up 0.6% over the month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Case-Shiller offers one of the clearest indicators of how home prices are faring, but also provides a delayed picture. More recent indicators show that the pace of home sales slowed considerably in October, which many economists blamed on rising prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes fell in October after a September surge, as rising home prices and a lack of inventory challenged potential buyers, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. The pace of existing-home sales fell 3.4% in October from September to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 5.36 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markets in the West and the South, which have seen some of the strongest price gains suffered the most, indicating that affordability is a concern. Economists said that particularly if mortgage rates that could make it even more difficult for people to afford homes in those areas and slow sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The threat of rising interest rates may soon put a damper on housing affordability, especially in hotter, coastal markets," said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Zillow.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is on track to have its best year since 2007, but two reports released on Monday underscored that weak patches remain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes fell in October after a September surge, as rising home prices and a lack of inventory challenged potential buyers. Meanwhile, more children are living with their parents than during the 2007-09 recession, an indicator that young adults aren't striking out on their own despite substantial improvement in the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of existing-home sales fell 3.4% in October from September to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 5.36 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales have slowed especially in pricey markets, such as California, where younger and middle-income buyers had struggled to get into the market. Housing markets that are dependent on oil, such as Houston, Texas and parts of Louisiana and North Dakota, have also suffered amid a plunge in oil prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales fell 3.2% in the South and 8.7% in the West, while the Northeast was flat and the Midwest saw a small 0.8% decline, according to <span class="companylink">NAR</span>. Home prices in the West have shot up 8% since October 2014, and are up 6.2% in the South from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm very worried about affordability," said Leslie Appleton-Young, chief economist for the California Association of Realtors. She said the market is being "choked" by the inability of entry-level and middle-income buyers to afford homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another clue that affordability could constrain home sales going forward: Sales at the lower end of the market, homes costing $100,000 or less, dropped by 9.1% from a year ago, although this could also reflect a decline in distressed sales. Sales at the mid-to-upper end of the range were all higher from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national median home price fell slightly from September to $219,600, 5.8% higher than October 2014, marking the 44th consecutive month in which prices nationally have risen year-over-year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend of young people continuing to live with their parents despite improving job prospects could damp demand for both rental and for-sale housing in the coming months and years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The share of 18- to 34-year-olds living with their parents was 31.5% as of March 2015, up from 31.4% last year, according to a report from the Commerce Department on Monday. In 2005, just 27% of young adults lived with their parents, a number that has climbed pretty steadily since then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The long-term demographic shifts suggest this might be the new normal, with young people living with their parents longer and more permanently delaying household formation and homeownership," said Jed Kolko, an independent economist and senior fellow at the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at the <span class="companylink">University of California, Berkeley</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wilbur L. Ross Jr., the billionaire investor in distressed assets, has stepped in to purchase a long-troubled, 14-room apartment at River House that has lingered on the market for most of the last eight years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The purchase price for the duplex co-op on the East Side was $7.8 million, according an order signed Tuesday by a judge in federal bankruptcy court in Manhattan, approving the sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move by Mr. Ross and his wife, Hilary Geary Ross, a socialite and writer on high society, seems likely to spark interest in River House, a stylish art-deco complex built in 1931 on the East River and East 52nd Street that has struggled in recent years to shed a dowdy, standoffish image, brokers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ross made an offer to buy the five-bedroom, 5,000-square-foot apartment after a deal for $8 million with another buyer was rejected by the co-op board in mid-October, according to court papers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ross purchase at River House is going forward at a time when the co-op board has taken steps to be more welcoming to brokers and buyers, especially younger buyers with families, to strengthen home values and resale prices in the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The co-op recently told shareholders it had reached a new long-term lease with the River Club, a large private club, with two tennis courts, a pool and a squash court and guest rooms, located in the base of the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the deal, all co-op owners would be eligible for membership at the newly refurbished club, and all would have access to a new shared gym.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ross, who is 77 years old, had tried to buy an apartment at River House decades ago. In the mid-1990s, he was turned down by the River House board, when he sought to buy a co-op there with his then-wife Betsy McCaughey, who was then the high-profile lieutenant governor of New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ross said that he bought the apartment at River House now "because it has spectacular views and great bones."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he had many friends there "so we are familiar with its wonderful ambience."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The co-op has a 30-foot-wide living room, a large dining room, a library, kitchen, entrance gallery and a separate private wing up upstairs, according to the listing by Richard J. Steinberg of <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>. The asking price was $8.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is owned by Arlene Farkas, the former wife of Bruce Farkas, an heir of the long-gone Alexander's department store chain. She has lived there for 46 years. But after the couple separated in 1990, they fought over title to the apartment in a court battle that continued for 18 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was listed for $15 million in 2008 by a succession of brokers over the years, and the asking price fell over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, it appeared that Ms. Farkas's ordeal was over when she found a buyer for it. But the co-op board rejected her buyer, and then a second one, four month later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February, Ms. Farkas, facing a foreclosure on her apartment by a bank holding a $4.3 million reverse mortgage, filed for bankruptcy to avoid a distress sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">River House became a premier New York address when it opened. It included a dock on the East River where owners could tie up their yachts. Its current roster of residents include Henry Kissinger and Uma Thurman, the actress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, Jeremy Jacobs, the billionaire owner of the <span class="companylink">Boston Bruins</span> hockey team, bought a four-bedroom apartment for $10.35 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, Mr. Ross listed his current home, a 13th-floor penthouse condo with a 75-foot-long terrace facing south, at the Briarcliff on West 57th Street and Seventh Avenue. It is one door down from One57, a 1,004-foot-high glass tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked if he was moving because of One57, Mr. Ross said that his penthouse had "great light" and extraordinary entertainment spaces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said that One57 was a great benefit, since the "reflective surface of the new building" fills his west-facing dining room with light, "especially at breakfast."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- New-home construction sank in October, as builders dialed back on building of apartments and condominiums that drove demand through much of the summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts fell 11% from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.06 million in October, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. Starts of single-family homes, which make up nearly two-thirds of the market, fell 2.4%. Construction of multifamily units, including apartments and condominiums, plunged 25.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New applications for building permits, a bellwether for future home construction, rose 4.1% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.15 million. Single-family permits rose to their highest level since December 2007, and were up in every region but the Northeast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home construction figures can be volatile, and are typically revised. Wednesday's report showed starts increased 6.7% in September, up slightly from a previously reported 6.5% gain. Wednesday's housing starts figures also came with a 13.5% margin of error.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Looking through the month-to-month volatility, we expect starts to increase at a sustained but moderate pace, supporting the housing recovery and construction activity," Barclays economist Blerina Uruci said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has been building momentum this year after a lackluster performance in the early years of the recovery. Still, construction activity is well below its prerecession levels, which economists suggest may be holding back sales of new homes, constraining the supply of homes on the market and in turn pushing up prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Labor shortages have also plagued construction companies, making it hard to get homes off the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's report showed housing starts rose a seasonally adjusted 10.2% in the Northeast and 15% in the Midwest. Starts were down 18.6% in the South and 16.2% in the West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the challenges that most builders encountered with labor shortages and delays from an unusually wet spring in much of the south, <span class="companylink">David Weekley Homes</span> registered 10% more construction starts in October than a year earlier. Houston-based Weekley, which built roughly 3,000 homes in 12 states last year, appears to have finally worked through the delays it incurred early this year when persistent rainfall in Texas and elsewhere in the south stymied efforts to get home lots ready for construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of our communities were delayed during the year, and we're getting more of them open [now]," David Weekley Chief Executive John Johnson said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Copper prices fell Wednesday, extending their six-year lows, as weaker U.S. home starts and signs that China's property market is losing steam fanned concerns about demand for the industrial metal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most actively traded copper futures contract, for December delivery, was recently down 1.55 cents, or 0.7%, at $2.0885 a pound on the Comex division of the <span class="companylink">New York Mercantile Exchange</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Copper prices have been pummeled to six-year lows by fears that China's economy is slowing[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/chinas-economy-shows-further-signs-of-fragility-1447834276] at a time when growth in other regions remains fragile, tarnishing traders' outlook on metal demand. China is the world's top copper consumer, driving 40% of demand, while the U.S. is second in line. Copper is widely used in everyday goods like iPhones and air conditioners, and demand for the metal is closely linked to the pace of global business activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese home prices increased by just 0.07%[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/china-new-home-prices-rise-1447813628] in October, a slowdown from the 0.2% rise in September, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. Home prices rose in 27 out of 70 Chinese cities in October, down from 39 in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The recent data coming out of China has been less than stellar and that continues to weigh on sentiment about demand," said Dave Meger, director of metals trading with High Ridge Futures in Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, U.S. housing starts fell 11%[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-housing-starts-fall-11-in-october-1447853742] in October from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.06 million, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Applications for building permits, an indicator of future home building activity, rose 4.1% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.15 million. Economists predicted housing starts to reach 1.16 million and permits to hit a rate of 1.14 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stronger permits data helped dull the sting of the steep drop in new construction, said Bill O'Neill, co-founder of commodities investment company Logic Advisors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, “housing has been something of a bright spot," he said, adding that the report adds to the broad downbeat sentiment dominating the copper market.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. builders' confidence in the housing market declined this month but remained near a 10-year high, suggesting the industry is sustaining momentum despite global tumult.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>' housing-market index fell 3 points to 62 in November, the industry group said Tuesday. A reading above 50 indicates most builders are optimistic about conditions in the market for single-family homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The November report is pullback from an unusually high October, and is more in line with the consistent, modest growth that we have seen throughout the year," NAHB Chief Economist David Crowe said. "A firming economy, continued job creation and affordable mortgage rates should keep housing on an upward trajectory as we approach 2016."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest survey showed that a measure of builder expectations for sales over the next six months fell 5 points to a still relatively high 70. A measure of current sales conditions declined 3 points to 67. The index's final component, a measure of buyer traffic, rose a point to 48.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of housing starts has more than doubled since the depths of the recession but remains roughly half of its 2006 peak.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panorama encompasses a golf course of green rolling hills and gold and orange trees, woodlands along streets with DEER XING signs, and New York Harbor shimmering more than 400 feet below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Todt Hill, Staten Island, has a rich history that includes Dutch farmers, titans of business and notorious mobsters. They came for the natural beauty, the seclusion and the proximity to Manhattan. And so do today's home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Except for houses being larger and fancier, nothing has really changed in decades in Todt Hill. There are still few sidewalks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a little slice of the country," said Sally Malfi, vice president of the Todt Hill Civic Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is a new stop signal on Todt Hill Road and Ocean Terrace that residents have wanted for decades to ease the traffic that builds at the intersection. The bucolic, winding Todt Hill Road, which links the Staten Island Expressway to Richmond Road, is the western boundary of the neighborhood, running along the La Tourette Golf Course and up to views of the ocean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Swaths of the 3,000-acre Staten Island Greenbelt of forests and wetlands run along each side of the hill. Houses of every conceivable style -- colonials, columned neoclassic, stucco villas, ranch-style homes, brick mansions, enlarged Tudors -- fill the area. They sit on large lots, some measuring as much as 35,000 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People have modified some of the Tudors," said Ms. Malfi. "A lot of them can't accommodate large families. Unfortunately, it takes away the character when they make them into large center-hall colonials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Each block has its own uniqueness," she added. "This is not a cookie-cutter neighborhood."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices range from about $1 million to as high as $4 million. The average listing price as of Oct. 28 was $1.435 million, according to real estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>. The median home value was $1.038 million, up about 5% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Annual property taxes range from $10,000 to $23,000, according to Sandy Krueger, chief executive of the Staten Island Board of Realtors. He said houses are moving more quickly, and the median sales price is up by 6% to 7% from last year on the island as a whole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People are getting a higher and higher percentage of the asking price," he said. "In Todt Hill, the inventory moves slower; it's very desirable. It is the most expensive area in Staten Island, one of the most expensive in the city."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate agents say many new home buyers are from Manhattan and Brooklyn, where similarly priced homes are smaller and don't have the rural setting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Philip Isoldi came from next-door Richmond Town, where he had lived since he was 5 years old.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I had always wanted to live in Todt Hill," he said. "It's beautiful, countrified and more prestigious than any other area of Staten Island."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It took more than two years for Mr. Isoldi and husband Michael Mortensen to find their home. They bought a French colonial in August 2012 for less than $1 million and spent 10 months renovating it. Now, they enjoy a view of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and Coney Island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stately homes abut the 125-acre Richmond County Country Club, the only private golf course and country club in New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I love the area; it has always maintained its value," said Ms. Malfi, a 25-year resident.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Todt Hill is perched on a 410-foot ridge that is the highest point along the Atlantic Seaboard south of Maine, according to the <span class="companylink">U.S. Geological Survey</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tod, pronounced "tote," is a German word for dead, and the Moravian Cemetery at the foot of the hill, founded in 1740, may explain the Todt Hill name. Revolutionary War-era settlers and shipping magnate Cornelius Vanderbilt share the picturesque burial ground with infamous Mafiosi such as slain Gambino family chieftain Paul Castellano.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sprawling, stately Tudor on a dead-end road at the top of the hill is strikingly familiar -- it was used as the Corleone compound in the "Godfather" movies. Real-life godfather Castellano's former home on Benedict Road is jaw-dropping opulence: a neoclassic white mansion with columns, a large fountain and ornate iron gates.

</div><div class="author">By Leigh Kamping-Carder   </div><div>400 words</div><div>6 November 2015</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M14</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2015, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mansion buyers with a budget of $1 million or less should head to Utah, Georgia or Indiana. These states offer the highest concentration of large homes in that price range, according to real-estate listings website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its analysis, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> looked at all homes listed between October 2014 and October 2015 that were larger than 6,000 square feet -- more than twice the 2,500-square-foot median size of newly built homes -- with asking prices under $1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, only 0.32% of homes larger than 6,000 square feet fell under the $1 million mark. The states with the highest concentration: Utah (1.4%), Georgia and Indiana (0.9%), and Maryland (0.8%). States with the fewest such mansions are Arizona, Nevada, Hawaii and California, with a mere 0.1%, the data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The variation is largely the result of construction and land costs, experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The cost just to build the home in many parts of the country would take up about half of that million dollars," says Ralph McLaughlin, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>'s housing economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Utah and Georgia, building a high-end home runs about $70 per square foot, or $420,000 for a 6,000-square-foot home, he says. In California and Hawaii, the number is closer to $100 per square foot, or $600,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High energy and water costs in Arizona and Nevada and a less expensive construction-permitting process in Utah may also play a role, says Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, a trade group. (<span class="companylink">News Corp</span>, which owns The Wall Street Journal, also owns <span class="companylink">Realtor.com</span>, the listing website of <span class="companylink">NAR</span>.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phil Luizzo, founder of a pre-employment screening firm, recently listed his 5.5-acre estate in a rural part of New Smyrna Beach, Fla., for $850,000. The home has about 17,000 square feet of covered space, including a pool with a swim-up bar, a guest cabin, two barns and a go-kart track. If it were on the beach, it could fetch $3 million, says listing agent Jodie Stratton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't want negotiations. I just want to sell my home," says Mr. Luizzo.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cameron Diaz Lists Manhattan Apartment for $4.25 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actress Cameron Diaz is listing a colorful Manhattan apartment for $4.25 million, according to listing agent Rebecca Edwardson of Warburg Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The roughly 1,400-square-foot Greenwich Village condo has two bedrooms, two bathrooms and a wood-burning fireplace, said Ms. Edwardson, who said Ms. Diaz used the home as her Manhattan residence. Ms. Diaz paid $2.95 million for the prewar 12th Street home in 2008, according to public records. She gut-renovated it, enlisting interior designer Kelly Wearstler, Ms. Edwardson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Known for using vibrant colors and furniture from various time periods, Ms. Wearstler decorated the home with vintage light fixtures and rose-colored mirrors. "The apartment faces south so it gets a lot of bright light, and the mirrors accentuate that," Ms. Edwardson said. There's an emerald-green kitchen with brass countertops; the guest bathroom is black marble and pink onyx, and the living room has custom rose-colored wallpaper. All of the wall coverings were custom-made for Ms. Diaz. The furniture isn't included, but Ms. Diaz would be willing to sell it if a buyer was interested, Ms. Edwardson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The "Annie" star, 43, recently married rocker Benji Madden. In late 2013 she paid $9.52 million for a three-bedroom unit in the Chelsea condo conversion Walker Tower, according to public records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Diaz declined to comment through a representative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hamptons Home Sells for a Discounted $27 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a cooler Hamptons market, a century-old Water Mill home has sold for $27 million -- 30% less than its original asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The estate of the late hedge-fund pioneer Jack Nash originally went on the market in June of 2014 for $38.5 million and saw several price cuts. The roughly 6-acre property was last listed at $28 million, and the sale closed in late October, said co-listing agents Harald Grant of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span> and Tim Davis of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>. They declined to identify the buyer, but said there were multiple bidders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Built in the early 1900s, the house had been in the Nash family for more than 30 years. With roughly 500 feet of frontage on Mecox Bay, the property has a six-bedroom house with staff quarters and a guesthouse. The grounds include a water tower, swimming pool, a tennis court and a dock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property was challenging to price because it needed updating, Mr. Davis said. "It had a lot of charm, but with the charm comes additional work," Mr. Grant added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales in the Hamptons have slowed. According to a quarterly market report from <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</span> there were 507 closed sales in the third quarter, down 20% from 634 in the same period last year. At the high-end, the average sales price of a home in the top 10% of the Hamptons market fell 15.1% to $7.14 million in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Davis attributed the decline to a shortage of trophy properties after several busy years. Mr. Grant said many European and South American buyers are staying away due to currency issues, a factor that could be affecting demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nash was chairman of the investment firm <span class="companylink">Oppenheimer &amp; Co</span>. before co-founding the hedge fund and private-equity firm Odyssey Partners in 1982. He died in 2008. The property was sold by his wife, Helen, the author of several kosher cookbooks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'Scarface' Montecito Estate Closes for $12.26 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"El Fureidis," the elaborate California estate where scenes of the movie "Scarface" were filmed, has sold for $12.26 million -- a fraction of its original asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The roughly 10-acre Montecito property went on the market in May of 2014 for $35 million, then had its price cut to $17.9 million. It was listed by Riskin Partners and Emily Kellenberger of Village Properties Realtors. It went into contract in September and closed in late October, according to Robert Riskin, one of the listing agents. Mr. Riskin said the property was initially "overpriced," and that the sales price "reflects its value."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seller was Russia-born financier Sergey Grishin, who purchased the home in 2008 for around $20 million. He declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four-bedroom house is nearly 10,000 square feet. Designed in the early 1900s by architect Bertram Goodhue, it incorporates both Roman and Middle Eastern influences, such as a Byzantine-style "conversation room" with an 18-foot-high ceiling. In the dining room there is a barrel dome ceiling painted in 24-karat gold leaf. The grounds include Persian-style gardens and fountains. In the rear -- where the wedding scene in "Scarface" was filmed -- there are multiple patio levels and reflecting pools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyer was Houston businessman Pradeep Yohanne Gupta, CEO of private investment bank IQ Holdings. Mr. Gupta, 59, said he has another home in Montecito, but was drawn to El Fureidis because of its history and architecture; its association with "Scarface" was merely "a data point," he said. "I think we got it at a fair value," he added. Mr. Gupta added that he plans to use the home as his West Coast residence and is hoping to spend Christmas there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime Cut: East Hampton Oceanfront</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Estate Gets a Buyer for $57.3 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An oceanfront home in East Hampton has sold for $57.3 million in one of the priciest Hamptons sales of 2015, according to Andrew Saunders of Saunders &amp; Associates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Saunders said his firm was the only brokerage involved in the off-market deal, which closed in late October. He said the 4-acre site on Further Lane has an older home on it, but said he couldn't identify either the buyer or the seller due to a confidentiality agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home, on Two Mile Hollow Beach, has a tennis court and pool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to public records, the seller was the family of the late Alan and Doris Freedman. Mr. Freedman was president and chairman of New Jersey-based Ketcham &amp; McDougall, a manufacturer of marine instruments and desk accessories. The Freedman family declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the real-estate market has slowed, oceanfront land is still highly sought after in the Hamptons, and Further Lane is one of the area's priciest locations. This property is next door to the estate of investor Ron Baron, who set a record in 2007 when he paid $103 million for 40 oceanfront acres on Further Lane. Last year, a roughly 17-acre home on Further Lane sold for $147 million, setting a record not just for the Hamptons but for the country.</p>
