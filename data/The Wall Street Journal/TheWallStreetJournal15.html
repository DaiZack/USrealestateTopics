</div><div class="author">By Jonathan House </div><div>573 words</div><div>29 September 2014</div><div>08:40</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—The number of contracts signed to buy previously owned homes fell in August, a new sign of an uneven housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An index of pending sales of existing homes, reflecting purchases under contract but not yet closed, fell 1% to 104.7 in August from July, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Monday. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had forecast the index would be unchanged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pending-sales index had been trending higher in recent months and remained well above the 100 level the trade group defines as an average level of activity. But it was 2.2% below its August 2013 level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest reading pointed to the sector's headwinds as stretched affordability and fewer investor purchases pinch sales. "Further gains will be slow," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales tallied for the pending-sales index typically close a month or two later. The National Association of Realtors' closely watched barometer of existing-home sales, which measures sales after contracts close, fell in August for the first time in five months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline partly reflected fewer purchases of distressed properties by investors, whose share of overall sales fell from 16% in July to 12%, the lowest level since late 2009. Investors are girding for higher interest rates as the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> starts to rein its extraordinarily loose monetary policy of recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday's pending-sales report signaled the August softening in existing-home sales could extend into the coming months. Sales of existing homes account for around 90% of all transactions in the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes, however, surged in August to their highest level since May 2008, according to data from the Commerce Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing-market data have generally indicated a strengthening recovery in recent months. The recovery began in 2011, but was derailed in late 2013 and early 2014 by rising interest rates and an unusually harsh winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steady job growth, slowing price gains and an increased supply of homes for sale have helped to support the strengthening recovery. Employers added jobs at a monthly clip of 200,000 or more between February and July, the strongest six-month stretch of job creation since 1997.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, the National Association of Realtors' chief economist, said a rise in the number of first-time home buyers should gradually pick up the slack from investors exiting the market. "The employment outlook for young adults is brightening," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trade group believes home sales will strengthen in the months ahead, though it forecasts 2014 sales of 4.94 million existing homes will be 3% lower than last year's level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sector continues to grapple with tight bank-lending standards and worsening affordability caused by rising prices and higher mortgage rates. Though rates have been easing in recent months, many economists expect them to start rising again later this year as the Fed winds down its stimulative bond-buying program and moves closer to raising short-term interest rates. After their meeting last week, Fed officials said they would end their bond-buying program in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the week ended last Thursday, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 4.2%, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. That was down from 4.23% a week earlier but still higher than the sub-4% levels of early 2013.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Houston Chateau Asks $43 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Houston, a chateau-style home of more than 27,000 square feet will list for $43 million, making it the priciest home ever to list in the city, according to Martha Turner of Martha Turner Sotheby's International Realty, the firm listing the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Known as "Chateau Carnarvon," the limestone-and-marble house is the residence of Marie and Wilbur "Ed" Bosarge Jr., who is one of the principal beneficiaries of a family trust that owns the estate through an LLC. Mr. Bosarge, 75, is a former math faculty member at <span class="companylink">Rice University</span> and a co-founder of the Houston-based high-frequency trading firm Quantlab Financial. A well-known arts patron in Houston, he often wears a beret.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bosarges declined to comment. Ms. Turner said the owners are selling because "they have homes all over the world," and "are not using this Houston house as much as they thought they would."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a roughly 2 1/2-acre parcel in the Memorial area of Houston, the house has eight bedrooms. The trust purchased the partially completed home in 2010, and it took two years to complete. With museum-quality lighting, it was built with the intention of displaying art, she said. A circular reception hall has a 33-foot-tall domed ceiling hand-painted with trompe l'oeil lattices, and floors inlaid with marble and precious stones. A roughly 42-by-25-foot Versailles Room is intended to recreate the look of the French palace, with hand-painted floral appliques featuring 18th-century musical instruments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the dining room, wooden panels framed with gold were imported from Europe, along with painted canvases displayed on the 14-foot-tall ceiling. There is also a wood-paneled library, a home theater, a music room with a grand piano and a billiards room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The master suite has a massage room, Ms. Turner said, and the bedroom, with carved floral medallions, has sitting and dining areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house has two apartments, each of which has its own kitchen. One of them is used for guests, and the owners have turned the other one into a beauty salon, Ms. Turner said, which they use for doing hair and makeup before events.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside, a long fountain lined by trees leads up to the house, which is fronted with carved marble columns. In back, a covered dining area gives way to multitiered marble terraces surrounding a pool, cabana and spa, all flanked by gardens. In addition to four kitchens inside, there is also an outdoor kitchen, Ms. Turner said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Turner said the house is the most expensive home ever to go on the market in Houston, topping a home she listed in River Oaks in 2000 for $26 million, which sold for an undisclosed price. But thanks to the booming economy in the area, "Houston is turning a corner for expensive houses," she said. The firm's Kellie Geitner is the listing agent.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California House Once Owned by Bing Crosby</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Relists for $5 Million, a 43% Price Increase</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After being on and off the market for the past few years, the former home of late singer Bing Crosby will relist for $5 million -- a 43% jump over its prior asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Rancho Mirage, Calif., house was last on the market several years ago for $3.495 million. The house was built by Mr. Crosby in the 1950s, according to owner Robert Teller, founder of a chain of ice-cream stores. The roughly 7,000-square-foot house, which sits on a nearly 1 1/2-acre lot in the gated Thunderbird Heights community, has five bedrooms and six bathrooms, with a pool, spa and home theater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marc Lange, of HOM Sotheby's International Realty, who is listing the property with Carl Blea of the same agency, said the higher price is warranted by improvements in the local real-estate market in the past two years. Mr. Lange also pointed to a wave of interest in the area stoked by recent rumors that President Barack Obama had bought a home in Rancho Mirage, although the rumors turned out to be inaccurate. The area is now seeing more home sales in the $2 million to $5 million range, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The one-story house, with retractable glass walls, has both mountain and Coachella Valley views. The master bedroom has a private patio and the guest wing has a separate entrance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Crosby had a number of homes in the Palm Springs area over the years, including another one in Palm Desert where President John F. Kennedy famously visited, according to Robert Bader of Bing Crosby Enterprises. He said the Thunderbird Heights house has had a number of owners since Mr. Crosby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Teller, who bought the house in 2005 for $2.625 million, said it has been extensively renovated. When he bought the house, Mr. Teller renovated the master bathroom and refurnished the house, which is decorated with a number of Bing Crosby photos and movie posters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I grew up kind of in awe of Bing Crosby," said Mr. Teller, who said his childhood home was about two blocks from the singer's house in Los Angeles. Years later, when a real-estate agent told him one of Mr. Crosby's former homes near Palm Springs was on the market, he was eager to take a look. "When she told me it was Bing Crosby's house, she had me hooked," he recalled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Teller, whose primary home is in Orange County, purchased the house as vacation home. His wife, Rita, died of cancer about a year after he bought it, and since then, he hasn't spent much time there. He has rented it out for around 50 days a year at rates starting at about $3,000 a day.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Golfer Lee Trevino's Dallas Estate Goes on the Market for $13 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Golf legend Lee Trevino and his wife, Claudia, are listing their roughly 5-acre estate in Dallas for $13 million, two putting greens included.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple bought the more than 10,000-square-foot, French-style estate in 1996 for $3.5 million, according to public records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Located in Dallas's affluent Old Preston Hollow neighborhood, the home was built in the early 1950s and was thoroughly renovated in 1997-98, Mrs. Trevino said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm from Connecticut, so I wanted a casual home atmosphere," she said about their gut renovation project, which brought more of a French country aesthetic to the interior.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple moved to Dallas, Mr. Trevino's hometown, to raise their two children, who are now in their 20s. They are selling because they would like to move to a smaller home and travel more, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trevino, 74, is a six-time major champion with two U.S. Open Championships.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home includes two putting greens: one with TifEagle, a Bermuda grass specially grown for putting, and another with synthetic turf and nearby sand bunkers, Mrs. Trevino said. A stream runs through the property, which also includes a guesthouse, pool and cabana.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home was listed earlier this year for $14 million with another brokerage when the listing expired in June. Penny Tower Cook of <span class="companylink">Briggs Freeman Sotheby's International Realty</span> has the listing.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Josh Mitchell and Kris Hudson   </div><div>687 words</div><div>25 September 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of newly built homes soared last month to the highest level since 2008, a sign of stronger consumer demand that -- if sustained -- could lead to a ramp-up in construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales climbed 18% in August from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 504,000, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. That marked the biggest one-month jump since 1992 and the highest level of sales since May 2008, when the U.S. was in recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales represent a small slice of the housing market -- roughly a tenth of all sales -- and the data are volatile and often revised. But the report follows an industry survey that showed home-builder optimism this month reached the highest level since 2005. Together the reports suggest home construction could be on the verge of a long-awaited pickup, which would create jobs and stoke the broader economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The leap in August sales would bode very well for starts if it is sustained," Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist of MFR Inc., said in a note to clients. "We definitely would like to see more data on the new home market before concluding that we are ratcheting up to a new level of activity."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Broader trends suggest new-home purchases have picked up but are still running below historical averages. August's new-home sales were up 33% from a year earlier. But before the last recession, new-home sales typically reached 1 million a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The August results may have been elevated due to several special factors. Last month included more weekend days -- prime buying periods -- than July 2014 and August 2013. In addition, home sales fell off in the second half of last year as interest rates began to rise, meaning the year-earlier figures to which the latest results are compared are relatively low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many housing analysts expect new-home sales for this year to end up showing a single-digit percentage gain from 2013 total of about 429,000. To wit, Commerce data show that sales so far this year are running at a pace 2% greater than the comparable period last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Johnston, chief operating officer of Mattamy Homes Ltd., a closely held Canadian builder that operates in five U.S. states, described the new-home market as choppy in recent weeks. Mattamy's August sales in the U.S. "picked up smartly" from year-earlier figures, but that momentum fizzled in the past two weeks, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Johnston predicted "more of the same" for the balance of this year. "The numbers tell me that we should see a slow trajectory of improved or increasing sales," he said. Mattamy, based in Toronto, expects to sell 1,500 homes in the U.S. this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce report comes days after the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said sales of previously owned homes -- roughly 90% of the market -- slipped in August, ending four months of gains. The Realtors report is considered a more reliable barometer of the overall housing market because it reflects the majority of sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market faces a key test in coming months as the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> concludes its bond-buying program in October. The program is credited with helping to keep mortgage rates near historic lows. A rise in rates could dent affordability and further discourage Americans who might buy a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's report showed the number of homes on the market fell sharply, a development that could bode well for the economy. If demand continues to rise, builders would need to ramp up construction, which creates jobs, helps suppliers and pumps up the overall economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At August's sales pace, it would take 4.8 months to deplete the supply of new homes. That was down from 5.6 months of supply in July and marked the lowest level since June 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regionally, sales rose in every region except the Midwest, where sales were flat.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. stocks rose Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rebounding after two sessions of losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Dow</span> industrials gained 60 points, or 0.4%, to 17116 at midday. The S&amp;P 500 index added six points, or 0.3%, to 1989, and the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> Composite rose 23 points, or 0.5%, to 4532.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks of small companies also recovered. The <span class="companylink">Russell 2000</span> rose 0.5% to 1124, following a 0.9% decline on Tuesday. The index lost 3.5% in the three sessions ended Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes jumped 18% in August from a month earlier to an annual rate of 504,000, marking the highest level of sales since May 2008. Economists had expected an increase of 3.4% to 426,000, according to a survey by The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, recent data has raised doubts about the strength of the housing market. On Monday, data showed sales of previously owned homes fell 1.8% in August from July, ending four months of gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Citizens Financial Group</span> shares rose 1.5%. The initial public offering priced Tuesday at $21.50 a share, below the company's expected range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Bed Bath &amp; Beyond</span> gained 6.4% after the home-goods retailer reported a second-quarter profit that beat expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European stocks jumped after German business confidence hit its lowest level in more than a year, offering markets a reason to believe the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> may take more aggressive steps to invigorate the sluggish eurozone economy.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks cruised higher throughout the day. Traders noted better-than-expected housing data, but said no news in particular was responsible for the market’s broad gains. “We didn’t see a lot of individual names getting bought,” said Viren Chandrasoma, managing director of equity trading at <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>. “We just saw the market rip [higher],” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the year, the <span class="companylink">Dow</span> is up 3.8% and the S&amp;P 500 up 8.1%. Stock-market gains in the years since the financial crisis have been chalked up to the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>’s easy-money policies, which make other assets appear less attractive. The Fed is now on track to begin tightening its policy, with many investors expecting an increase in interest rates some time next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Interest rates moving higher don’t concern me because it will be the result of an improving economy,” said Dan Veru, chief investment officer at Palisade Capital Management, which manages $5 billion. “I’m confident that the stock market will bear that, because the trade-off will be higher earnings.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Health care stocks gained the most among S&amp;P 500 sectors, notching a 1.7% gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Utilities stocks fell 0.3%, the only S&amp;P sector to post a decline. Energy stocks trailed gains in the broader market, with the sector up less than 0.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Chalupnik, head of equities for <span class="companylink">Nuveen Asset Management</span>, said he is watching the beat-up energy sector for buying opportunities. “We are looking for one more down leg in the price of crude” before buying energy stocks, he said, adding that <span class="companylink">Anadarko Petroleum Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Pioneer Natural Resources</span> appeared attractively valued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In commodity markets, crude-oil futures rose 1.4% to $92.80 a barrel. Gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,218.60 an ounce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors also considered positive U.S. economic news.

Last month included more weekend days—prime buying periods—than July 2014 and August 2013. In addition, home sales fell off in the second half of last year as interest rates began to rise, meaning the year-earlier figures to which the latest results are compared are relatively low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many housing analysts expect new-home sales for this year to end up showing a single-digit percentage gain from 2013 total of about 429,000. To wit, Commerce data show that sales so far this year are running at a pace 2% greater than the comparable period last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Johnston, chief operating officer of Mattamy Homes Ltd., a closely held Canadian builder that operates in five U.S. states, described the new-home market as choppy in recent weeks. Mattamy's August sales in the U.S. "picked up smartly" from year-earlier figures, but that momentum fizzled in the past two weeks, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Johnston predicted "more of the same" for the balance of this year. "The numbers tell me that we should see a slow trajectory of improved or increasing sales," he said. Mattamy, based in Toronto, expects to sell 1,500 homes in the U.S. this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce report comes days after the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said sales of previously owned homes—roughly 90% of the market—slipped in August, ending four months of gains. The Realtors report is considered a more reliable barometer of the overall housing market because it reflects the majority of sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market faces a key test in coming months as the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> concludes its bond-buying program in October. The program is credited with helping to keep mortgage rates near historic lows. A rise in rates could dent affordability and further discourage Americans who might buy a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's report showed the number of homes on the market fell sharply, a development that could bode well for the economy. If demand continues to rise, builders would need to ramp up construction, which creates jobs, helps suppliers and pumps up the overall economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At August's sales pace, it would take 4.8 months to deplete the supply of new homes. That was down from 5.6 months of supply in July and marked the lowest level since June 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regionally, sales rose in every region except the Midwest, where sales were flat.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Josh Barbanel   </div><div>614 words</div><div>24 September 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A20</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mayor Bill de Blasio is evaluating a proposal to impose a steep property tax surcharge on expensive pied-a-terre residences owned by buyers from across the country and around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax of up to 4% a year would apply to all apartments and homes with a current market value of more than $5 million, and would exempt the primary residences of New Yorkers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked about the proposal at a news conference Tuesday, Mr. de Blasio said: "We'll certainly take a look at it. It's a new proposal, so we'll assess it, and then once we have a better sense of it, we'll have more to say."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mayor's statement prompted warnings by the real-estate industry that a heavy new tax could jeopardize demand for hundreds of expensive new luxury condos under development, especially in Midtown Manhattan, and damage the city's standing around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This certainly does not help the reputation or future of our great city," said Pamela Liebman, president of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, a Manhattan brokerage. "It seems blatantly unfair to treat our global citizens like this."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, which represents the real-estate industry, said: "It's probably a good way to start the collapse of the residential market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposal was made by the Fiscal Policy Institute, a research and education group that gets a quarter of its funding from public employee unions. Five of 11 board members are from such unions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Parrott, the institute's deputy director and chief economist, said that nonresident owners don't pay city income taxes and often pay low property taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These owners bid up the price of New York City residential real estate, and since they don't spend much time in these units, contribute little to the local economy compared to full-time residents," the report noted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">State Sen. Brad Hoylman, a Manhattan Democrat, said he has been circulating a draft of a new tax surcharge bill to union and business leaders, and plans to introduce it in Albany in time for the new legislative session in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People who have a primary residence in the city would still have to pay the higher tax if they own a second home valued at more than $5 million. An aide to Mr. Hoylman said it would be unconstitutional to make only out-of-state residents the target of the tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver declined to comment, saying "we haven't seen any proposal."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposal would impose the tax surcharge for homes valued at more than $5 million with a 0.5% surcharge, which would rise gradually to 4% for home values above $25 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though New York must follow complex rules in making regular property assessments, which keep many tax bills low, the legislation would base the surcharge on an estimate of the current value of each apartment based on comparable sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A six-bedroom penthouse in contract for $95 million at 432 Park Ave., a skyscraper under construction near 57th Street, would face a surcharge of $3.1 million each year on top of about $260,000 in regular property taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary Barnett, president of Extell Development Co., the developer of two other towers on West 57th Street, said the taxes could put an end to such buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is no way in the world that any luxury buildings like these are going to get built again," he said. "There is the problem of killing the golden goose."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home sales slumped in August as investors continued to pull away, raising doubts about the market's underlying strength.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes fell 1.8% from July to an annual rate of 5.05 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said. That ended four months of gains and pushed sales down 5.3% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline reflected fewer purchases by investors, who helped fuel the housing-market rebound. The share of overall sales that went to investors fell to 12% last month, the lowest level since late 2009. Investors accounted for as much as 23% of sales in early 2012 as they bought up properties, many in foreclosure, at bargain prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, the NAR's chief economist, said investors may be getting skittish about the prospect of higher interest rates as the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> winds down a bond-buying program that was designed to pump up the economy. There are also fewer "distressed" properties for investors to quickly snap up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pullback means that the market will increasingly rely on demand from traditional home buyers who typically need a mortgage, including first-time buyers, Mr. Yun said. But lenders are still imposing tight credit underwriting standards, preventing many families from obtaining a home loan, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I do believe there is sizable pent-up demand -- it's just a matter of when it will get released," Mr. Yun said. He was referring to Americans who are renting because they can't buy or living with others to save.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yun estimates that sales would be roughly 15% higher if lending standards were as they were in 2000, a year he considers "normal" because it occurred before the housing bubble and collapse. Then, he said, the average credit score of someone taking out a loan backed by the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span> was 660; today it is roughly 700.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Potential buyers face other obstacles -- including stagnant incomes and prices that hurt affordability -- that could mean choppy progress through the year. Also, a rise in interest rates will be a test for the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We think home sales are running out of steam now that the post-winter rebound is over and the buyers for distressed properties fade away," Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But first-time buyers could find it easier to purchase homes in coming months as competition from investors -- who can push up prices with all-cash offers -- falls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales rose sharply in 2012 and the first half of 2013 before losing momentum due to a run-up in interest rates and prices. But the sector regained traction this year, thanks to a retreat in interest rates and robust job growth. Mortgage rates have hovered just above 4%, a historically low level, for much of the summer before clicking up to 4.23% last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But interest rates are expected to rise as the <span class="companylink">Fed</span> winds down its bond-buying program next month and moves closer to raising short-term interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday's report suggested tight inventory may be weighing on sales. The number of for-sale homes has risen 4.5% over the past year to 2.31 million in August, but the level is still low by historical standards. Economists say many prospective buyers want to see more options than the market currently offers before they sign a contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the current pace, it would take 5 1/2 months to exhaust the supply of homes for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices continue to rise, but at a more moderate pace compared with earlier in the housing recovery. The median sale price for a home last month was $219,000, up 4.8% from a year earlier.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China Property's Shared Pain</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are many risks surrounding Chinese property stocks. Add another: share issuance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mainland developer Agile Property announced a share-rights issue Monday to raise money to pay down debt. It is the third Chinese developer to launch a rights issue in recent weeks, following Country Garden and <span class="companylink">Yuexiu Property</span>, according to Dealogic. With debt-to-equity ratios swelling and property prices sliding, more could be coming down the pike.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agile, a midsize developer, has been a favorite of short sellers. It suffers exposure to China's smaller, weaker property markets and has slashed prices to move inventory, but sales remain weak compared with peers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rights issue, which would raise $360 million, is a step toward repairing Agile's fragile balance sheet. The debt-to-equity ratio -- including hybrid securities -- would drop from 106% to 93%, according to <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span>. That Agile's management felt the need to raise equity with shares trading well below book value indicates the urgency of the situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This being Chinese property, there is debt lurking even in the equity raising. The controlling Chen family, with 63% of the company, will fund its portion of the rights issue with a loan from the sponsors of the overall transaction, <span class="companylink">HSBC</span>, <span class="companylink">Standard Chartered</span> and <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span>. The family's shares serve as collateral on the loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agile's stock was already off 30% this year before the rights offering was announced, and fell another 7% Monday. Of course, what is bad for stock investors is better news for bonds, with the fresh cash decreasing the likelihood of default. Agile's dollar bonds rallied on the news.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bond investors now must guess which developer is next to raise equity. The trouble is they may simply raise more debt. While it has become difficult to source loans on the mainland, bond markets offshore remain open. <span class="companylink">Oceanwide Holdings</span> and <span class="companylink">Powerlong Real Estate</span> have both issued bonds this month, with interest rates above 10%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the surface, an obvious candidate for fresh equity would be <span class="companylink">Evergrande Real Estate</span>, one of the larger players. It has exposure to China's quickly tightening trust-loan industry and an already high debt-to-equity ratio of 248% including perpetual securities counted as debt, according to <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>. A $1.35 billion bond matures in January. Its recent foray into the edible-oils business has done little to reassure investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Evergrande presents a hard-to-read case. It used borrowings to buy back its own beleaguered shares earlier this year. To turn around and issue new ones would be an about-face -- one that the company's bondholders should hope it considers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Network Fees Create New</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TV Broadcasting Drama</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Broadcasters have had a cushy seat on the couch in recent years. Their future looks a bit less comfortable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Networks including <span class="companylink">CBS</span>, <span class="companylink">21st Century Fox</span>, <span class="companylink">Comcast</span>'s NBCUniversal and <span class="companylink">Walt Disney</span>'s <span class="companylink">ABC</span> have been relying for some time on fees they charge cable and satellite operators for the right to carry their signals. Known as retransmission fees, these have high margins and have been an important source of profit growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But amid continuing weakness in advertising, the networks have been increasingly turning to a different party with their hands out: owners of local broadcast stations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the networks see it, the broadcasters, which also receive retransmission fees from pay-TV providers, are reaping the benefit of their content, especially for sports programming like the <span class="companylink">National Football League</span>. Local stations produce their own newscasts, but most contribute little else in the way of programming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, some station owners enjoy operating margins of as much as 40% versus about 25% for <span class="companylink">CBS</span>, a gap that likely rankles networks. "It's not like these stations are starving to death," <span class="companylink">CBS</span> chief Les Moonves said at a Sept. 10 media and telecom conference hosted by <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, those fatter margins may be magnifying the target on broadcasters' backs as networks step up efforts to wring more money from their content.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leading that charge is <span class="companylink">CBS</span>, which has pledged to bring revenue from retransmission fees and reverse retransmission fees, as the payments from broadcast stations are known, to $1 billion by 2017 and $2 billion by 2020. That compares with $612 million in 2014, Janney Capital Markets estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evidence of the additional pressure is beginning to bubble up. On Aug. 11, <span class="companylink">CBS</span> and Tribune Media announced a renewal of their existing agreement and then added a twist: Tribune would be taking over the <span class="companylink">CBS</span> affiliation in Indianapolis from LIN Media after the latter apparently balked at <span class="companylink">CBS</span>'s demands. For station owners, protecting margins amid these rising fees means negotiating higher retransmission fees from pay-TV providers. But that could be increasingly difficult to do as pay-TV providers, including <span class="companylink">Comcast</span>, <span class="companylink">Time Warner Cable</span>, <span class="companylink">AT&amp;T</span> and <span class="companylink">DirecTV</span>, combine to gain heft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an Aug. 25 filing with the <span class="companylink">Federal Communications Commission</span> regarding the Comcast-Time Warner Cable tie-up, <span class="companylink">Sinclair Broadcast Group</span> said it was "in the unusual (and tenuous) position" of both licensing <span class="companylink">Comcast</span>'s programming via <span class="companylink">NBC</span> and supplying that programming to <span class="companylink">Comcast</span>'s cable systems. Such pressures could "doom" broadcasters in some local markets, Sinclair wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seemingly obvious answer is for broadcasters to get bigger, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This rationale has spurred a spate of deals, including <span class="companylink">Media General</span>'s pending acquisition of LIN and its 2013 buy of <span class="companylink">Young Broadcasting</span>, <span class="companylink">E.W. Scripps</span>'s proposed merger with <span class="companylink">Journal Communications</span>, Gannett's purchase of Belo and a number of deals by Sinclair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is a limit to that, because the <span class="companylink">FCC</span> has capped the number of stations a broadcaster can own at 39% of national TV households. It is also likely to end the ability of companies to have stations broadcasting via ultrahigh-frequency signals count for less toward the cap, grandfathering in those that will be pushed over the cap by the change. Assuming that happens, Tribune is already at 44% penetration, Sinclair at 39%, Gannett at 31% and <span class="companylink">Media General</span>/LIN at 24%, according to <span class="companylink">Moody's</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An increase in the cap is unlikely, at least under the Obama administration, because the <span class="companylink">FCC</span> views media deregulation as harmful to the diversity of voices, according to Paul Gallant, an analyst with <span class="companylink">Guggenheim Partners</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Broadcasters will have a stronger case to make to regulators down the road if pressure from networks and distributors leads to lower margins, particularly if the <span class="companylink">FCC</span> approves the two pay-TV deals in front of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until then, there may be leaner times ahead for broadcasters.</p>

The number of for-sale homes has risen 4.5% over the past year to 2.31 million in August, but the level is still low by historical standards. Economists say many prospective buyers want to see more options than the market currently offers before they sign a contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the current pace, it would take 51/2 months to exhaust the supply of homes for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices continue to rise, but at a more moderate pace compared with earlier in the housing recovery. The median sale price for a home last month was $219,000, up 4.8% from a year earlier.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kris Hudson   </div><div>731 words</div><div>22 September 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Momentum seems to favor <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> and the broader home-building market as both prepare to post quarterly results this week. The gains might not be as strong as they appear, however, for several reasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Various analysts estimate that <span class="companylink">KB Home</span>, a Los Angeles-based builder that operates in 10 states, will post a gain of 5% to 15% in sales contracts for its quarter ended Aug. 31 compared with a year earlier, when it reports its results on Wednesday. They foresee a gain for <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> after larger rival <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>. last week posted a heady 23% increase in orders for the same quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the same day, the Commerce Department is slated to release figures for August new-home sales. Analysts expect that last month's sales amounted to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of roughly 430,000, up about 4% from the July tally before revisions. August typically is the sixth busiest month of the year for new-home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While both readings are expected to show strong gains, that doesn't necessarily mean the new-home market has suddenly shifted into a higher gear. Rather, the market's underlying theme is one of slow progress that either matches last year's pace or only slightly exceeds it. To wit, Commerce data released this past Thursday showed that construction starts for single-family homes so far this year have exceeded last year's pace at this point by only 3.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For new-home sales to ramp up significantly, builders need to start constructing a greater volume of affordable homes to cater to first-time and entry-level buyers. That is slowly starting to happen, but many economists and builders don't expect such a shift to gain substantial momentum until next year at the earliest. Entry-level buyers' recovery from the downturn, in terms of job growth, wage growth and access to credit, has been a slow one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I suspect that, in the balance of this year, at best we're going to see some treading water" for new-home sales, said Stan Humphries, chief economist at real-estate data provider <span class="companylink">Zillow Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So why will August sales likely appear stronger than they really are? First, there is a calendar advantage. There were more weekend days last month (10) than in July (eight) and August 2013 (nine). Weekends are prime home-buying periods. That means last month essentially stole sales from this month, which has eight weekend days in contrast to nine last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remember also that 2013 essentially was a tale of two markets. Home sales were strong in the first half of the year, but they slowed down markedly in the second half as interest rates rose one-percentage point. That means the year-ago figures to which current results now are being compared represent a relatively low hurdle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, many builders are posting gains in their sales-contract tallies more because they are opening new residential developments, rather than selling many more homes in their existing communities. It is similar to a retailer that boosts its overall sales by opening more stores rather than by generating more sales from its existing stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider that <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> operated 18% more developments last quarter than it did a year earlier. <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co</span>. analyst Michael Rehaut calculates that <span class="companylink">Lennar</span>'s sales on a per-community basis, similar to same-store sales for retailers, grew at a tamer 4% clip in that span.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">David Weekley Homes</span>, a closely held builder that operates in 10 states, reports that its sales contracts in August exceeded the year-ago tally by nearly 25% in total. But, on a per-community basis, Weekley's gain was in the range of 10% to 15%, Chief Executive John Johnson said. Thus, Weekley's growth in August was strong, but not necessarily gangbusters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, after a relatively sluggish spring and early summer, Weekley, <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> and other builders will embrace decent gains. "June and July were slower for us, but August rebounded rather strongly," Mr. Johnson said. "The traffic didn't pick up more; people just decided to buy [rather than browse]. And September has been pretty steady so far."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Gregory Zuckerman </div><div>1476 words</div><div>21 September 2014</div><div>12:56</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is it too late to catch the real-estate rebound?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just a few years after suffering its worst downturn since the Great Depression, housing has seen a remarkable recovery. Skimpy interest rates, pent-up demand and lower prices have sparked gains of about 20% in the median price of new and existing homes over the past two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones U.S. Select REIT Index—which covers a number of investment vehicles—has climbed about 150% since the beginning of 2009, roughly matching the Standard &amp; Poor's 500, including dividends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the market's foundation is starting to wobble. In June, home prices fell 0.2% compared with May's levels, according to the seasonally adjusted S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index tracking the 20 largest cities. It marked the second consecutive monthly decline. The dip the month before marked the first time in about three years that prices fell on a monthly basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">True, prices for June rose 8.1% compared with last year, and data tracking the sentiment of home builders has improved. But every city in the U.S. has seen home prices rise at a slower annual rate lately. Mortgage applications to buy a home recently fell to their lowest levels since February, refinance applications were the weakest since 2008, and housing starts dropped in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The pace of slowing…has been somewhat more abrupt than we had expected entering the year," says Michael Gapen, a senior economist at <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>, who says there's "downside risk" to his bank's expectation that home prices will rise as much as 8% this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's going on? In part, the soaring prices of the past couple years have started scaring off first-time buyers. Those higher prices have also encouraged homeowners to put homes up for sale, adding new inventory. Meanwhile, investors, who played a key role in stabilizing the market by buying bargain properties, have become more cautious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowdown is good news for home buyers, of course. And recent weakness in real-estate investments, including home builders, has created opportunities for bargain hunters, some analysts say. But if the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> begins raising interest rates next year, as expected, the cost of financing will increase—making things tougher for buyers and investors alike.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Below is a look at the new real-estate game and the best ways to play it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITS: Beware Rising Rates</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the attractions of REITs is that they pay at least 90% of taxable income to shareholders as dividends, about 4% on average lately. But analysts say many real-estate investment trusts are trading at expensive levels. And rising rates could undercut REITs by making their dividends look less compelling compared with bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Expensive valuations don't mean avoiding REITs, analysts say—just shifting to larger, high-quality REITs with lower borrowing, such as Sam Zell's <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> and <span class="companylink">AvalonBay Communities Inc</span>., each of which pays dividends of more than 3%. Because of their size and balance sheets, these are seen as safer bets if rates rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Specific types of REITs could also be particularly hard hit by rising rates, such as those focused on health care. These facilities generally have long-term leases, making rent increases harder. A better option amid rate concerns: REITs such as <span class="companylink">Extra Space Storage Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Camden Property Trust</span> and <span class="companylink">Hersha Hospitality Trust</span>. These companies, which own apartments, self-storage facilities and lodging, likely will do better in a rising-rate environment because they can boost rents more quickly than REITs focused on other sectors, argues Matthew Werner, a portfolio manager at Chilton Capital Management LLC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If rate increases come slowly, most REITs should do fine, some argue. "REITs have demonstrated that they have performed well in environments when the Fed has gradually raised interest rates," says Kevin Mahn, chief investment officer at Hennion &amp; Walsh Asset Management. For instance, he says, in 2004-2006, when the Fed raised rates 17 times, U.S. publicly traded REITs scored annual returns of nearly 28%, including dividends, and the overall real-estate market boomed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A more diversified way to wager on REITs is with exchange-traded funds such as SPDR <span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> REIT ETF and <span class="companylink">iShares U.S. Real Estate ETF</span>. ETFs are low cost and allow investors to buy and sell throughout the day, but their diversification means an investor is unlikely to outperform the overall industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those more comfortable with risk, Adam Patti, chief executive officer of IndexIQ, recommends small-cap REITs. He notes that "smaller players are often attractive takeover targets."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But investors should be careful about REITs that don't trade on an exchange. These can have higher dividends than publicly traded REITs but can be hard to sell during downturns and have performances and values that can be difficult to understand, analysts warn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DIRECT INVESTING: More Stability, Less Liquidity</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steven Karsh, principal, director at Innovest Portfolio Solutions, a Denver-based advisory firm, offers a caveat about REITs: They rise and fall with the overall market. For better diversification, he recommends direct investing in commercial and residential properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"REITs have a higher correlation to equities, and currently are overvalued relative to their net asset value," he says, but "within direct real estate, depending where on the risk spectrum you look, values range from undervalued to slightly overvalued. Direct real estate is illiquid, but its performance is steadier."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If inflation picks up, he adds, real estate should do well, because rents rise with inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another way to invest directly is by buying into a limited-partnership fund, a private vehicle that buys stakes in properties. The partners can avoid some headaches that come with direct investing, such as paying for the upkeep of properties; the limited-partnership structure also gives protection from certain liabilities. But these funds typically are for large investors and come with big minimum investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now is also a good time to buy a home, many analysts argue. The slowing growth in prices makes homes more affordable, even as rental costs inflate for single-family homes and multifamily apartments. Meanwhile, interest rates remain slim. The average rate for conforming 30-year fixed-rate mortgages recently was 4.19%, close to the lowest levels of the year, says HSH.com, which collects mortgage data. Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH.com, says, "Price gains have cooled in many areas, and mortgage rates are lower than they were expected to be this year. The combination is a favorable one, and if it holds, it should provide a solid foundation for home sales this fall."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOUSING STOCKS: Hunting for Bargains</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost every kind of company in the housing business boomed in the years leading up to the real-estate crisis—and almost every one cratered after home prices began to fall in 2007. Lately, more investors have concluded that the future for home builders is gloomy. Their view: Americans are more comfortable renting and will keep having trouble getting credit to buy a home. "First-time potential buyers are choosing to rent instead of buy," says Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at Lindsey Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, it's been a tough period for many housing-related stocks. The <span class="companylink">S&amp;P</span> Composite 1500 Homebuilding Index, which tracks the 11 largest companies in the sector, dropped about 2.94% this year, through Sept. 18, while the S&amp;P 500 rose 8.82%. But some stock watchers say the sector is due to rebound. Ivy Zelman, founder of Zelman Associates, says the current gloom is overstated and housing prices will continue to slowly appreciate. "People still believe in the American dream," says Ms. Zelman, who was early in predicting the housing downturn and anticipated the rebound. "The housing market is lukewarm and will get warmer."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of <span class="companylink">Ryland Group</span>, down about 12% in the past year, look attractive, some analysts say. The home builder has a solid balance sheet and builds homes nationally at various prices, making it safer than some rivals. <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>. is seen as another relatively safe and attractive builder. Home-building shares are volatile, though, so investors should consider an ETF, such as SPDR S&amp;P Homebuilders ETF, which provides diversification. Home-furnishing companies are another way to play a slowly growing market. Some hedge funds recently added shares of floor-covering giant <span class="companylink">Mohawk Industries</span>, up 5% in the past year.</p>

</div><div class="author">By AnnaMaria Andriotis   </div><div>2162 words</div><div>20 September 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B7</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two-and-a-half years into the U.S. housing recovery, the real-estate industry is rolling out new ways for individuals to invest in the property market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers, property managers and others are helping buyers purchase houses in distant cities and manage them as rentals for a fee. Publicly traded trusts that collect rental income are selling shares to investors. And crowdfunding startups are matching buyers with willing lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest pitches generally aim to eliminate the day-to-day headaches of being a landlord, and the potential payoff can make the concept worth considering. Investors can buy in for the price of a single-family home or a single share of stock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the plunge in U.S. home prices in the financial crisis should be a fresh reminder that bets on housing can sour in a hurry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest deals often don't depend on home values going up, which sets them apart from the house-flipping strategies that cost many home buyers dearly when the market collapsed. Yet investors could still face losses if, for example, the economy weakens and renters can't keep up with their payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who buy a rental property and then need their money back down the road could also get burned. Unlike stocks, bonds and mutual funds that can be sold quickly, it can take months to unload a house even in a strong market. And if prices decline, investors may lose a chunk of principal for good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the risks, investors worried about pricey stocks and meager bond yields can be lured by the prospect of a steady income stream and average annual returns that could range from 5% to 15%, if things go well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't go overboard. Investors should maintain a diversified portfolio that also includes stocks, bonds and cash. Single-family homes shouldn't exceed 5% of their investments, not including their primary residence, says Jeff Sica, president of Sica Wealth Management in Morristown, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the moment, the supply of rental homes and the demand from renters are high. Some 14.9 million single-family homes were occupied by renters in 2013, up 31% since 2006, before the U.S. housing market collapsed, according to data released this past week by the <span class="companylink">U.S. Census Bureau</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vacancy rate on single-family rentals fell to 7.3% in the second quarter, down from 10% in the fourth quarter of 2008, according to the bureau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's what you need to know about making money in the rental market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Traditional Route</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many investors become landlords on their own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Millions of the single-family homes occupied by renters are owned by investors who have just one such rental property, estimates Jade Rahmani, who tracks the single-family rental market as an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, an investment bank based in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are many benefits to going the traditional route. You get to choose the tenants, and you decide how much rent to charge them. You don't have to pay fees to a property manager, which can eat into your returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it also means taking on a lot of responsibility, both when buying the property and while owning it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Would-be landlords should figure out whether they are paying a good price. That means knowing the market and hiring an inspector to determine what repairs a house may need. Buyers should lower their offer to account for expensive repairs such as to the roof or boiler, says Jack McCabe, an independent housing analyst in Deerfield Beach, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors should plan to own a home for at least 10 years and realize that they may shell out significant sums before seeing a return on the investment, says Mr. Sica. Be careful about taking out big mortgages. "Low borrowing rates encourage speculation," he says. "Investors are constantly tempted to take cheap money and not be as diligent with the deals they do."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors should also research the expected annual expenses, including property taxes, insurance and maintenance, says Mr. McCabe. Allow for the fact that property taxes and insurance rarely decline, and can sometimes spike suddenly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The net gain, once taxes on rental income are factored in, should be at least 8%, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Landlords also routinely get emergency calls from tenants about urgent repairs, so it is often best to live or work in the area to get to the property quickly, if necessary. Experts say tenants tend to take better care of a home when they know the owner is nearby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Be prepared for worst-case scenarios, and study local laws. Landlords, for example, may have limited options if a tenant stops paying rent, and evictions can take months in some places.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One-Stop Shopping</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To many investors, doing all that work sounds hard. An expanding roster of real-estate firms promise to make the process easier -- for a price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Memphis Invest, a real-estate brokerage based in Memphis, buys properties -- which have often gone through foreclosure -- fixes them up, rents them out and then sells them to investors. It will also manage the property for a fee. It has been operating in the Memphis area since 2004, and it expanded to Dallas in 2010 and Houston in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HomeUnion, based in Irvine, Calif., helps clients find prospective rental properties and purchase them. The firm will then help buyers find property managers. HomeUnion launched in 2011 and operates in 15 metropolitan areas, primarily in the Southeast and Midwest, and is expanding to others by year-end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Francisco-based Dwell Real Estate Advisors also helps buyers find rental properties to purchase. Typically, the homes already have tenants. Dwell will help clients find a property manager. The firm operates in and around Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Houston and San Antonio, as well as in Northern California and South Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firms generally look for homes that have low prices, usually $60,000 to $150,000, but that have the potential to fetch relatively high rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to helping investors find a house to buy, the firms make it easier to invest far from home, including in markets where home prices may be lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Cook, who is 61 years old and lives in Hollister, Calif., says he has spent about $350,000 purchasing five rental homes in the Indianapolis and Cleveland areas through HomeUnion over the past 18 months or so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I was looking for what I consider a more stable return on investment," says Mr. Cook, a manager at a construction-materials firm. "It's not about appreciation of properties. It's really about cash flow." He says he has earned a 5.5% to 7% return on each property so far, after management fees and property taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But investors also surrender a great deal of control in such deals, particularly if they don't live nearby. They should consider visiting the property before purchasing it, or at least request extensive pictures of the home, including all the rooms, the roof and major appliances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Research the local market, too. For example, investors can check the <span class="companylink">Bureau of Labor Statistics</span> website to see whether the local unemployment rate is decreasing, which could suggest a smaller chance of renters falling behind on their payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>' website provides quarterly updates on median home-sale prices in many metro areas. Rising prices suggest that investors have a better shot at recouping their cash -- and possibly turning a profit -- if they suddenly have to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are other potential drawbacks. Memphis Invest charges a 15% to 20% premium on the homes it sells, says Chris Clothier, a partner at the firm. That could make it harder for an investor to unload the property at a profit in the near term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fees can also add up. HomeUnion, for example, charges 1% of the purchase price annually as long as the investor owns the property. It also charges 7% to 10% of monthly rent when the home is occupied. Memphis Invest charges 9% to 10% of monthly rent, depending on the number of homes it manages for an investor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors should also plan to closely track a property manager's expenses and review receipts for repairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, investors should consider what could happen if the home is vacant or the renter doesn't pay. Some of the firms guarantee rent payments for a year, but even they make no long-term promises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taking Stock</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investing in a home means placing a risky and concentrated bet. So does buying shares in a company that owns homes -- but the price tag can be much lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Firms that own portfolios of single-family rentals are for the first time offering shares to the public through real-estate investment trusts, or REITs, says Jason Lail, manager of real-estate research at <span class="companylink">SNL Financial</span>, a financial-information firm based in Charlottesville, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six REITs that are entirely or primarily focused on single-family homes have started trading publicly since the end of 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the properties were distressed homes purchased from banks at a discount, then repaired and rented out. Much of the rent the REITs collect gets passed on to investors. Shareholders must receive at least 90% of a REIT's taxable income in the form of dividends each year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Performance varies widely. For example, one such REIT, <span class="companylink">American Homes 4 Rent</span>, has logged an 8% gain this year, including dividends, through Thursday, while another, Altisource Residential, has logged a 12% loss, according to FactSet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors should consider the risks of an investment that is so new. Before buying shares, investors should review a REIT's holdings by checking the firm's website and filings with the <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs that bought single-family homes around 2009 and 2010, when home prices were near bottom, may provide greater returns, says Mr. McCabe. So may REITs that are currently buying in cities where purchase prices and other costs are relatively low, such as Dallas, Indianapolis and Nashville, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company's management can also be crucial. Returns could depend on the companies' access to capital and operating efficiency, among other factors, says Mr. Lail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crowded House</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crowdfunding -- the practice of pooling small amounts of money from many investors -- has helped budding entrepreneurs capture the imagination of strangers who combine to bankroll a dream.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, home buyers who think they have found a promising fixer-upper have gotten into the act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New online crowdfunding platforms that focus on housing, such as Groundfloor, iFunding and Patch of Land, have launched over the past year or so. These firms consider pitches from borrowers who want to repair a home, then sell it or rent it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firms then post the approved projects online, listing the property, the requested loan amount, the interest rate the borrower will pay and the amount of time it will take the borrower to repay the loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typically, investors decide how much cash they are willing to put up. Groundfloor will accept as little as $100 per lender.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Patzer, a 27-year-old software engineer who lives in Atlanta, says he began making loans through Groundfloor in March and so far has helped fund seven deals by putting up $300 to $1,600 for each. The loans must each be repaid after six months, and the interest rates range from 8% to 12%. He has already been paid back on two of the deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He chose short-term deals and focused on homes he believes are a good value in an effort to limit potential losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I certainly think of the risk in any of these projects," Mr. Patzer says. "This hasn't been done before."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kris Hudson   </div><div>936 words</div><div>19 September 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOMESTEAD, Fla. -- The exurbs are starting to make a comeback, signaling that the housing market's recovery is slowly spreading beyond major cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Areas on the outskirts of cities went bust earlier and harder than most other places during the housing downturn. That is partly because job losses, mortgage defaults and high gasoline prices hit families living there particularly hard, hampering home sales and construction in the far-flung neighborhoods. Builders, blaming weak demand in these areas, shifted to building on more expensive land closer to city centers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though definitions vary, exurbs generally are bedroom communities on the fringe of metropolitan areas, where homes account for most of the building stock, many residents make long commutes to work and agriculture or open land border the community on one or more sides.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists deemed a recovery in these areas unlikely for several years. Yet many of the locales, specifically in the South and West, are rebounding earlier than expected for one main reason: relatively inexpensive housing costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Nationwide</span>, median home prices for existing homes have risen by roughly 23% since 2009, while prices of new homes are up about 26%. In some cities, including Phoenix, Miami, Austin, Texas, and San Jose, Calif., home prices are at or near prerecession levels, leaving them out of reach for many families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, average rents have increased 10% in the past three years to $1,100 a month in the top 79 U.S. markets, the highest level since research firm <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>. began tracking rents in 1980.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast, home prices in these outskirts have remained relatively low, creating a draw for buyers weary of rising rent and home prices in city centers. For example, median resale prices in Phoenix's Maricopa County have rebounded by 82% from their nadir in 2011 to $205,000, while those in exurban Pinal County, Ariz., have risen by 65.5% in that span to a considerably cheaper median of $144,000, said the <span class="companylink">Phoenix Association of Realtors</span>. Some builders, too, are moving to the outskirts because land prices are substantially lower there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nascent revival of these areas is occurring as home construction is slowly ramping up on a broader scale. Commerce Department data released Thursday show that builders started construction of 437,100 single-family homes in the first eight months of this year, up nearly 3.1% from the same period last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National home builder <span class="companylink">Ryland Group Inc</span>. has revived some previously mothballed residential projects on the outskirts of Charlotte, N.C., in the past year. "I'm definitely seeing a trend toward these areas," said Bob Bennett, Ryland's division president in Charlotte. "People are starting to consider driving a bit further to get the home they want at a better price."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Research firm Metrostudy, part of <span class="companylink">Hanley Wood LLC</span>, examined home construction in 10 mostly exurban counties across the U.S. It found that developers in the 10 counties produced 136.1% more home lots in the past four quarters than in the previous year, handily outpacing the broader market's 46% increase in that span. Those communities also saw an 18.9% increase in home construction starts in that span, exceeding the broader market's 17.2% increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider the recovery of Homestead, Fla., a town roughly 20 miles south of Miami best known for suffering the worst damage from Hurricane Andrew in 1992. It is a classic exurb, with rows of stucco-walled homes surrounded by palm-tree farms and, to the west, the Everglades. Many residents here commute to jobs in larger cities such as Miami and Fort Lauderdale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homestead was devastated from 2008 to 2011 by rampant foreclosures, plunging home values and a near halt to new construction. But now Homestead is rebounding as construction crews are erecting new houses and a new city hall. Homestead has become a magnet in the past year for families in South Florida looking for bargain-priced housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, William and Vanessa Velez purchased a newly built, three-bedroom house here for $228,000. Even though they each commute about 45 minutes to their jobs, costing the family about $170 a week in gasoline and tolls, the low housing price far outweighs the commuting costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Velezes paid roughly $1.33 a square foot a month for the one-bedroom apartment they previously rented in Coconut Creek in northern Broward County. Now, their mortgage amounts to roughly $1.06 a square foot a month for their 1,800-square-foot house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The neighborhoods that we looked at [in Broward County] that are comparable to where we are now were probably double the price," Mr. Velez said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though prices remain relatively low in Homestead, they are starting to rise. Average prices peaked at $274,546 in 2006, according to the <span class="companylink">Miami Association of Realtors</span>, then tumbled to $88,006 in 2008. The average so far this year is $138,469, less than half of Miami's average of $282,458.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>., the largest home builder in Homestead, has seen sales here rise from a low point of 66 in 2010 to a projected 230 this year. <span class="companylink">Lennar</span>'s prices in Homestead range from $170,000 to more than $300,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People are back in a significant way buying homes," said Carlos Gonzalez, <span class="companylink">Lennar</span>'s division president for Southeast Florida. "Homes are so unaffordable everywhere else, and this is the cheap alternative. It's that simple."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anya Martin   </div><div>813 words</div><div>19 September 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hard money loans, which got an unsavory reputation during the housing crisis, are being rehabbed for buyers of high-end fixer-uppers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A hard money loan differs from a mortgage in that the loan amount is based on the anticipated sales price of the home after improvement costs. Terms are short (typically just 12 months), interest rates are much higher and the loan is backed only by the hard asset, the residential property. Borrowers of these loans avoid a stringent assessment of their credit scores, income and debt-to-income ratios.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the mortgage crisis, hard money loans were most known for their association with low-end home-flippers profiting off cheap foreclosures, cosmetic improvements and fast turnarounds, as well as some small lenders who targeted borrowers rejected by conventional lenders. Now hard money lending firms and funds are increasingly financing higher-end investors who are eyeing the recovering luxury home market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Flippers who can are moving to the high-end because distressed property values have not risen as quickly on the high-end, so margins are bigger," says Daren Blomquist, vice president at market researcher RealtyTrac. Overall house-flipping, defined as homes bought and sold within 12 months, fell year over year, but flips with a resale price of $750,000 or more rose 21% in the second quarter of 2014, according to RealtyTrac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More important, high-end flippers are averaging a 41% return on investment (ROI) for homes priced $750,000 to $1 million, and a 35% ROI for homes priced in the $1 to $2 million range, according to RealtyTrac. In comparison, flipping a home priced between $200,000 to $300,000 generated a 22% return, the data shows. Of buyers who resold homes at prices ranging from $750,000 to $5 million, 51% made their initial purchase with cash, suggesting that nearly half are using some kind of financing, Mr. Blomquist says. However, less than 2% of overall home loans are backed with hard money, according to Inside Mortgage Finance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July 2013, Atlanta-based hard money lender Lima One Capital started to see a "real uptick in large loans" for rehabs on luxury homes, says President John S. Warren, who launched Lima One in 2011 and is now lending in nine states and the District of Columbia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other hard money lenders also are seeing a boom for bigger loans. In early September, for example, Asset Based Lending closed on a $1 million loan for a townhouse rehab project in Harlem, says Daniel Leyden, co-managing partner of the Hoboken, N.J.-based firm which serves borrowers in New York, New Jersey, southern Connecticut and eastern Pennsylvania. He says the firm's fund has financed over 300 hard money loans totaling more than $40 million in the past three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without hard lending, 42-year-old Washington, D.C.-based investor Carlos Perez and his son Carlos Perez, Jr., say they could never have bought their first luxury investment property, a split-level purchased for $800,000 in the affluent Buckhead neighborhood of Atlanta last fall. Quick underwriting allowed the pair to compete with cash buyers for a property where speed was crucial, Mr. Perez says. "The people selling did not want to wait to move," Mr. Perez says. "I actually closed in less than 15 days."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Perezs' $1.1 million loan from Lima One included costs to open up the floor plan, install high-end appliances and luxury finishes, and upgrade to new electrical, plumbing and mechanical systems. Father and son plan to list the house for $1.5 million in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The downside: The loan charged 11.9% interest. Hard money interest rates run from 8% to 14% -- two to three times more than current jumbo mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are a few more considerations investors, and even high-end home buyers, may want to keep in mind about hard money loans:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Different documentation. Borrowers need to provide architectural plans, detailed construction budgets, contractor bid sheets and an appraisal to support the anticipated post-renovation sales price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Points and fine print. Some lenders require the borrower to prepay rate points and/or add "junk fees" such as underwriting, processing or lockbox fees at closing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renovate, then refinance. Home flippers are the main market, but Austin, Tex.-based lender Pride of Austin Capital Partners says it is receiving some referrals from mortgage brokers and banks for home buyers of fixer-uppers who have trouble qualifying for a sufficient loan amount to cover improvement expenses, says Managing Member David Owen. Once improvements are completed, the appraised value may be higher, allowing the borrower to refinance to a mortgage, he adds.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. home builders ramped up construction this summer as more families entered the market, but a tumble in August and other obstacles are clouding the sector's outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of residential units surged to a post-recession high in July before falling last month, settling at an annual rate of 956,000 new units. That was 8% higher compared with a year ago, and over the three-month period through August, construction was up 14% year over year, Commerce Department figures showed Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Progress has been scattered. Stronger job growth and ultra-low interest rates haven't translated into a big increase in single-family construction this year, as rising prices and weak income growth weigh on the for-sale market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for apartments, meanwhile, has been strong as younger Americans start their own households. But hundreds of thousands of Americans are still sitting on the sidelines, opting to live with parents or roommates to cut costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Without an increase in household formation, demand for additional housing stock will remain low," <span class="companylink">IHS</span> Global Insight economists Patrick Newport and Stephanie Karol said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The outlook remains unclear. Building permits, a bellwether of future construction, fell in August after a big increase in July, but they were still up 5% from a year earlier. And a report from the industry trade group the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> this week showed a measure of optimism among home builders reached the highest level this month since late 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's report showed August's construction drop owed mostly to a 32% fall in construction of the volatile multifamily segment -- typically apartments and condominiums. Building of single-family units, roughly two-thirds of the market, fell a more modest 2.4% in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home building declined earlier this year but has largely recovered along with the broader housing market amid stronger employment growth. As more Americans get jobs, families are gradually re-entering the market for homes. And mortgage interest rates have fallen back to year-ago levels, luring many buyers who had been scared off by a run-up in borrowing costs late last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other signs point to momentum in housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes -- the bulk of the market -- have climbed steadily this summer after falling late last year and this winter, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But sales of newly built homes fell in June and July, Commerce Department figures show. That could be a sign buyers are increasingly price-sensitive and going for cheaper, existing units. Many families also continue to rent, driving up apartment construction.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Candace Taylor </div><div>1373 words</div><div>18 September 2014</div><div>08:22</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While eating lunch at a local cafe, Andrew Spinney heard from a friend that Paynter Farm—a 210-year-old house on 10 acres down the street from his childhood home in Essex, Mass.—was on the market. Mr. Spinney ran out of the restaurant, headed straight to the farm and started negotiating with the owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was only later that he told his fiancée what had happened. " 'Hey, what would you think about moving?,' " he recalls asking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly everyone has the experience of glimpsing a seemingly unattainable home and dreaming about moving in some day. But very few make those dreams a reality. When house hunters do find a way to buy their longtime dream homes, it is often a yearslong process that requires tremendous persistence, patience and a bit of luck. And as Mr. Spinney discovered, emotion often plays a powerful role in these purchases, sometimes overcoming practicality in a way that he likened to romance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's sort of like falling in love with somebody—you just are," said Mr. Spinney.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling in love with a particular home—sometimes before ever setting foot in it—is fairly common, said Paul Purcell, managing director of the real-estate firm William Raveis New York City. Nearly every city has highly coveted spots that lend themselves to this kind of real-estate longing, whether it is Philadelphia's Rittenhouse Square or the Dakota, the iconic building on New York's Upper West Side. "Every place in the U.S., there are neighborhoods that people drive through and say, 'One day,'" Mr. Purcell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Celebrities and top executives are hardly immune to the impulse: Earlier this year, Oprah Winfrey purchased about 60 acres of land near Telluride Ski Resort in Colorado after first trying to buy it 10 years ago, and TV weatherman Willard Scott said he bought a waterfront cottage in Guilford, Conn. before ever going inside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes coveting a specific property means paying a higher price. "It's like a Birkin bag," Mr. Purcell said. "Is it really worth what it sold for? But [buyers] have to have it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Spinney first fell for Paynter Farm—named for a family that owned it in the 1800s—when he was 10. He'd ride his bike to the farm, which overlooks the Essex River, and do odd jobs around the place. Later, he'd take care of the horses and sheep while owners Bob and Daphne Borden were out of town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now vice president of his family business, the Gloucester, Mass.-based resin maker Anchor-Seal, Mr. Spinney, 45, was "not even remotely in the market" when he heard that the farm was available. He'd already built a roughly 4,000-square-foot house with heated marble floors in nearby Hamilton that "I thought was my retirement home." But when he learned that the farm was for sale, he felt almost powerless to resist. "I could not for the life of me say 'no' to buying this place," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luckily, his fiancée was supportive of the plan. Earlier this year Mr. Spinney paid $2 million for the property, which includes a four-bedroom main house, a one-bedroom guesthouse, a barn and some 40 sheep and chickens. It had been listed for $2.225 million with Lanse Robb of LandVest, an exclusive affiliate of Christie's International Real Estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Anne Margaret Baum, it was love at first sight—and then a wait of more than 15 years. She first saw the Bedford, N.Y., home while attending a charity fundraiser in 1974. She immediately loved the stately, rambling Beaux-Arts home, which at the time had 13 bedrooms and extensive gardens. "As soon as I saw it, I knew I wanted it," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It didn't come on the market until 1987. Ms. Baum and her husband, Dennis, who works in finance, made an offer—which the seller declined. Then, the house went into foreclosure. Rather than give up, Ms. Baum saw the foreclosure as a promising sign that they'd eventually end up with the house, and she kept tabs on the lengthy process with help from her real-estate agent Sally Slater, who is now at <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>. "I was stalking it," Ms. Baum laughed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Baum felt so certain the house would be hers someday, she even started buying furniture for it. Over the next few years, "if I was traveling and I saw pieces of furniture that I thought might work in this house, I bought them," said Ms. Baum, who is an interior designer. And when she was asked to design a room for a decorator showcase house, she selected a space "that had the height and number of windows in the dining room of this house."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1991, the house became available again. The Baums made another offer and it was accepted. (Ms. Baum declined to say what they paid for the house.) They closed and set to work immediately on a renovation that reconfigured the house to seven bedrooms and around 10,000 square feet. The yellow silk curtains Ms. Baum selected for the show house now hang in her dining room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although their house is likely now worth around $5 million, according to Ms. Slater, Ms. Baum said she never wants to leave—she's renovating the property's carriage house so she and her husband can move there when they get older, giving the main house to one of their children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Architectural designer Kevin A. Clark and his wife Lisa first saw their Spanish Colonial Revival-style home in Ojai, Calif. around 1989 on a weekend trip. The stucco house, built around 1921, was designed by George Washington Smith, one of Mr. Clark's architectural idols. It would be another 17 years before they ended up moving to the town, and when they did the house wasn't for sale. They initially lived in two other homes before the Smith house became available. They bought it for $2.29 million in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few years ago, the couple's daughter got married under an oak tree in the backyard; their son is planning to get married at the house. "It's been kind of magical," Ms. Clark said. She added that she and her husband have bought and sold about 15 homes over the years, but "this one, we don't want to leave."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Susan and Jack Engel also waited years to be reunited with their dream house. They first saw L'Hammock Island—a 1-acre spit of land about 1½ miles off the Connecticut coast—in the 1960s as a young couple. In the 1980s, a three-story wood Victorian on L'Hammock (also spelled El Hammock) came on the market. The couple loved it and considered buying it, only to realize an unheated house only reachable by boat was too impractical for a family with two high school-aged children. They bought in nearby New Canaan instead, said Ms. Engel, who is now a real-estate agent at Barbara Cleary's Realty Guild, a Christie's affiliate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When she heard in 1996 that the house was on the market again, "I almost fainted," she said. This time they weren't willing to miss out—they bought the house for $249,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Infatuation doesn't always result in true love. Mr. Purcell, the New York real-estate executive, notes that his clients have sometimes developed attachments to buildings when viewed from the outside, only to discover that the interiors don't live up to their mental image.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That wasn't the case for Mr. Purcell. He got his first glimpse of the Fifth Avenue condo building Olympic Tower in 1976, shortly after moving to Manhattan. To Mr. Purcell, who had been raised in a rural town in California, "it just looked so glamorous."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1999, after he'd become an executive at Douglas Elliman, he and his then-partner bought a roughly 1,300-square-foot unit in Olympic Tower for $810,000—more than 20 years after Mr. Purcell had first seen the building. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Entertainment mogul Robert F.X. Sillerman is looking to unload a chunk of his personal real-estate portfolio: Six of his homes in Manhattan, Anguilla and the Hamptons are available for a total of $107 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sillerman, founder of the electronic-dance-music conglomerate <span class="companylink">SFX Entertainment</span>, has listed his eight-bedroom oceanfront home in Southampton, top right, for $39 million with Tim Davis of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>. He will list a roughly 37,000-square-foot estate on the Caribbean island of Anguilla for $19.5 million with Trophy Properties. He is selling three smaller Anguilla villas, one of which can be seen at top, and will relist one of his Manhattan townhouses, above, at the reduced price of $28 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If purchased together, the listings "afford somebody the opportunity to buy a global lifestyle in one fell swoop," said Caroline Holl of Corcoran, who is listing Mr. Sillerman's 70th Street townhouse along with Leighton Candler.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sillerman, 66, said in an email that he and his wife, Laura, still have property in each of the three locations, but "this is a step toward simplifying our lives." Among his holdings that aren't on the market: four other Hamptons properties, a parcel of waterfront land in Anguilla and a Manhattan townhouse on 72nd Street that he bought in 2013 for $12 million, according to public records.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Alessia Pirolo and Robbie Whelan </div><div>1143 words</div><div>9 September 2014</div><div>10:42</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Europe was slow to embrace real-estate investment trusts, but a record surge in fundraising is providing a boost to the Continent's recovering commercial-property market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, 10 new REITs in Ireland, Spain, the U.K. and other countries have raised $4.2 billion through August, a record for the first eight months of a year, according to data provider Dealogic. That is up from 10 offerings with proceeds of $1.9 billion in all of 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, 2014 is on track to beat the previous record year in 2006, when 26 REIT initial public offerings raised $5.1 billion, according to Dealogic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new offerings come as the eurozone is recovering from a downturn that was triggered in part by real-estate bubbles in several European countries. Many European banks are still struggling with large portfolios of distressed loans, and the landscapes in some countries are dotted with unfinished developments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The REIT structure, which was first introduced in the U.S. in the 1960s, is attractive to companies because they pay little or no corporate taxes and popular with investors because REITs have to distribute the majority of their income as dividends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European governments didn't begin approving them until the 1990s and the early part of the last decade. Until recently, the market was undeveloped partly because relatively small European real-estate companies had more access to bank financing than those in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The European market capitalization of real-estate listed companies was €144.8 billion ($186.72 billion) as of August, up from €105.1 billion in 2013, but still well below the €282.8 billion in Asia and €497.3 billion in North America, according to data from the <span class="companylink">European Public Real Estate Association</span>, which represents Europe's publicly listed property companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts compare the boom in European REIT IPOs to the surge in new listings in the U.S. that followed the commercial real-estate collapse of the early 1990s. "If I were the Spanish government or the Greek or Italian government, and I had a problem where I had a lot of property that was in the wrong hands and needed to be liquidated, I would want to have a healthy functioning REIT regime to help me with that," said John Lutzius, who heads the London office of Green Street Advisors, a real-estate research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are a few differences between the U.S. in the early 1990s and Europe today. In the U.S., most of the IPOs were done by existing real-estate companies whose portfolios were overleveraged, and they used the new equity to shore up their balance sheets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Europe, most of the companies that have gone public in the past year didn't own large portfolios of property. Instead, investors are using the IPOs to raise money to buy property at attractive prices following real-estate slumps in several countries, such as Spain, Italy and Ireland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The largest IPO this year was by Merlin Properties SOCIMI SA, of Spain, a company formed by two former executives of <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank AG</span>'s real-estate unit in Spain and the former head of European real estate for <span class="companylink">Brookfield Asset Management</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Merlin raised €1.25 billion and expects to have invested 92% of it by the end of this year, company executives said. Its purchases include Marineda City shopping center in La Coruña, the largest retail complex in the country, for €260 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Given our scale, we can do larger transactions than other SOCIMI," said David Brush, Merlin's chief investment officer, referring to the Spanish term for the REIT structure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REIT IPOs first started showing up in Ireland in 2013, after the Irish government introduced new REIT legislation. The new players include <span class="companylink">Green REIT PLC</span>, which mostly owns Dublin office buildings, and <span class="companylink">Hibernia REIT PLC</span>, which has acquired loan portfolios as well as office properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spain has seen the most IPOs in Europe in the recent REIT boom, with four listings this year and more to come. <span class="companylink">Quabit Inmobiliaria SA</span> is seeking to raise about €500 million this year, which it plans to use to buy residential and commercial property, according to people familiar with the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi in August signed a package of measures softening the country's existing REIT regulation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is currently interest in Italian real estate, but there are not enough listed vehicles to satisfy the demand," said Henri Quadrelli, an analyst with <span class="companylink">Société Générale SA</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Performance of the new European REITs has been mixed. Green REIT and Hibernia REIT have risen 33% and 14%, respectively, from their IPO prices, thanks to rising values in Ireland. In Spain, shares of <span class="companylink">Lar España Real Estate SOCIMI SA</span> have dropped 6.2% since the company's IPO in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said some REITs have fared relatively poorly partly because their management teams are untested, and, with property prices already on the rise, they haven't invested all the proceeds they have raised. While the first in the new crop of IPOs were mostly well received, "I believe that investors will be more discriminating on the next round of such deals," Mr. Lutzius said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hibernia CEO Kevin Nowlan said the company's performance has been positive thanks to a management team with good knowledge of the domestic market. "We make decisions very quickly and act very quickly," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement following an earning release this week, Green REIT Chairman Gary Kennedy said the company is gaining momentum, as he pointed to improvements in Ireland's economy and real-estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lar España Chairman José Luis del Valle said a slow stock market was the main reason for the company's poor start.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">International investors are looking at the new REITs as a way of participating in the European recovery. George Soros's Quantum Strategic Partners Ltd. and <span class="companylink">Paulson &amp; Co</span>. have purchased large stakes in Green REIT and Hibernia REIT in Ireland and <span class="companylink">Hispania Activos Inmobiliarios SA</span> and Lar España in Spain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, European REITs also are benefiting from increasing interest among institutional investors in global REIT funds. These funds have seen large inflows over the past five years, from $18.9 billion in net assets in mid-2009 to $47.3 billion through the first half of 2014, according to Morningstar. This is due partly because investors believe property values in the U.S. are unlikely to rise much further in the short term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As much as we like the U.S. economy right now, you can't buy U.S. real-estate companies for 20%, 30% discount to their book value," said Marc Halle, global head of real-estate securities for Prudential Real Estate Investors.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Key Biscayne, Fla. home on a 2-acre peninsula with a private harbor will list for $60 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it sells for its asking price, the property could set a record for the priciest residential sale in the Miami area, said Jorge E. Uribe of ONE <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>, who shares the listing with Tata Botero, also of ONE Sotheby's International Realty. The current record was set by the $47 million sale of an Indian Creek Island house in 2012, Mr. Uribe said. A penthouse at Faena House in Miami Beach priced at $50 million is in contract, but hasn't yet closed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Known as Mashta Point, the hook-shaped property juts into Biscayne Bay. The property is the former site of Mashta House, an extravagant home built around 1917 by plantation owner W.J. Matheson, who once owned much of Key Biscayne, Mr. Uribe said. Mr. Matheson also created Mashta Point's man-made cove and deep-water harbor, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mashta House was later torn down, Mr. Uribe said. The current roughly 12,000-square-foot house was built by his clients in the early 1990s, he said. It has six bedrooms, eight full bathrooms and an elevator. Outside, there is a pool, gazebo and dock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Uribe declined to identify the seller, but public records list the owner as a corporation associated with Fernando Caballero, who couldn't be reached for comment. The owners have used it for many years as a vacation home and have also rented it out, Mr. Uribe said. The house is currently on the rental market asking $50,000 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property's unique crescent shape gives it expansive views of the bay and the Miami skyline, Mr. Uribe said. "You feel like you're on a yacht in the middle of the ocean," he said. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Palatial Price: Florida Mansion Seeks $139 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 60,500-square-foot home under construction in Hillsboro Beach, Fla., is listed for $139 million. Many agents believe it is the most expensive listing in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dubbed Le Palais Royal, the 11-bedroom, 17-bathroom home was inspired by the Palace of Versailles, and other European palaces and castles, said Denio Madera, the Miami-based architect and interior designer who is handling the interior design of the home. Surrounded by a gate that is decorated with 22-karat gold leaf, the house includes a $2 million marble staircase, a subterranean garage that can accommodate 30 cars and an 18-seat IMAX home theater with a 50-foot-wide screen. There are three master suites and a presidential suite, each with its own Jacuzzi in a windowed circular rotunda (the presidential suite also has a plunge pool on an outdoor terrace).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside, there is a 4,500-square-foot infinity pool with salt, chlorine and UV filtering as well as an LED-lit, double-loop water slide. Suspended above the pool is a glass-bottomed Jacuzzi. "It's supposed to feel like you're floating over the pool," said Mr. Madera.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The entire home was built to be soundproof. The home's South African marble floors were insulated specifically so the clacking of high heels will be muted, added William Pierce of <span class="companylink">Coldwell Banker Residential Real Estate</span>, who has the listing. The house is built with an elaborate security system as well as kennels for guard dogs on the lower level. The house sits on 4.4-acres with 465 feet of waterfront on the Atlantic Ocean and 492 feet of waterfront on the Intracoastal Waterway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between Boca Raton and Fort Lauderdale, Hillsboro Beach is a small community consisting of large condominium buildings and just a few dozen single-family homes. According to Carmen D'Angelo, a broker with Premier Estate Properties, a Christie's International Real Estate affiliate, the highest price home sale in the area so far was $17 million earlier this year. Mr. D'Angelo said he will soon be listing a speculative home in Hillsboro Beach for $45 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pierce says the owner of Palais Royal had the land appraised a year and a half ago for more than $40 million, and has spent over $75 million on construction and design to build the home so far. Joseph Leone, the owner's representative and the project manager who has overseen the home's construction, said the home has been under construction since 2009 and is slated to be completed by the end of 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Leone said the home has been many years in the making because of its large size and the way it is being constructed. Built atop 350, 150-foot underground pilings, the home and the roof are made entirely of poured concrete, and interior walls are paneled with plaster molding. The result is very sturdy and built to resist any storm. "The things you don't see are basically double the cost, and take double the time," said Mr. Madera, the designer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to public records, the property is owned in a trust tied to Robert Pereira, the founder of <span class="companylink">Middlesex Corp</span>., a Massachusetts-based construction company that also has offices in Florida. Mr. Leone said the owner is selling because he just finished building a yacht and wants to spend more time traveling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home's $139 million listing price tops the $135 million asking price for a Beverly Hills, Calif., home formerly owned by William Randolph Hearst. A property in Los Angeles's Holmby Hills neighborhood has reportedly been shopped around for $150 million, though it isn't officially listed.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property includes a 1,746-square-foot separate fitness facility with a locker room and showers as well as a tennis court. There is also a swimming pool with a two-story water slide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Johnson and his wife, Lisa, spent more than three years building the home, says listing broker Robert Joffe, of the Joffe Group at <span class="companylink">Berkshire Hathaway</span> HomeServices. According to public records, the Johnsons purchased the property in 2003 for $2.7 million. Mr. Joffe says they spent more than $30 million building out the property, which also includes a large guesthouse and resort-like grounds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This was truly a labor of love . . . it was kind of [Mrs. Johnson's] dream and her inspiration," says Mr. Joffe, who shares the listing with Jonathan Friedland. Mr. Joffe says the Johnsons, who couldn't be reached to comment, are selling because two of their four children have left home, and the family is looking to downsize.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like 'A Small City': A Large Montecito Estate Lists For $125 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A roughly 237-acre estate -- one of the largest residential properties in the affluent oceanfront community of Montecito, Calif. -- has listed for $125 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Known as Rancho San Carlos, the property has a roughly 30,000-square-foot main house with 12 bedrooms and 10 full and three half bathrooms, according to listing agents Suzanne Perkins and Harry Kolb of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>. The estate also has 10 cottages, equestrian facilities, a small office building and about 100 acres of citrus and avocado orchards. "It's almost like a small city," said Mr. Kolb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Montecito, about 90 miles north of Los Angeles and adjacent to Santa Barbara, boasts some of the priciest real estate in the country and has attracted celebrity residents such as Oprah Winfrey and Ellen DeGeneres. Montecito hasn't yet seen a home sale crack the $100 million mark, Ms. Perkins said, though she said she sold nearly 25,000 acres of ranchland elsewhere in Santa Barbara County in 2007 for about $135 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In setting the $125 million listing price, Ms. Perkins and Mr. Kolb pointed to the roughly 23-acre Huguette Clark estate, "Bellosguardo," in Santa Barbara, which they said is believed to be worth more than $100 million. The Rancho San Carlos estate is "one of a kind," said Randy Solakian of Coldwell Banker Previews International.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rancho San Carlos has been owned for nearly 90 years by the same family, said Jim Jackson, whose grandparents, rancher and property investor Charles H. Jackson Jr. and his wife, Ann, bought the land in the late 1920s and built the house. Charles died in the 1970s and his wife in 1990, Mr. Jackson said. Since then the family has maintained the property, but hasn't used the main house as a full-time residence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With mountain and ocean views, the Monterey Colonial-style house is built around an interior courtyard. The house has an English-style pub downstairs, Mr. Jackson said, accessed by a hidden door -- not surprising for a house designed during Prohibition. Below the pub is an underground badminton court with an observation gallery. The house also has a tower office accessible only from the master suite by an exterior staircase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Santa Barbara has long been a hub for polo, and Mr. Jackson said his grandparents were active participants in the sport. They also bred race horses and dogs on the property, which has a barn and stable complex, outdoor paddocks, a trophy room, a roughly 11,250-square-foot covered riding arena and an outdoor training track. The 10 small cottages have mostly been used to house employees, Mr. Jackson said. At one time there were some 30 horses on the property, he said, but there are now only a few.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The family is selling because they are spread out across the country and the property has become too difficult to maintain given family members' different priorities and objectives, Mr. Jackson said. "It's hard for us to let it go, but it's too hard to keep," he said, adding: "Everyone would like to have somebody buy it and keep it together."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fallon Buys Again</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Tonight Show" star Jimmy Fallon has purchased a fifth unit in his Manhattan apartment building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, the talk show host and his wife Nancy paid $725,000 for a top-floor studio at 34 Gramercy Park East, according to records filed with the city. The purchase in the nine-story, roughly 35-unit co-op follows the couple's April purchase of the four-bedroom apartment next door to the studio for $1.35 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to listing agent Jessica Huff of Halstead Property, the couple told the building's co-op board they plan to use the new apartment as an office. Ms. Huff said she doesn't know whether the Fallons plan to combine the studio with the larger apartment next door or with the others they own in the building. A spokeswoman for Mr. Fallon didn't respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A strengthening manufacturing sector is fueling expectations that the U.S. economy will expand at a more robust clip in the second half of the year. But manufacturers are concerned that international turmoil could temper the rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management said Tuesday its purchasing managers' index -- a compilation of readings on orders, production, employment, supplier deliveries and inventories -- climbed to 59.0 in August, from 57.1 in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists had expected the gauge to fall, but instead the latest reading rose to its best showing since March 2011. Another factory survey, released Tuesday by data provider Markit, showed manufacturing activity in August was the busiest since April 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM said 17 of the 18 industries surveyed reported growth in August. "This is broad-based strength," said Bradley Holcomb, who oversees the survey for the ISM.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upbeat factory numbers bolstered the view of many economists that the U.S. economy is picking up steam in the second half of the year. A large 1.8% gain in construction spending in July, according to a Commerce Department gauge released Tuesday, also adds to expectations of faster growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These ISM numbers are about as good as it gets," said Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors. "It's hard to make the argument that this economy is not accelerating." Mr. Naroff projects the economy will grow at an annual rate of 3.2% this quarter and will surge at a 4.6% pace in the fourth quarter, led by faster wage growth and better government spending. Real GDP expanded at about a 1.1% annual rate in the first half.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within the ISM factory report, many indexes hit or held near multiyear highs last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The August new-orders index increased to a 10-year high of 66.7. The production index rose to 64.5, the best reading since May 2010. The employment index was virtually unchanged at 58.1 from the three-year high of 58.2 hit in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Holcomb said last month's ISM employment reading is consistent with "a good, solid gain" in August manufacturing jobs. The <span class="companylink">Labor Department</span> is scheduled to release its August employment report on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there is a dark cloud in manufacturers' blue skies, it is overseas developments, Mr. Holcomb said. Demand in the eurozone and China is slowing, holding down foreign sales. The ISM exports index increased to 55.0 in August from 53.0 in July, but both readings are below the 55.6 averaged in the first half of 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists caution that unless foreign demand picks up, the upbeat factory numbers won't last.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. consumers viewed the economy with increased optimism in August, hinting at a strong jobs report for the month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span>, a private research group, said its index of consumer confidence rose to 92.4 in August from a revised 90.3 in July (first reported as 90.9). The August index is the highest since October 2007, before the recession started. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had forecast the index would fall to 88.5.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The present situation index, gauging consumers' assessment of current economic conditions, jumped to 94.6 from a revised 87.9 in July (originally 88.3).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers who own homes got more goods news: The S&amp;P Case-Shiller report said home prices nationwide increased 6.2% in the year through June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conference Board survey also showed consumers more upbeat about the labor markets. Some 18.2% of consumers say they think jobs are "plentiful," up from 15.6% in July and the highest reading since early 2008. Another 30.6% think jobs are "hard to get," down from 30.9% saying that last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The difference between the two readings narrowed again in August, suggesting further improvement in the employment report to be released Sept. 5.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers are becoming notably more optimistic about current labor market progress, consistent with the decline in the unemployment rate," said Gennadiy Goldberg, U.S. strategist at <span class="companylink">TD Securities.However</span>, the share of respondents anticipating more jobs in the future fell to 17.0% in August from 18.7% a month ago, while the share anticipating fewer jobs also declined, to 15.8% from 16.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But rising confidence hasn't produced stronger spending. Even for people with jobs, pay raises remain minimal and barely pacing inflation. Small wage gains have held back spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worse still, the board survey shows households don't expect much change in the situation. In August, 15.5% of households expected their earnings would rise in the next six months, down from 17.7% saying that in July and the lowest reading since March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer expectations for economic activity over the next six months fell to 90.9 after that index jumped to a revised 91.9 in July from 86.4 in June. The July expectations index was first reported as 92.7.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer spending is vital to the U.S. economy, accounting for about two-thirds of economic activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kathleen Madigan</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Recovery Accelerates</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. economy's second-quarter rebound was more robust than previously estimated and corporate profits surged, putting the recovery back on track as it ended its fifth year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of goods and services produced across the economy, grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.2% in the second quarter when adjusted for inflation, the Commerce Department said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency had previously estimated the second quarter's growth at 4%, relying on incomplete data for international trade, inventories and other sectors. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected growth for the second quarter to be marked down to a 3.8% pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"On balance, today's revisions, though small, should be seen as positive news for the growth outlook and make us more confident in our projection of continued solid growth" in the second half of 2014, <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span> economist Laura Rosner said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ben Leubsdorf</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for Homes Grows</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of contracts signed to buy previously owned homes rose in July, a sign that steady job growth is supporting a rebound in housing demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An index of pending home sales, reflecting purchases under contract but not yet closed, rose 3.3% to 105.9 in July from June, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Thursday. That was a bigger gain than the 0.6% rise forecast by economists and placed the index comfortably over the 100 level that the trade group says indicates "normal" sales activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending home sales have now risen four of the past five months, though the index remains 2.1% below its level from a year ago. A regional breakdown of the July data showed sales rising in the Northeast, South and West, though they fell in the Midwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While housing-market data has remained somewhat choppy, the housing sector recovery continues to chug along" at a reasonable rate, says TD Securities strategist Gennadiy Goldberg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest report showed sales of existing homes, which account for around 90% of the market, continuing to gain steam after softening in late 2013 and early 2014. A rise in mortgage rates and then unusually harsh winter weather had helped to derail a housing-sector recovery that began in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan House</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank Lending Expands</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. banks increased their loan balances in the second quarter of 2014 by levels not seen since before the financial crisis, offering evidence of a pickup in lending as the economy slowly recovers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp</span>. said banks' loan and lease balances grew by $178.5 billion to $8.11 trillion, a 2.3% increase over the previous quarter and the largest quarterly jump since the last quarter of 2007. Commercial and industrial loans, residential mortgages, credit-card balances, and auto loans contributed to the growth, the agency said in its quarterly report of banks' health.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FDIC also said the banking industry continued to recover from the financial crisis, though banks are still having trouble boosting revenues in a low-interest-rate environment. Banks as a whole recorded second-quarter net income of $40.2 billion, the FDIC said, a 5.3% increase from a year earlier. The FDIC said that of the 6,656 U.S. financial institutions, the number on its "problem" list dropped to 354, the smallest count in five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ryan Tracy</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonbank Mortgages Surge</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonbank lenders made almost a quarter of all mortgage loans in the first half of the year, the highest level since at least the financial crisis, according to data on the top-30 mortgage originators from industry newsletter Inside Mortgage Finance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage lending at big banks such as <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo &amp; Co</span>. and <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span> has dropped more quickly than the rest of the industry in the wake of large mortgage-related legal settlements, new banking standards that require lenders to carry more capital, and increased scrutiny from regulators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quicken Loans, the largest mortgage lender outside traditional banks, made $24.3 billion of loans in the first half, putting it on a par with <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> and ahead of <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>, according to Inside Mortgage Finance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise of nonbank lenders is good news for consumers who otherwise might not be able to get a bank loan in the current environment. For banks, this marks a retreat from a business that used to be very profitable but has turned into a legal and financial headache since the crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joe Light</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for Durables Jump</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for big-ticket manufactured goods jumped to a record in July thanks to a surge in aircraft purchases, while underlying gauges of demand indicated strong momentum in broad business spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of durable goods—products like airplanes, cars and heavy machinery that are designed to last at least three years—rose a seasonally adjusted 22.6% to $300.1 billion in July from the prior month, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. That was the sharpest increase and highest level in a data series dating back to 1992. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had forecast a 7.5% increase over June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">J.H.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Farm Incomes Set to Fall</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. farm incomes are expected to fall 13.8% this year to the lowest level in four years as record harvests push down prices for key crops, the <span class="companylink">U.S. Department of Agriculture</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal forecasters projected net farm income would slide to $113.2 billion from an estimated $131.3 billion in 2013, which was the highest since 1973 on an inflation-adjusted basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The projected decline is narrower than the 27% drop the <span class="companylink">USDA</span> forecast in February. The change is due largely to an improved outlook for livestock farmers, who are benefiting from record prices for beef and pork as well as low prices for corn and other grains used in animal feed. The USDA said on Tuesday that it expects livestock farmers' receipts to rise 15% this year, compared with a February projection of a 0.7% rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jesse Newman</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fewer Accept Pay Cuts</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More Americans are bouncing back after losing their jobs, and fewer are accepting a pay cut as the price of returning to work. Some 9.5 million people lost their jobs between January 2011 and December 2013, including 4.3 million who lost jobs they had held for at least three years, the <span class="companylink">Labor Department</span> said Tuesday in its biennial survey of displaced workers. As of January 2014, 61% were back at work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By comparison, less than half of the 15.4 million workers who lost their jobs from 2007 through 2009, during the recession years, were re-employed at the beginning of 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">B.L.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Old Times</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, a prominent student of the Great Depression, says the 2008 financial crisis was actually worse than its 1930s counterpart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bernanke is quoted making the statement in a document filed on Aug. 22 with the U.S. Court of Federal Claims as part of a lawsuit linked to the 2008 government bailout of insurance giant <span class="companylink">American International Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"September and October of 2008 was the worst financial crisis in global history, including the Great Depression," Mr. Bernanke is quoted as saying in the document. Of the 13 "most important financial institutions in the United States, 12 were at risk of failure within a period of a week or two."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Former Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is quoted in the document offering a similarly apocalyptic assessment. From Sept. 6 through Sept. 22, the economy was essentially "in free fall," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for Durables Jump</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for big-ticket manufactured goods jumped to a record in July thanks to a surge in aircraft purchases, while underlying gauges of demand indicated strong momentum in broad business spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of durable goods—products like airplanes, cars and heavy machinery that are designed to last at least three years—rose a seasonally adjusted 22.6% to $300.1 billion in July from the prior month, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was the sharpest increase and highest level in a data series dating back to 1992. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had forecast a 7.5% increase over June.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Farm Incomes Set to Fall</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. farm incomes are expected to fall 13.8% this year to the lowest level in four years as record harvests push down prices for key crops, the <span class="companylink">U.S. Department of Agriculture</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal forecasters projected net farm income would slide to $113.2 billion from an estimated $131.3 billion in 2013, which was the highest since 1973 on an inflation-adjusted basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The projected decline is narrower than the 27% drop the <span class="companylink">USDA</span> forecast in February. The change is due largely to an improved outlook for livestock farmers, who are benefiting from record prices for beef and pork as well as low prices for corn and other grains used in animal feed. The USDA said on Tuesday that it expects livestock farmers' receipts to rise 15% this year, compared with a February projection of a 0.7% rise.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fewer Accept Pay Cuts</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More Americans are bouncing back after losing their jobs, and fewer are accepting a pay cut as the price of returning to work. Some 9.5 million people lost their jobs between January 2011 and December 2013, including 4.3 million who lost jobs they had held for at least three years, the <span class="companylink">Labor Department</span> said Tuesday in its biennial survey of displaced workers. As of January 2014, 61% were back at work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By comparison, less than half of the 15.4 million workers who lost their jobs in the 2007-09 recession were re-employed at the beginning of 2010.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Big Unit has a big house—and it is about to go on the market for a big asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, retired Major League Baseball pitcher Randy Johnson will list his 25,000-square-foot Paradise Valley, Ariz., estate for $25 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three-story Mediterranean-style home is on 5 acres and has seven bedrooms and 12 bathrooms. The room that currently serves as Mr. Johnson's office has wood-paneled walls, an adjoining poker room and a window that overlooks a three-car display garage for collectible cars. (There is also a separate eight-car motor court.) Other amenities include a sports-memorabilia display room, a pet suite with a washing station and a play area and a game room with a Western-themed billiards parlor and bar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the lower level of the home there is a 20-seat movie theater with stadium-style seating, a working ticket booth and a marquee. The home also has a recording studio, a separate stage with lighting and sound equipment and a collector's musical instrument showroom, which currently displays guitars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property includes a 1,746-square-foot separate fitness facility with a locker room and showers as well as a tennis court. There is also a swimming pool with a two-story water slide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Johnson and his wife, Lisa, spent more than three years building the home, says listing broker Robert Joffe, of the Joffe Group at <span class="companylink">Berkshire Hathaway</span> HomeServices. According to public records, the Johnsons purchased the property in 2003 for $2.7 million. Mr. Joffe says they spent more than $30 million building out the property, which also includes a large guesthouse and resort-like grounds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's truly a family home," says Mr. Joffe, who shares the listing with Jonathan Friedland. "This was truly a labor of love… it was kind of [Mrs. Johnson's] dream and her inspiration." Mr. Joffe says the Johnsons, who couldn't be reached for comment, are selling because two of the couple's four children have left home, and the family is looking to downsize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Trulia.com, the most expensive home sale ever publicly recorded in Paradise Valley was a 10,850-square-foot home that sold in 2006 for $10.2 million. The priciest listing on the market today is a 16,370-square-foot home asking $30 million. Mr. Joffe says there really aren't comparable sales to this property, and that the list price was determined by taking into account what it cost to build the home and current market conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nicknamed the Big Unit, Mr. Johnson, a 6-foot-10-inch tall left-handed pitcher, played 22 seasons for teams including the <span class="companylink">New York Yankees</span>, the <span class="companylink">San Francisco Giants</span>, the <span class="companylink">Seattle Mariners</span> and the <span class="companylink">Houston Astros</span>. From 1999 to 2004, he played for the <span class="companylink">Arizona Diamondbacks</span>, leading the team to its first World Series win in 2001 against the Yankees. The five-time Cy Young Award winner retired in 2010. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Call it the halo effect for real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A study of the housing market in Hamburg, Germany, found that condos located between 100 to 200 meters, or 109 to 219 yards, away from a place of worship listed for an average 4.8% more than other homes. The effect was similar across all religious buildings studied, including churches, mosques and temples.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's something we find for other amenities, as well," said Wolfgang Maennig, a professor at the University of Hamburg Department of Economics and Social Sciences and co-author of the report. He likens the price bump to perks such as proximity to public transportation and sports arenas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But live too close to the religious building -- within 100 meters -- and the premium is erased, they found. Sounds associated with houses of worship are only part of the problem. The effect of bell ringing, for example, wasn't statistically significant, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The article, in the journal Growth and Change, studied the listing prices of 4,832 condo units in Hamburg between 2002 and 2008, and measured their distance to places of worship. The study controlled for variables such as access to jobs, neighborhood quality and property type.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners might value proximity to places of worship because they often offer community programs for children and the elderly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Even if you don't need it, it's an option," Dr. Maennig said. Deconsecrated and converted churches had the same effect on condo prices, suggesting that home buyers value the view. After all, Hamburg is filled with beautiful, centuries-old churches, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether the same applies to U.S. markets is unclear. A case study in Contemporary Economic Policy in 2012 looked at the effect of a newly built Mormon temple in Omaha, Neb., on home-sale prices. After comparing prices before and after the temple was completed in 2011, no noticeable bump was found, said co-author Eric Thompson, associate professor of economics, University of Nebraska-Lincoln.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still others praise the value of religious buildings. "I have a lot of clients who purely base their searches on where their church is," said Peter Lane, an agent with TTR Sotheby's International Realty in Washington, D.C., who lists multimillion-dollar homes. Churches make great neighbors, he said, "If you don't mind a bit of noise or church bells."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nancy Keates  </div><div>1003 words</div><div>28 August 2014</div><div>08:21</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hipsters battling to rent warehouse lofts. Trendy bars, espresso shops and music venues. A funky, celebrity-chef-owned restaurant serving bone marrow and crispy pig ears.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This isn't Brooklyn or Portland. It is downtown Cleveland. Nicknamed the "Mistake on the Lake," the much-maligned city on the shore of Lake Erie has long had a reputation for crime, pollution and corruption. Over the years, Cleveland's downtown became almost a ghost town at night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, Cleveland's fortunes seem to be turning around. LeBron is headed home! The 2016 Republican National Convention is coming! The <span class="companylink">Browns</span> nabbed quarterback Johnny Manziel in the draft! There is lots of exuberance and chest thumping in Cleveland, accompanied by lofty predictions of the positive economic impacts of these events.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But these events come on the back of more than a decade of steady and methodical steps taken by the city to tackle its economic and social issues. Last year, more than $600 million worth of investments were sunk into downtown projects, including a new convention center. A 484-room Westin opened last May, and there are five other hotels planned, including a Kimpton and a Le Méridien.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More people are moving downtown: Between 2000 and 2014, the city's downtown residential population increased 60% to about 13,000. Over 3,100 apartments were created over that same period, according to the Downtown Cleveland Alliance, a nonprofit that works with downtown property owners, with another 2,200 units either under construction or planned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This past May, Rob Briggs did something he'd never have considered a decade ago and bought a 4,200-square-foot, three-bedroom condo in a downtown area called the Flats. Formerly an industrial shipping area long considered seedy and crime-ridden, the Flats are getting cleaned up, with restaurants, offices and even an aquarium now on the west side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A corporate attorney who heads an educational nonprofit, Mr. Briggs, 73, and his wife, Alyssa Lenhoff, paid $700,000 for their condo, which has marbled hallways and bathrooms in a building with a concierge, free parking and a gym. "It used to be super negative here," says Mr. Briggs. "The spirit is a 180 degrees from what it was."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now, the hottest segment of the downtown market is rentals. Roughly 98% of downtown Cleveland apartments are occupied, up from 95% occupancy just a few months earlier, making renting downtown a very competitive exercise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It came to a point where the first question I'd ask, even while we were already there looking at the place, was whether it was still available," says Richard Lobas, a 24-year-old law student working at a Cleveland firm over the summer. He and his girlfriend looked at eight apartments in two months before they finally snagged a 1,000-square-foot, one-bedroom for $1,085 a month in July. Five times—either while he was touring an apartment or a few hours before he was supposed to meet the real-estate agent—he was told the unit had just been rented.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lobas said there was never any question they would live anywhere but downtown. "It was a pretty obvious choice. Everyone is trying to live downtown," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Following that demand, more high-end residential buildings are coming online, most of them renovations of old office spaces. Residences at 1717 will have modern finishes, a fitness center and city views; its 223 apartments go for as much as $2,615 a month for a two-bedroom unit. At the 9, which offers housekeeping, valet and concierge services, a two-bedroom, 3½-bath penthouse unit rents for as much as $5,995 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast, the purchase market hasn't yet recovered from the regional economic recession and the housing bust, which sent foreclosure rates soaring. According to a February report by online real-estate firm <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, buying a home was 56% cheaper than renting in Cleveland, a higher differential than almost every other city in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This summer, Angie Nadiak, a 48-year-old health-care professional, and her husband nixed their idea of renting downtown and bought a 1,900-square-foot, two-bedroom condo for $320,000, $20,000 less than its asking price. In a former cloak factory, the unit has large windows, an open floor plan and a private outdoor area. "It just feels more alive downtown than it used to," says Ms. Nadiak, who had lived in the affluent suburb of Shaker Heights for 25 years. She says she goes out almost every night to listen to music and to eat dinner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, downtown Cleveland can't be called bustling. Its wide streets can often feel oddly empty, with few pedestrians strolling the sidewalks. Retail stores are scarce. There is no supermarket, though local grocery chain Heinen's recently announced plans to open one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there is Cleveland's bumpy economic history. An industrial and shipping mecca in the early 20th century, the city took a particularly hard hit during the Great Depression; it came back in manufacturing, only to suffer in the late 1970s and 1980s as manufacturing across the Rust Belt declined. The city diversified into health care and biotech and came back again in the 1990s, only to be hit by the housing crisis. Earlier this year, <span class="companylink">United Airlines</span> announced it was killing its hub at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"To turn Cleveland into a hip swanky town—that's not something that's going to happen overnight," says Mark Vitner, managing director &amp; senior economist at <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>. Nevertheless, he is optimistic the current changes will be lasting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Briggs is, too. His large deck overlooks the much-cleaner Cuyahoga River, where he watches people row and sail. "It is beautiful," he says. "Really." </p>

</div><div class="author">By Kathleen Madigan </div><div>514 words</div><div>26 August 2014</div><div>07:50</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The yearly growth in home prices across the U.S. continues to slow this year, according to a home price report released Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home price index covering the entire nation increased 6.2% in the 12 months ended in June, said the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index report. In the past the national index was published quarterly but the report noted it will now be released monthly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home price index covering 10 major U.S. cities increased 8.1% in the year ended in June, and the 20-city price index was also up 8.1%. That pace is down from a 9.4% yearly rate in May but close to the 8.2% expected by economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On an unadjusted basis, the national index increased 0.9% in June over May, while the 10-city index and the 20-city composite each increased 1.0%. Seasonally adjusted, the U.S. index fell 0.1% in June, the 10-city gauge slipped 0.1% and the 20-city composite was down 0.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists cautioned seasonal adjustments may exaggerate the recent weakness in home values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists at <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> said in a research note that "seasonal adjustment difficulties may make house prices appear artificially weak in June-November."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend in home prices is important for both the housing sector and household wealth. According to the <span class="companylink">S&amp;P</span> report, as of June 2014, average home prices across the U.S. are back to their levels posted in the spring of 2005, before values collapsed during the ensuing housing bust and recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For the first time since February 2008, all cities showed lower annual rates than the previous month," said David M. Blitzer, Chairman of the Index Committee at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. "Other housing indicators—starts, existing home sales and builders' sentiment—are positive. Taken together, these point to a more normal housing sector."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Mr. Blitzer was cautious about the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Bargain basement mortgage rates won't continue forever," he said, "recent improvements in the labor markets and comments from [Federal Reserve Chairwoman] Janet Yellen and others hint that interest rates could rise as soon as the first quarter of 2015. Rising mortgage rates won't send housing into a tailspin, but will further dampen price gains."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, the fundamentals underlying the housing markets suggest the price slowdown won't accelerate much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A sustained downturn in house prices doesn't look likely while supply conditions are still fairly tight," wrote Paul Diggle, property economist at Capital Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regionally, the south and west are seeing home-price slowdowns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In San Francisco, the pace of price increases halved since late last summer," the report said, "The Sun Belt cities—Las Vegas, Phoenix, Miami and Tampa—all remain a third or more below their peak prices set almost a decade ago." </p>

</div><div class="author">By Christian Berthelsen </div><div>318 words</div><div>26 August 2014</div><div>10:46</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Copper prices slipped on Tuesday, after a closely watched U.S. home-price index missed expectations, amid broader concerns about demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The metal for September delivery, the most actively traded contract, fell 3.2 cents, or 1%, in price to $3.1860 a pound on the Comex division of the <span class="companylink">New York Mercantile Exchange</span>. Volume was less than 25,000 contracts, or about 15% of recent averages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market opened weaker and moved lower still after the release of the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home price index, which missed analysts' expectations and showed prices slowing their growth for the first time in more than six years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Copper investors are leery of signs of trouble in the construction sector because the metal is a core component of wiring and plumbing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adam Klopfenstein, a strategist with Archer Financial in Chicago, said some investors were likely taking cash off the table after failing to notch gains as quickly as expected and seeking returns in better-performing markets such as stocks. "What you're getting is a pullback in copper because a lot of people jumped back in and got too long too quickly," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The miss on home prices follows other recent disappointing data in the U.S. and abroad, including poor manufacturing numbers out of China last week, raising fears about future copper demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Copper is a key component in manufacturing and construction of everything from electronic goods to housing, and China's aggressive growth has made the nation the world's top copper consumer. As such, economic signals there have an outsize impact on prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market shrugged off a report from the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> on Tuesday that showed U.S. consumer confidence in August at its highest since October 2007.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for new homes has largely stalled this year as buyers lean toward lower-priced, previously owned houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new single-family houses declined 2.4% in July from a month earlier to an annual rate of 412,000, the Commerce Department said Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, sales of existing homes have strengthened through the spring and into summer as buyers find properties at prices they can afford and in neighborhoods they want.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales slid across the board in the second half of 2013 after mortgage rates jumped. Sales of existing homes rose over the past four months, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. But sales of new homes have delivered what Michael Moran, an economist at <span class="companylink">Daiwa Capital</span> Markets America, called a "sideways trend" -- with volatile monthly figures showing little momentum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While new-home sales only account for about 10% of U.S. home-buying activity, home building supports the overall U.S. economy as a key source of middle-class jobs. A residential-construction worker earns an average of $32,340 a year, 36% more than a retail-sales employee, according to the <span class="companylink">Labor Department</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bert Selva, president and CEO of Shea Homes, which operates in eight states, said his company's sales increased by midteen percentages in July from a year earlier. But he said the market is cooling: "Buyers have more choices, and therefore they're more patient in making their home-buying decision."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Added Brad Hunter, chief economist for housing-research firm Metrostudy, a unit of <span class="companylink">Hanley Wood LLC</span>: "We're still seeing some lingering effects of sticker shocks" from price increases in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">July sales were well below historical averages. In the decade before the recession began in 2007, nearly 1 million newly built houses were sold a year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, sales of existing homes have strengthened through the spring and into summer as buyers find properties at prices they can afford and in neighborhoods they want.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales slid across the board in the second half of 2013 after mortgage rates jumped. Sales of existing homes rose over the past four months, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. But sales of new homes have delivered what Michael Moran, an economist at <span class="companylink">Daiwa Capital</span> Markets America, called a "sideways trend"—with volatile monthly figures showing little momentum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While new-home sales only account for about 10% of U.S. home-buying activity, home building supports the overall U.S. economy as a key source of middle-class jobs. A residential-construction worker earns an average of $32,340 a year, 36% more than a retail-sales employee, according to the <span class="companylink">Labor Department</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several home builders reported that sales last month were in line with or slightly higher than a year ago, but they said prospective buyers remain hesitant to move ahead with purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite strengthening U.S. job growth this year, a range of other factors have dented the confidence of would-be buyers. A 13.6% increase in median new-home prices from July 2012 has dramatically outpaced lackluster wage growth of about 2% a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage-qualification standards, though slowly easing, are stringent enough to deter some buyers. Meanwhile, an increase in the number of existing homes for sale has created price competition for newly built homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while mortgage rates have fallen since the start of the year, market expectation that the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> might act sooner the previously thought to move to lift benchmark interest rates from near zero could cause rates to move back up later in the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bert Selva, president and CEO of Shea Homes, which operates in eight states, said his company's sales increased by midteen percentages in July from a year earlier. But he said the market is cooling: "Buyers have more choices, and therefore they're more patient in making their home-buying decision."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Added Brad Hunter, chief economist for housing-research firm Metrostudy, a unit of <span class="companylink">Hanley Wood LLC</span>: "We're still seeing some lingering effects of sticker shocks" from price increases in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">July sales were well below historical averages. In the decade before the recession began in late 2007, nearly 1 million newly built houses were sold a year. But some economists don't see new-home sales returning to that level soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The essentially flat market suggests that future growth for new-home sales will depend on the health of the economy, said Steve Blitz, chief economist at ITG Investment Research. "Housing will follow, not lead overall growth," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charter Homes &amp; Neighborhoods, a builder in central Pennsylvania, had 25 homes go under contract in July, roughly the same as a year earlier. President Robert Bowman noted that buyers no longer feel compelled to pounce on available homes because prices aren't rising as quickly as last year and inventory is more plentiful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Traffic was basically flat from last year," Mr. Bowman said of the flow of prospects touring Charter's model homes and communities in July. "Our conversion rate was not what we thought it would be. We thought the market would have been stronger."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Ben Leubsdorf and Nick Timiraos   </div><div>409 words</div><div>22 August 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing recovery gained traction in July as sales of previously owned homes rose to their highest level in 10 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes increased 2.4% from June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.15 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Thursday. July sales were down 4.3% from a year earlier, when sales peaked for 2013 before a jump in mortgage rates threw the housing recovery off track. July was the fourth consecutive month sales rose from the prior month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not only were sales last month at their highest level since last September, but fewer transactions came from short sales of underwater homes and foreclosures. Distressed sales accounted for 9% of all sales in July, the lowest level since the trade group's tally began in October 2008 at the peak of the financial crisis. More than a third of all sales in 2009 were distressed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of existing homes available for sale in July was up 5.8% from a year earlier to 2.37 million, its highest level in nearly two years. "More inventory, in my view, will mean more home sales," said Lawrence Yun, the NAR's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, rising inventories are creating more competition for sellers, which helps explain why prices are rising more slowly than last year. The median sales price in July was up 4.9% from a year earlier, compared with a 13.1% gain in July 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upshot is that the housing market has grown more balanced between buyers and sellers. At the current pace of sales, it would take 5 1/2 months to exhaust the supply of homes for sale, up from 5 months last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes account for roughly 90% of U.S. home-buying activity. The Commerce Department will report new-home sales for July on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market has started to heal in recent years. But sales tumbled last summer as the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> prepared to begin winding down its bond-buying stimulus program and mortgage rates jumped from historically low levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales bottomed out in March and have since risen. Still, the <span class="companylink">Fed</span> has continued to flag the sluggish housing recovery as a concern.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Alina Dizik  </div><div>1074 words</div><div>22 August 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To get top dollar for his Portland, Ore., home, Alex Hickman played lowball. He set his asking price below that of comparable homes nearby -- and got six offers in four days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We strategically listed it under market and tried to create kind of a frenzy," says Mr. Hickman, a 26-year-old credit union examiner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hickman purchased the home in 2005 for $325,000 and listed it for $497,000. He says a $505,000 asking price would have been more reflective of the market, especially since the property's first-floor apartment could generate rental income. Mr. Hickman had also finished the basement of the home, which is in desirable Southeast Portland, an older neighborhood with few new construction projects. So his go-low pricing strategy was a gamble, one his real-estate agent initially counseled against.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It creates a havoc that doesn't serve anyone well," says Rebecca Walter, Mr. Hickman's agent at Redfin. A low asking price doesn't necessarily increase what buyers offer, she says, since they are more willing to compete on other terms of the contract, such as paying all cash for the purchase or waiving the inspection to speed the sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In residential real estate, the asking price is often as much about psychology as it is reality. Michael Seiler, professor of real estate and finance at the <span class="companylink">College of William &amp; Mary</span> in Williamsburg, Va., said that most home buyers don't realize that setting an asking price is primarily a negotiating tactic. "When you set a list price, you're sending a signal to the market," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike McCann, a real-estate agent with <span class="companylink">Berkshire Hathaway</span> HomeServices, Fox &amp; Roach in Philadelphia, says pricing can be "a delicate balance." Most sellers overestimate the worth of their home, he says, and some agents will start with a too-high price to avoid hard feelings. Others agents may start high just to get the seller's business or, conversely, they'll price too low for a quick sale and commission, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most agents say that getting sellers to start with a realistic asking price is one of their biggest challenges. Steve Beckman spent $150,000 on renovations to his 100-year-old farmhouse in Ojai, Calif., which he purchased for $325,000. When selling five years later, Mr. Beckman, a 61-year-old retired landscape designer, asked $500,000 -- with both financial and emotional factors coming into play. It sat on the market for almost 1 1/2 years, eventually selling for $242,000, far less than he and his wife, Mary, had wanted. "We didn't even get a nibble at the asking price," says Mr. Beckman. "Nobody cares what you paid for it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Large gaps between the asking and sale price are somewhat uncommon, says Stan Humphries, chief economist at real-estate website Zillow. In May, median sale prices were only 3% lower than asking prices in 35 metro areas across the U.S., according to a Zillow analysis. Separately, real-estate agents surveyed by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said that only 3% of homes sold for less than 23% below the asking price in 2013; and only 2% of homes sold at 12% or more above asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes without comparable sales data often see the widest price gaps, says Prof. Seiler. If the property has historic value, for example, is set on a unique plot of land or has a one-of-a-kind design, it can be more difficult to price. Without comparables, "an appraiser will have no clue what a property is worth and a buyer wouldn't know either," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comparable prices become less relevant when inventory in a desirable neighborhood is unusually low. "This creates a real feeding frenzy for real estate," Mr. Humphries says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one claims to fully understand the psychology of pricing. But some common practices have emerged. For example, research has found that an exact asking price, such as $795,475, often indicates that the price is less negotiable than a round number, such as $800,000, Prof. Seiler says. "Those using precise pricing show confidence in the price," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additionally, pricing at $999,900 rather than $1 million influences buying decisions on a subconscious level. The home "seems way cheaper," according to Prof. Seiler. And even when a home sells above asking price, the initial lower asking price can make buyers feel like they are getting a great deal. "The goal is to make it stick in your head that you're getting a bargain," he says. "It's the way our brain looks at numbers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developer Sebastian Rein took that approach when he priced a home in the Mar Vista neighborhood of Los Angeles at $2.995 million -- just $5,000 less than the intended $3 million price tag. The strategy got the property "a wider audience," he says. The 4,400-square-foot home sold within a week at $3.1 million. "When you come to market, you have a month or six weeks before it starts to fade in people's minds," said Mr. Rein, who listed the property with L.A.-based Partners Trust. "There's a velocity you have to achieve when you come to market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, unplanned events can sometimes trump price. This January, Karen and Curtis Spillers put their five-bedroom, 1910 home in Wilmette, Ill., on the market for $835,000, a price they considered aligned with the market. Then, a winter storm dumped close to a foot of snow on the ground during the open house. Despite the weather, over 100 people showed up, says Ms. Spillers, 53, a technology public-relations executive who bought the home almost 25 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within 24 hours, the couple had five offers, eventually accepting a $900,000 bid. They credit the timing: Coming on the market in January meant there was only one other home for sale in their Chicago suburb, which has highly rated schools. The couple, now living in St. Louis, didn't expect to get a premium on their asking price. "We couldn't have been happier with the results," she said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Lauren Schuker Blum </div><div>1338 words</div><div>21 August 2014</div><div>08:24</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allison and Craig Knizekstruggled for 10 years over how to expand their 2,650-square-foot home in Sherman Oaks, Calif. Then they found the solution: Rather than increase the footprint of their existing home, they decided to build another one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Knizeks finished construction last year. Built for $300,000, their 789-square-foot guesthouse has an A-frame structure with an 18-foot ceiling in the living room and bi-fold doors that open onto a fire pit and a pool. This guesthouse isn't just for guests, though: The couple and their children often occupy the space themselves, using it both as an office and for entertaining. They often find themselves fighting over it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We realized that we all needed a place to escape to, but we couldn't figure out how to create that space in our main house," says Ms. Knizek, an architectural designer. "Building a second structure was so much less expensive than having to incorporate a big addition into our main house."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the province of the ultrarich, who had endless acres of land on which to build and many visitors to house, the guesthouse is enjoying a moment with owners of (slightly) more modest means. "Before, you might see a builder of a $10 million house include a guest home in the project," says Ms. Knizek, who has remodeled guesthouses for clients. "Now, a lot of homes priced in the $3 million to $5 million range have guesthouses too."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tami Pardee, a real-estate agent in Venice, Calif., says that about two years ago, she was seeing developers build homes with guesthouses instead of duplexes designed for two families. Guesthouses are even appearing in densely populated Manhattan, though instead of offering two homes on the same lot, developers pitch two apartments in the same building. At Walker Tower, a condominium building in Chelsea, real-estate firm <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> is marketing a 6,738-square-foot full-floor penthouse with a 1,356-square-foot "guesthouse unit" on a lower floor, for a combined price of $51.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We kept hearing people say they loved the full-floor penthouse, but wouldn't it be great if it came with a separate guest unit for friends, a home office or a nanny," says Vickey Barron, Walker Tower's director of sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exact statistics on guesthouses are hard to come by, which also helps explain their popularity. Unlike most primary homes, many guesthouses are built without a permit, making them more difficult to keep track of and easier to erect. Adding on to a main house without a permit could complicate any eventual sale. A guesthouse built without a permit would have to be disclosed as such to prospective buyers, but it could also be easily torn down in a worst-case scenario—something that isn't usually an option with a primary home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And as the type of owners who build guesthouses change, so does the way guesthouses are used. These days, they often do everything besides housing guests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes, they are home offices. The number of Americans working from home at least part of the time soared more than 45% from 1997 to 2010, according to a recent Census Bureau report. Sometimes, they're for Junior: One in five people in their 20s and early 30s live with their parents now, compared with one in 10 a generation ago, according to the Census. Guesthouses offer a less infantilizing option than the childhood bedroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reacting to consumer demand, the New Home Co., a home builder in Irvine, Calif., started making detached guesthouses a significant part of its developments about two years ago. At the developer's newest Irvine property, the Amelia and Trevi neighborhoods in Orchard Hills, homeowners have the option to add a 500- to 700-square-foot guesthouse to their property for about $200,000. The main homes range in cost from $1.7 million to $2.8 million. "People want a place for their parents or college-age children to stay," says Joan Marcus-Colvin, who runs sales and marketing for the New Home Co.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there is the recent run-up of the rental market. Rents are rising in major metropolitan areas across the country, making leasing out a guesthouse a tempting option. Guesthouse owners and real-estate agents say the emergence of online lodging sites, such as VRBO and <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span>, has also made it easier to turn a guesthouse into a source of extra income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Constantine Vlahos, a former day trader, now makes extra income renting out his guesthouse in Los Angeles. Mr. Vlahos bought a Mediterranean Revival-style main residence in 2000 for just over $1 million and spent $2.5 million—and five years—renovating it, adding a 750-square-foot guesthouse with a 35-foot pool and gardens. The guesthouse has floor-to-ceiling glass doors, marble and stone floors, views of downtown as well as a big stone fireplace, kitchenette and king-size bed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, Mr. Vlahos began renting out the guesthouse, and since then he says he's hosted dozens of marriage proposals and elopements and many celebrities. He says the guesthouse is occupied about 80% of the time at a cost of $395 a night, nearly 50% more than when he first started renting it six years ago. A month-long stay costs $9,480.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Natasha Nekrasova, a 38-year-old lawyer, paid just under $3 million for a modern, glass-walled, 2,500-square-foot home in Venice, Calif., earlier this year. She says one of the big incentives to buy the property was its 1,000-square-foot, two-story guesthouse, with exposed steel beams and French oak floors. "We bought the house for the guesthouse specifically, because we knew we could rent it out on Airbnb," she says, adding that she doesn't mind sharing space with strangers because the guesthouse is separate, with its own kitchen and parking area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agents say guesthouses, even unpermitted ones, can significantly increase the value of a property. "Adding a guesthouse is a great way to differentiate a property, and it can often add 20% to the value of a home," says Jason Rodriguez, a builder of high-end properties in Los Angeles. He says that owners always recoup construction costs when they sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some guesthouses are being used as homes away from home. Rochelle Gerson, a 53-year-old business-affairs executive at HBO, and her husband several years ago spent about $250,000 to renovate the 600-square-foot guesthouse on their 1-acre property in Encino, Calif., and to build a pool. Now Asian-inspired with a beach feel, the guesthouse has blue slate floors, vaulted white ceilings and skylights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Gerson, whose 18-year-old daughter has special needs, says her guesthouse has become a place for the entire family to "staycation." "My daughter's autism doesn't allow us to travel a lot," she says. "On weekends, I'll go up there and pretend I am on vacation. It's like staying at a hotel, but you never have to leave your house."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are homeowners who are still using their guesthouses for their guests. Valerie Giraud's 2,400-square-foot guesthouse, which has French doors, a stone exterior and a large porch, sits about 70 feet from her 5,000-square-foot main residence on a cliff overlooking the ocean in Malibu. She says friends or artists often stay in the space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Giraud says she toyed with renting out her space a few months ago. "I put a listing and some photos of the guesthouse up on Airbnb and asked for $250 a night," she says, "and within an hour I had three requests, including one person who wanted to stay the following night. I totally freaked out and immediately took down the posting."</p>

Despite the weather, over 100 people showed up, says Ms. Spillers, 53, a technology public-relations executive who bought the home almost 25 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within 24 hours, the couple had five offers, eventually accepting a $900,000 bid. They credit the timing: Coming on the market in January meant there was only one other home for sale in their Chicago suburb, which has highly rated schools. The couple, now living in St. Louis, didn't expect to get a premium on their asking price. "We couldn't have been happier with the results," she said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gold fell to a two-month low on Thursday as stronger U.S. economic data intensified investor worries about higher interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gold for December delivery, the most active contract, fell $19.80, or 1.5%, to settle at $1,275.40 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the <span class="companylink">New York Mercantile Exchange</span>. This was the lowest settlement since June 18.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, separate reports showed an expansion in U.S. factory activity at the fastest rate in more than four years, a rise in existing home sales and a decline in claims for jobless benefits, a measure of layoffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many gold traders worry that the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> will move to raise interest rates sooner than expected if the economy continues to strengthen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These fears were reinforced on Wednesday, when minutes from the Fed's July policy-setting meeting showed officials debated the possibility of raising rates sooner, but opted to wait for further evidence of economic health.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the broader investment community has expected the Fed to tighten monetary policy as the economy improved, "we might be seeing the second shoe drop," said James Steel, a precious metals analyst with <span class="companylink">HSBC</span> in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shift in outlook is bearish for gold, which yields nothing and struggles to compete with <span class="companylink">Treasury</span> bonds and other interest-bearing investments when rates climb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The higher potential for a rising interest rate environment continues to be barrier for gold," said Dave Meger, director of metals trading with Vision Financial Markets in Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gold traders are looking ahead to a speech from Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen at an annual gathering of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyo., Friday. European Bank President Mario Draghi will also speak at the event. </p>

</div><div class="author">By Ben Leubsdorf and Nick Timiraos </div><div>464 words</div><div>21 August 2014</div><div>08:47</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing recovery gained traction in July as sales of previously owned homes rose to their highest level in 10 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes increased 2.4% from June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.15 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Thursday. July sales were down 4.3% from a year earlier, when sales peaked for 2013 before a jump in mortgage rates threw the housing recovery off track. July was the fourth consecutive month sales rose from the prior month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not only were sales last month at their highest level since last September, but fewer transactions came from short sales of underwater homes and foreclosures. Distressed sales accounted for 9% of all sales in July, the lowest level since the trade group's tally began in October 2008 at the peak of the financial crisis. More than a third of all sales in 2009 were distressed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of existing homes available for sale in July was up 5.8% from a year earlier to 2.37 million, its highest level in nearly two years. "More inventory, in my view, will mean more home sales," said Lawrence Yun, the NAR's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, rising inventories are creating more competition for sellers, which helps explain why prices are rising more slowly than last year. The median sales price in July was up 4.9% from a year earlier, compared with a 13.1% gain in July 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upshot is that the housing market has grown more balanced between buyers and sellers. At the current pace of sales, it would take 5½ months to exhaust the supply of homes for sale, up from 5 months last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes account for roughly 90% of U.S. home-buying activity. The Commerce Department will report new-home sales for July on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market has started to heal in recent years. But sales tumbled last summer as the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> prepared to begin winding down its bond-buying stimulus program and mortgage rates jumped from historically low levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales bottomed out in March and have since risen. Still, the Fed has continued to flag the sluggish housing recovery as a concern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A stronger labor market should help support the nation's housing market. U.S. employers have ramped up hiring in recent months and new applications for unemployment benefits fell last week to a seasonally adjusted 298,000, a level last regularly seen in 2006, the <span class="companylink">Labor Department</span> said Thursday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks rose, extending a recent bounce, with help from good news on housing including strong earnings from <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 80.85 points, or 0.48%, to 16919.59. The S&amp;P 500 index added 9.86 points, or 0.5%, to 1981.60. For both the <span class="companylink">Dow</span> and the <span class="companylink">S&amp;P</span>, the gains marked the sixth day in the plus column out of the last eight sessions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 19.2 points, or 0.43%, to 4527.51.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks ground higher through most of the session. The market got a boost from data showing housing starts hit their highest level since November. Starts rose 15.7% in July, to an annual rate of 1.093 million units, well north of the 961,000 units expected by economists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also before the opening bell, <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> reported better-than-expected sales and profit in the second quarter. The home-improvement retailer also lifted its earnings guidance for the year, pushing shares up $4.64, or 5.6%, to $88.23. <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> shares paced gainers in the <span class="companylink">Dow</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of home builders rose. The SPDR Homebuilder ETF was up 2% and the <span class="companylink">iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF</span> gained 2.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Housing is an absolute must in terms of . . . long-term economic growth in the U.S.," said Natalie Trunow, chief investment officer of equities at <span class="companylink">Calvert Investments</span>, which has about $13 billion under management. The report on housing starts is "a positive sign for the home-builder sector," she said, adding that she is looking to increase her position in stocks of home builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Composite trading volume was just 4.8 billion shares, making it the third-slowest full trading day of the year. "It is a quiet summer afternoon," said Darren Wolfberg, head of U.S. cash equity trading at <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span>, adding that lower volume could have exaggerated the move higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday's gains marked a continued rebound in stocks from a selloff that began in mid-July, as geopolitical pressure collided with concerns about an eventual tightening of the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s monetary policy. But many investors say that stocks are likely to continue to rally, boosted by low interest rates, corporate profits and improving economic data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The late July and early August correction wasn't severe at all on a global basis, but it was really widespread across asset classes," said Steven Wieting, global chief investment strategist at Citi Private Bank. "That fact has made me feel a lot more comfortable with stocks," he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, other investors have tempered their optimism in the wake of the recent swoon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move higher in both stocks and Treasurys this month "leads me to question which market is right," said Anwiti Bahuguna, a senior portfolio manager at <span class="companylink">Columbia Management</span></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's no fundamental reason to think equities are in trouble," Ms. Bahuguna said. "It's really the fact that perhaps at this point they're fully valuing the economic improvement and the bond market is signaling caution to us."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The yield on the 10-year <span class="companylink">Treasury</span> note rose to 2.405%. Yields move inversely with prices.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home building has come in from the cold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders broke ground on 101,000 new projects in July, for a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.093 million units, according to the Commerce Department. That is a 16% improvement over June's housing starts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those impressive numbers indicate the housing recovery still is on solid ground. That was thrown into doubt earlier this year by a plunge in housing starts. The decline took January's starts down to where they were a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was a break from the recovery's pattern in which each year's midwinter lows were significantly higher than the previous year's. The fear was that we may have come to the end of the herky-jerky upward housing market cycle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the fact that July saw more new home starts than June and May suggests the plunge wasn't the end of the recovery cycle but the result of the harsh winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the end of the recession in 2009, July's starts have never before been higher than both May and June's. The typical pattern is a rise from the winter low throughout spring, a peak in May or June, and then a decline or plateau for the dog days of summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The likely explanation is found in the past winter's severe weather. That appears to have suppressed home building, along with other economic activity, but only temporarily. Some of that building got pushed back to later in the year, so the appearance of winter's missing starts pumped up July to the highest level since the summer of 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So despite starting from a very low level of activity, 9.1% more homes have been built in this year's first seven months than in the same period last year. The housing recovery has shaken off the winter chill.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kris Hudson   </div><div>733 words</div><div>20 August 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two-year trend of big, new houses getting even bigger appears to have peaked -- at least for now -- as more buyers seeking modest homes enter the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median size of U.S. homes on which builders started construction in the second quarter registered 2,478 square feet, unchanged from the first quarter but still close to the all-time high of 2,491 set in last year's third quarter, according to Commerce Department data released Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median new-home sizes generally have increased since 2012 as the market -- substantially diminished in the wake of the housing crash -- has been dominated by better-heeled, move-up buyers with the capital and credit to buy larger houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Entry-level and first-time buyers, who tend to buy smaller homes, have largely remained sidelined due to strict mortgage-qualification standards and tepid wage and job growth. The <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> forecasts that first-time buyers will account for 16% of new-home sales this year, down from 25% to 28% between 2001 and 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet executives at builders <span class="companylink">KB Home</span>, <span class="companylink">PulteGroup Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Century Communities Inc</span>. report that they are seeing early signs of entry-level buyers returning to the market as mortgage standards ease slightly and job gains take hold. Sales of Pulte's entry-level <span class="companylink">Centex</span> homes, priced at an average of $202,000, increased by 26% in the second quarter from a year earlier on a per-community basis, and by 29% in the first.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The expectation will be, whenever we see an increase in first-time buyers, that will put downward pressure on the trend" of new-home sizes, said Robert Dietz, an economist with the home-builders group. "Then it will be a question of whether we'll see some actual decreases in the median as the market mix [of buyers] changes over the next two years."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other figures indicate that new-home sizes are nearing a peak. Mr. Dietz calculates home size on a four-quarter moving average, finding that the median for the past four quarters is 2,478 square feet, essentially unchanged from 2,470 in the four quarters that ended in this year's first. Meanwhile, Commerce data show that the average size of a newly built home in the second quarter, which is typically more volatile, declined by 2.7% to 2,653 square feet from the all-time high set in the first quarter of 2,727.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Miami builder Fernando Martinez moved his construction activity this summer to the far-flung suburb of Homestead from towns closer to the city, in order to target entry-level buyers and capitalize on cheaper land prices. He intends to start construction this month in Homestead of 15 homes averaging 2,100 square feet at roughly $200,000 apiece.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're starting [construction of] homes because we already have them sold," Mr. Martinez said. "I believe it's [buyer confidence] and affordability. Homestead is probably the only area left in Miami-Dade County where you can buy a house for under $200,000."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, economists and builders don't predict that median new-home sizes will drop sharply. That is mainly because the return of entry-level buyers is expected to be gradual as move-up buyers continue to account for the majority of sales in the next year or two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a regional basis, declines in the median size of new homes in the Northeast and Midwest in the second quarter from the first were offset by increases in the South and West, where more homes are built. The median size of new homes in the Northeast declined by 6.3% from the first quarter to 2,374 square feet in the second. The Midwest declined by 13.6% to 2,354. The South increased by 1.4% to 2,502. The West increased by 1.9% to 2,477.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, housing starts climbed almost 16% last month to an annual rate of nearly 1.1 million units, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. That marked the highest level of construction since November, driven by a pronounced rise in new apartments. Applications for building permits, a construction bellwether, rose 8.1% to a 1.05 million rate.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. stocks ended higher Tuesday after positive economic data and strong earnings results from <span class="companylink">Home Depot Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">TJX Cos</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 80.85 points, or 0.48%, to 16919.59. The S&amp;P 500 index added 9.86 points, or 0.5%, to 1981.60, and the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> Composite Index gained 19.20 points, or 0.43%, to 4527.51.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks were bolstered by data on the housing market and consumer prices. Composite trading volume was just 4.8 billion shares, making it the third-slowest full trading day of the year.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data Tuesday showed housing starts jumped 15.7% in July from a month earlier to an annual rate of 1.093 million units, marking the highest level of construction since November. Economists had expected housing starts to rise to an annual rate of 961,000 units. Separately, consumer prices rose 0.1% in July from a month earlier, in line with expectations. The advance in consumer prices was the slowest since February, which could give the Federal Reserve room to keep monetary policy loose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Housing is an absolute must in terms of...long-term economic growth in the U.S.," said Natalie Trunow, chief investment officer of equities at <span class="companylink">Calvert Investments</span>, which has about $13 billion under management.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, not all investors are looking to add to their stock positions after upbeat economic data. Simultaneous gains in stocks and bonds this month have made Anwiti Bahuguna, a senior portfolio manager at <span class="companylink">Columbia Management</span>, cautious about the outlook for stocks for the first time this year. "It leads me to question which market is right," she said. Columbia Management oversees $363 billion.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The British pound fell against the dollar, buying $1.6620, after data showed U.K. inflation slowed more than expected in July, which could ease pressure on the <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span> to raise interest rates.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar rose against the euro and yen on Tuesday after strong U.S. housing-starts numbers for July trumped a small gain in consumer prices over the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro fell as low as $1.3313, its weakest level since Nov. 7, 2013. In late afternoon trade, the euro was down 0.3% at $1.3320. The dollar rose 0.3% versus the yen to ¥102.89, its highest level in two weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. housing starts rose 15.7% last month from June to an annual rate of 1.093 million units, the Commerce Department said, signifying the highest level of construction since November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the consumer-price index, an inflation gauge, increased 0.1% last month from June, in line with forecasts. The "core" index, which removes food and energy categories, also rose 0.1% over the period, against expectations for a 0.2% increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> follows both inflation and home building closely, and the data for the housing market surprised investors more, said Vassili Serebriakov, currency strategist at <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decent U.S. economic numbers on the day contrasted with data arriving earlier across Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The British pound weakened after U.K. consumer prices for July came in lower than expected, relieving pressure on the <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span> to raise interest rates ahead of market expectations. In addition, the euro zone's monthly current account surplus, one of the pillars that had been propping up the single currency, shrank slightly in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Signs of improving U.S. fundamentals were at the heart of the dollar's move," said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at <span class="companylink">Western Union</span>. "We saw a strong U.S. and a struggling Europe. That the current account surplus has eroded more than expected, that's diminished one of the few positives that remain for the euro."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors are looking ahead to events involving the Federal Reserve later this week, which include the minutes from the most recent Federal Open Market Committee meeting, and the Jackson Hole gathering of global central bankers, where Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen will speak Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market will follow both events closely to look for signs that the central bank is shifting its thinking about the U.S. economy, and when it will raise interest rates. Higher interest rates would benefit the dollar, as investors would receive greater returns from dollar-denominated assets.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos   </div><div>907 words</div><div>19 August 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To understand why the U.S. housing market this year isn't providing the lift many economists expected, look to Phoenix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the cities most battered by the 2006 bust, Phoenix was the first to snap back in 2011. Prices, off by 56% from peak, then rebounded sharply, trimming that drop by a third. The number of homes in some stage of foreclosure has fallen to about 4,300 today from more than 50,000 four years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, prices and sales are cooling off. Inventories of homes listed for sale have climbed to their highest level in three years while the number of houses sold in June fell 12% from a year earlier. The rebound during the past two years "gave people a false sense of how quick we would recover," said Jim Belfiore, who runs a local home-builder consulting firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales in other once-hot markets also are slowing. Inventories in Washington, D.C., rose by a third in July from a year earlier, while sales were down 8%. Listings in Sacramento were up 44%, as sales dropped 11%. In Las Vegas, sales slid 10% while the number of listings without offers rose 53%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists predicted double-digit gains in home sales nationally this year would help spur economic growth, but sales are down more than 5% over last year. "There appears to be a conservatism among consumers and their willingness to take on big-ticket purchases," said Doug Duncan, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, whose view of the housing market has deteriorated recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a report Monday, Fannie cut its national housing forecasts for this year and next. It now expects new-home sales of 431,000 this year, which would represent a gain of 0.6% from last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the foreclosure boom that fueled much of the recovery fades, income and population growth are reasserting themselves as drivers of the housing market in places such as Phoenix. Meanwhile, lingering scars from the bust are playing out as some of the country's hottest housing markets struggle to pass the baton from bargain-hunting investors, who typically pay cash, to traditional buyers with mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news in Phoenix, as across much of the country, is that the foreclosure crisis has largely faded. That drop-off was a big driver behind the surge in prices as more buyers, especially investors, chased fewer homes. Rising prices now have led homeowners to test the market and investors to retreat, a trend playing out nationally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are up nearly 46% from the 2011 low. Investors accounted for nearly 15% of homes bought in June, down from about one-quarter last year and one-third of sales in June 2012, according to Mike Orr of <span class="companylink">Arizona State University</span>'s W.P. Carey School of Business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Phoenix, slow job and income growth are among the reasons builders aren't benefiting from the drop-off in foreclosures, especially as investors and foreign buyers have pulled back. Employment in Phoenix, after expanding at an average annual pace of 2.6% and 2.8% in each of the last two years, is up just 1.5% so far this year, state figures show. "If people don't have jobs, they're not buying homes," said Greg Markov, a local real-estate agent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sluggish local economy is compounded by consumers still too battered from the bust to think about getting a loan. Some don't have sufficient equity to turn a house sale into an adequate down payment on their next purchase. Others suffered credit blemishes or income hits that make banks reluctant to lend. "It is taking longer for folks who went through the downturn to re-emerge," Mr. Belfiore said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David O'Hagan needed three months and two price reductions to find a buyer for his five-bedroom home in the Phoenix suburb of Peoria. The sale is set to close this week for about 5% less than the $259,000 he initially asked, though in four years he will have turned a sizable profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I had hoped to see more traffic. It was a little disappointing," said Mr. O'Hagan, who is a transportation manager for a food company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix stands in contrast to other cities such as Houston, Dallas and San Francisco, where better job growth is fueling stronger demand. Mr. O'Hagan, 39 years old, recently sold a separate rental home in a Dallas suburb in just days after 65 buyers showed an interest. It was "a complete polar opposite" from Phoenix, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders, who paid premiums to buy land last year in anticipation of a rebound, have raised sales prices aggressively. "Maybe a little too much," said Michael IlesCremieux, vice president of land acquisitions at Scottsdale-based <span class="companylink">Meritage Homes Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some early investors, meanwhile, are cashing out. Jon Mirmelli, a real-estate agent, last year sold seven homes he had acquired since 2010 as rentals. He is now selling two dozen more homes for a national investor that he declined to name.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he doesn't see a big risk of further price declines because other investors are still combing the desert for deals. The discounts of years past are "something I'm not going to see again in my lifetime," he said. "We have a normal market again."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TOKYO -- A New York-based real-estate brokerage said it expects growth in Asia, despite challenges such as instability in China's property market and the rise of e-commerce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carlo Barel di Sant'Albano, international chief executive of <span class="companylink">Cushman &amp; Wakefield Inc</span>., said he wanted to double Asian-Pacific revenue in the next three to five years. In 2013, the firm generated $192 million of revenue in the region, roughly 8% of its global total.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the company was looking for opportunities to acquire smaller real-estate firms to take advantage of the region's expected economic expansion. Asia's biggest economies, with the exception of Japan, are forecast to grow faster than the U.S., the U.K. or the euro zone in the coming years, according to projections by the <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is a tremendous amount of activity, and it will continue. It will continue because capital is flowing very quickly -- East to West, West to East," Mr. Sant'Albano said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among its activities in recent months, Cushman &amp; Wakefield helped the State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan acquire a prime office complex in Seoul for $447 million. Last year, the firm helped <span class="companylink">Mitsubishi Estate Co</span>. sell the property that houses the <span class="companylink">London Stock Exchange</span> to <span class="companylink">Oxford Properties</span> for GBP 235 million ($392 million).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cushman &amp; Wakefield's main business is leasing. It generates fees working for building owners or tenants. In Japan, by contrast, asset management is a primary business. The company purchases and manages properties with money from investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With two local partners, Cushman &amp; Wakefield's asset-management unit in Japan runs a real-estate investment trust called <span class="companylink">Nippon REIT Investment Corp</span>. It was listed on the <span class="companylink">Tokyo Stock Exchange</span> in April. The REIT has invested in office buildings in Tokyo and residential properties in major Japanese cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, Cushman &amp; Wakefield acquired a Singapore-based firm last year that offers interior design, project management and construction services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some investors see vulnerabilities in Asian property markets, particularly in China. Beijing has sought to curb overheating, although recently some cities have been relaxing restrictions to address a housing-market slump. Chinese consumers accustomed to steady rises in the value of their property might pull back on spending because a high percentage of household wealth is tied to real estate in China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for Japan, he said the nation's economic recovery would attract more people and investment from abroad in the years leading up to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, even though the growth rate might be slower than elsewhere in Asia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The emergence of e-commerce led by companies such as China's <span class="companylink">Alibaba Group Holding Ltd</span>. and Japan's <span class="companylink">Rakuten Inc</span>. is reshaping the property business because more purchases are done online, cutting floor demand from some retailers while increasing the need for data centers and distribution facilities.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rachel 'Bunny' Mellon's Virginia Estate to List for $70 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oak Spring Farm, the roughly 2,000-acre Virginia estate of late heiress Rachel "Bunny" Mellon, will list for $70 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Located in Upperville, Va., about an hour from Washington., D.C., the estate has about 40 structures on it, including a roughly 10,000-square-foot Georgian mansion known as the "Brick House," a pool house designed by architect I.M. Pei, a private mile-long airstrip and a working dairy. The Mellons also bred racehorses at Oak Spring Farm, which has extensive equestrian stables, paddocks and barns, said listing broker Thomas B. Anderson of <span class="companylink">Washington Fine Properties</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Mellon's primary residence isn't included in the sale; it will be given along with a 100-acre portion of the estate to the Gerard B. Lambert Foundation, a charitable entity established by Ms. Mellon in memory of her father.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Mellon died in March at age 103. She was the wife of the late Paul Mellon, son of financier Andrew Mellon. A well-known horticulturalist, Ms. Mellon refurbished the White House Rose Garden during the Kennedy administration and coordinated the flowers for President Kennedy's funeral cortege and the landscaping at his memorial in Arlington National Cemetery. The couple was also known for amassing one of the nation's most notable art collections, much of which they donated to the <span class="companylink">National Gallery of Art in Washington</span> and other institutions. Mr. Mellon was also a fox hunter and horse breeder, with a 1993 Kentucky Derby winner, Sea Hero, to his credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Alex Forger, a family friend and an executor of Ms. Mellon's estate, Oak Spring Farm was the Mellons' home base. He added that Jacqueline Kennedy, a close friend of Ms. Mellon's, was a frequent guest at the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mellon acquired the farm in the 1930s from his mother, then added acreage to it, Mr. Forger said. He built "Brick House" in the early 1940s with his first wife. She died in 1946, and two years later he married Bunny, an heiress to the Listerine mouthwash fortune. The newlyweds built a new, smaller house on the property, and Mr. Mellon used the Brick House as an office and a place to store and display the couple's art collection. Surrounded by other small brick buildings, including a garage and a clock tower, the area around the Brick House feels like "its own little village," Mr. Forger said, noting that a new owner would likely want to make some renovations to the Brick House to return it to residential use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are about 20 other residential structures on the property, including a house where the Mellons' daughter lived, guesthouses and homes for staff, Mr. Forger said. There are also stables and barns, extensive gardens and greenhouses and other outbuildings. Mr. Forger said the family and community are hoping that the property will be purchased by an individual who will keep it intact rather than subdividing it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A portion of Ms. Mellon's Cape Cod estate sold for $19.5 million in 2013, after being listed for $28.7 million. Her 27-acre Antigua property is also for sale, listed with Christie's International Real Estate for $11.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One Beer Dispenser, 15 Televisions: Jimmy Kimmel's L.A. Home For Sale</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From 1999 to 2003, comedian Jimmy Kimmel co-hosted <span class="companylink">Comedy Central</span>'s testosterone-fueled "The Man Show" with a beer in hand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So it is appropriate that the roughly 3,600-square-foot, five-bedroom Los Angeles home he purchased during the show's run has a built-in beer dispenser in the yard. The house, in the Hollywood Hills, is now slated to go on the market for $2.299 million with Karen Misraje of Partners Trust Real Estate Brokerage and Acquisitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kimmel is now host of the late-night talk show "Jimmy Kimmel Live," and the home has other touches reflecting its owner's hobbies. There are about 15 televisions throughout the house, Ms. Misraje said -- in the kitchen there are five. One of the bedrooms also doubles as a recording studio with a sound booth. A built-in dining table that seats up to 12 people can be lowered electronically to become a coffee table. There's a swimming pool and hot tub, and the yard boasts four separate areas for dining. In the outdoor kitchen, there is a pizza oven, a smoker and a barbecue in addition to the beer dispenser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's an entertainer's heaven," Ms. Misraje said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kimmel bought the house in 2002, paying $925,009, according to public records. But he moved out in 2009 and has since been renting it out, Ms. Misraje said. He now has another home in Los Angeles, she said. Mr. Kimmel couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Built in the mid-1940s, the two-story Hollywood Regency-style house has a number of its original details, such as a wrought-iron banister and leaded-glass windows, Ms. Misraje said, though Mr. Kimmel extensively renovated it. She said Mr. Kimmel, who enjoys cooking, paid particular attention to the kitchen, which has double ovens, a soda dispenser and a dessert refrigerator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colorado Lakefront Home with Dressage Ring Asks $27.7 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A roughly 122-acre estate in the Denver area with an English manor-style home and dressage ring is on the market for $27.7 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Located in Lakewood, Colo., about 20 minutes from downtown Denver, the property is the highest-priced home on the market in the area, according to co-listing agent Nancy Wolfe of Fuller Sotheby's International Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Built in the 1930s, the brick house is about 14,000 square feet, with 11 bedrooms and nine bathrooms, Ms. Wolfe said. With a clay tile roof and copper gutters, the house has unobstructed mountain views. The property sits on Ward Lake, where there is a beach and a blue-shuttered boathouse with a fireplace, also built in the 1930s. The gated estate also has a swimming pool, tennis court, three staff cottages, two barns and a fishing pond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The estate was home to the late Vernon F. Taylor Jr., former president of Westhoma Oil, and his wife Ann Bonfoey Taylor, a clothing designer who was admired for her style and appeared in magazines like Harper's Bazaar and Vogue. Known for entertaining, the Taylors were friends with Prince Philip and Princess Anne of Great Britain and had them as guests at the home, according to their son, Vernon F. Taylor III, who said he recalls having lunch with Princess Anne. In 1997, they hosted a dinner for the spouses of the world leaders in town for the Denver Summit of the Eight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When somebody really important came into town, it was a place that was invariably chosen to entertain them," the younger Mr. Taylor said. Ms. Taylor died in 2007, and her husband last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Wolfe is listing the property with Fred Wolfe of Fuller Sotheby's International Realty and Tye Stockton of Ascent Sotheby's International Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Model Christie Brinkley Cuts the Price on</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Turks and Caicos Home 16% to $9 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christie Brinkley has lowered the price of her home in the Turks and Caicos Islands to $9 million, according to agents marketing the property. The house first went on the market in late 2013 for $10.75 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Known as "Lucky House," the three-bedroom beachfront house is located within the Parrot Cay by COMO luxury resort, a roughly 1,000-acre private island. Homeowners have access to resort amenities, such as room service, housekeeping, yoga, diving and spa services. Other owners there include Bruce Willis and Donna Karan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property is being marketed by Nina Siegenthaler of Turks &amp; Caicos Sotheby's International Realty and Walter Zephirin of 7th Heaven Properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separated from the hotel by a spit of land, the house is about 3,400 square feet and sits on 1.6 acres with about 200 feet of beach front, said Ms. Siegenthaler. It has three bedrooms and 3 1/2 bathrooms, and each bedroom has indoor and outdoor showers and a screened-in terrace. Outside, there is a veranda with a 45-foot long infinity edge pool. The house is being sold fully furnished. There is also a separate butler's entrance and a two-bedroom, one-bathroom staff cottage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Brinkley bought the house newly built in the early 2000s, Mr. Zephirin said, but in recent years has been renting it out at prices that range from $4,000 to $8,000 per night, depending on the season. Through a spokesperson, Ms. Brinkley said she is selling because she wants to do some "adventure traveling" for the next few years. Ms. Brinkley also has a number of other homes, including a roughly 22-acre estate in Bridgehampton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Turks and Caicos has grown as a resort destination in recent years, Mr. Zephirin said, and as a result home prices there have "consistently gone up." Since the 2008 financial crisis, "Turks has really rebounded significantly," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Washington Camped Here: Pennsylvania Estate -- and Former</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revolutionary War Campground -- Goes on the Market for $14 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 9-acre Pennsylvania property where George Washington and his troops are said to have camped during the Revolutionary War is available for sale for $14 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property is located on Lewis Lane in Whitpain Township, about 25 minutes outside of Philadelphia. It includes a six-bedroom, five-bathroom house built in 1913 but extensively renovated and restored, according to owner Steven Korman, founder of Korman Communities, a Pennsylvania-based developer of hotels and apartments. Mr. Korman said he added about 9,000 square feet to the original 5,000-square-foot house, incorporating a century-old stone wall that had been in the garden and adding modern touches like a movie theater, gym, wine cellar, saltwater pool and elevator. Between buying the house and the renovation, he said he spent about $13 million. The house is being sold fully furnished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Washington's troops camped in the Lewis Lane area in 1777 after the Battle of Germantown, on their way to Valley Forge, according to Marie Goldkamp, president of the Historical Society of Whitpain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A self-described "history buff," Mr. Korman said the history of the property, which had been owned by the same family from the 1700s until Mr. Korman bought it more than four years ago, was "a huge thing for me." He added that one room in the house displays his collection of letters written by U.S. presidents, including Washington, Lincoln and Jefferson. These aren't included in the sale price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Korman said he's selling because he's getting divorced, and he hopes the sale "will be cathartic." A licensed real-estate broker, Mr. Korman is listing the property himself.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto   </div><div>341 words</div><div>14 August 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A17</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York's construction spending is booming, with the total dollars poured into development in the city expected to rise to $31.5 billion in 2014, according to a report released Wednesday by the <span class="companylink">New York Building Congress</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid a lackluster number of permits issued in recent years, developers are spending more to build fewer units, underscoring the challenge faced by Mayor Bill de Blasio as he pushes for more affordable housing. Construction spending totaled $28.5 billion in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Building Congress, which promotes the construction industry, estimates that while residential construction spending will reach a record $10.2 billion in 2014, only about 20,000 new units will be created.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is a 9% increase from the number of units created in 2013 but still significantly below the more than 30,000 units constructed annually between 2005 and 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"One area of concern, however, is the relative lack of new housing that is being created by virtue of all this residential spending," said Richard Anderson, president of the Building Congress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts point to the high cost of land, which makes it difficult to build anything other than luxury condos. Rezonings have also made it difficult to build in some parts of the city where land might be cheaper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, developers face significant challenges navigating the city's bureaucracy. Mr. de Blasio has pledged to make the Department of Buildings easier to navigate for smaller developers in the outer-boroughs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While the luxury residential market is booming in Manhattan and in parts of Brooklyn and Queens, we have our work cut out for us in terms of achieving Mayor de Blasio's plan to create or preserve 200,000 units of affordable housing over the next decade," Mr. Anderson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Building Congress expects the number of construction jobs to reach 122,700 in 2014, which is up slightly from 2013 but still well below the 2008 peak of 132,600 jobs.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Joe Light </div><div>851 words</div><div>13 August 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price appreciation is slowing, a welcome trend for potential buyers but a troubling one for homeowners still looking for relief from underwater mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family housing prices rose 4.4% in the year that ended in the second quarter, the slowest annual pace since 2012, according to a report released Tuesday by <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The association found that median prices for existing single-family homes grew year-over-year in 122 of 173 metropolitan areas it tracked, while prices declined in 47 metro areas. Only 19 areas showed double-digit year-over-year price increases, a substantial drop from the 37 cities that showed such increases in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said price appreciation is slowing in part because buyers, including investors, have become more cautious and are pulling back from the market amid the big price gains of the past year. At the same time, those higher prices persuaded more homeowners to put their homes up for sale, adding inventory and reducing the urgency to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those trends are good news for potential buyers, who have had to deal with heated competition for a relatively small number of homes on the market in many cities as well as a near percentage-point increase in 30-year mortgage rates since May 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the trends serve as a warning to some owners who bought their homes near the peak of the market and still owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth, said NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun. A report from real-estate research firm <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> said that at the end of the first quarter, owners of 6.3 million homes were still underwater, or owed more than their homes were worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With this price deceleration, it could be another three to five years for some people to go above water," Mr. Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stan Humphries, chief economist of real-estate-information site <span class="companylink">Zillow Inc</span>., said that home values in many markets are likely to oscillate over the next few years, as the market tries to find stable ground after years of boom, bust and recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're definitely at an inflection point. We see moderation [in price gains] continuing," he said, based on Zillow's own data on home values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, Mr. Yun said that the second quarter showed a significant divergence in price change between metro areas and regions. While the median existing single-family home price between the second quarters of 2013 and 2014 rose 7.3% in the West to $297,400, home prices in the Northeast fell 0.9% to $255,500, the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the most strongly rebounding housing markets, such as Phoenix and Las Vegas, are also showing signs of cooling, Mr. Yun said. The Phoenix area, which had been experiencing double-digit year-over-year price growth, saw prices rise 8.3% in the second quarter from the previous year to $198,600, the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR report said that prices dropped the most sharply in Elmira, N.Y. with a near 30% decline between the second quarters of 2013 and 2014 to $87,800.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, median home prices can be skewed as the kinds of homes being sold shift between the higher and lower ends of the market, a factor that can have an especially strong influence on statistics from small metropolitan areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cathy Weil, president-elect of the Elmira-Corning Regional Association of Realtors, said that the Elmira median home price was skewed by the mix of homes sold in the second quarter. She said that her area has seen sales pick up significantly and some high-price homes have been receiving multiple offers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the NAR report, the most expensive housing markets in the second quarter were San Jose, Calif., where the median price was $899,500; San Francisco, $769,600; Anaheim-Santa Ana, Calif., $691,900; Honolulu, $678,500; and San Diego, $504,200.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some home buyers say that they've noticed the market cool somewhat. Trey Denton, a 31-year-old metals broker in Newburgh, Ind., bought an investment property for about $175,000 at the end of June, which he plans to list for sale this Friday. He said that he hopes to sell the home before the winter and that he feels there is an increased sense of urgency to sell so he won't have to wait until the spring home-buying season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's definitely a risk with waiting," Mr. Denton said. "With interest rates looking to creep up next year, the market could fall."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agent Kevin Eastridge, who is president of the Indiana Association of Realtors, said that his housing market around Evansville, Ind., "stopped dead" between November and February, and was "excellent" between March and May. In June, activity dropped off a bit, but things heated up again in July, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are running into some multiple-offer situations but those are the exception rather than the rule," he said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Increases in home prices across much of the New York suburbs over the past year persuaded many homeowners it was finally time to put up for-sale signs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the shock of those higher prices also began to make buyers more cautious, brokers say. The apparent result: Sales across the region fell from last year's strong pace, and prices have stopped climbing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the second quarter, the peak spring selling season, sales of single-family homes fell 12.1% in Westchester County, compared with the second quarter of 2013, according to brokers Houlihan Lawrence. The median prices were up 0.8% during the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Long Island, excluding the East End, sales declined 6.3% and prices were up 0.8%, according a market report by <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New Jersey, strong growth in the market last year appeared to have stalled. Last year, the number of home contracts signed rose 16% above the 2012 pace. But in the first half of 2014, they declined 8%, said Jeffrey Otteau, an appraiser and market analyst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a New Jersey home fell 0.1% during the second quarter, compared with the year-earlier period, when it rose 4.1% from the same quarter in 2012, Mr. Otteau said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many analysts said the seemingly gloomy sales could be good news, a sign of a return to normalcy in a market that was still recovering from the long hangover of the last great housing bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to this theory, 2013 saw the release of "an abundance of pent-up demand" from people who could afford to buy but who had been "waiting in the wings for prices to stop declining," Mr. Otteau said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan Miller, an appraiser who prepared market reports for Long Island and Westchester for brokers <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>, described 2013's rapid price growth as "an anomaly." He attributed those figures to an easing of uncertainty over both federal spending and the slow recovery at the end of 2012, and a fear that mortgage rates were about to rise sharply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As prices rise, inventory tips into the market," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Meyers, managing principal of Houlihan Lawrence, said that the market in the northern suburbs of New York is leveling off at "very healthy level of sales."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are in a bit of a Goldilocks scenario, not too hot or too cold," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John McCann put his sprawling home in Cresskill, N.J., on the market for $2.68 million in mid-May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has five bedrooms, a circular staircase and sits on just over an acre of land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This was something we would not have considered a year ago because the value to sell wasn't there," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McCann, general counsel to the Bergen County sheriff's office, paid $1.5 million for his house in 1996 and had renovated it since, adding crown moldings and a new kitchen. He is now planning to move his family across Bergen County to be closer to the equestrian stable where his youngest daughter trains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His broker, Jolanta Krygier of Prominent Properties Sotheby's International Realty in Saddle River, said that despite the shrinking inventory since the crash of the housing market, there was still a strong supply in the area and "it is still a buyer's market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second-quarter data revealed pockets of strength and weakness in each area within the tri-state region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some New Jersey counties affected by superstorm Sandy, the second-quarter numbers suggested recovery was under way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cape May had the largest increase in median prices in the first half of the year of any county -- 18.6% -- compared with the same period in 2013. Ocean County was second with a 10.3% increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Long Island, median prices on the north shore of Nassau County were up 7.7%, while they fell 3.2% in Suffolk County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices rose sharply in lower Westchester County, with the median price in Scarsdale in the first half of the year, $1.495 million, up 16% from the same period in 2013, setting a record, Mr. Meyers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cathy Hall, a nurse with an expanded ranch house on Mamaroneck Road in Scarsdale, said she waited and watched the market for several years. When she finally decided to sell, she found a buyer fast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her three-bedroom house was modest but has a large lot and a large pool. So her broker, Andrea Price of Houlihan Lawrence, urged her to hold off listing until late spring when the pool was filled and ready.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house listed for $1.369 million in June, and Ms. Hall said she had a deal within five days for $1.327 million. It is due to close in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You have to buy in a town that has good resales and that means good schools," Ms. Hall said, "and you can't put Formica in your kitchen."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential construction in the city has been slow to rebound after the recession, posing an obstacle to the de Blasio administration's goal to leverage the real-estate market to build 80,000 apartments for low- and middle-income families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast to other major U.S. cities, the number of units authorized in New York City through building permits remains well below levels before the market crashed in late 2008, according to <span class="companylink">U.S. Census Bureau</span> figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York, permits for 17,995 new housing units were issued in 2013, slightly more than half the nearly 34,000 units authorized in 2008 and below the number approved for 2002.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By comparison, builders are busier than they've been in years in many other major cities where rents and housing prices have been growing. San Francisco, one of the hottest markets in the country in the past few years, issued permits for about 4,500 units in 2013, nearly double those authorized in 2005. Washington, D.C., Seattle and Boston, among others, are also above precrash levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should it continue, New York's sluggish pace of construction could percolate through the city economy. Rents and housing prices likely would continue to rise, given a growing population, leaving New Yorkers with less money to spend on restaurants and other activities. Less development also means fewer construction jobs, though employment in the sector is near peak levels due to office-tower construction and the work on big civic projects such as the Second Avenue extension of the subway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate analysts and developers point to a combination of factors they say have made New York an increasingly inhospitable place to build housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a whole litany of challenges -- land costs, high construction costs, the difficulty in getting financing, the real estate taxes, the permitting process, arcane building codes, landmark districts," said Douglas Durst, chairman of the Durst Organization, a real-estate company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Durst said he struggled to compete with luxury-condo developers who routinely pay more than $700 a square foot for buildable sites in the southern half of Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means developers generally will need to sell what they build for more than $2,500 a square foot, or $3 million for a 1,200-square-foot apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mayor Bill de Blasio's affordable-housing strategy hinges on requiring developers to build new apartments in areas where the administration changes zoning laws to allow for taller buildings. But that approach counts on developers believing they can make the profits they want on the market-rate apartments to cover the cost of building the affordable units. And promoting high-rise development in residential parts of Brooklyn and Queens -- where land prices are cheaper -- risks monthslong battles with community groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, 8,000 affordable units a year would barely touch the amount of new housing that the city needs to accommodate a growing population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I would never say that we are happy with the numbers. It's one of the reasons that we have a housing plan," said Carl Weisbrod, director of the Department of City Planning. "The demand for housing is inexhaustible. That means that we have to plan and prepare for a denser city. That's going to require zoning changes that will promote that density and make housing easier to build and we're very much committed to reducing the time and the costs for those to build housing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Anderson, president of the New York Building Congress, describes the city's buildings-approval process as so complicated it has given rise to an entire industry of expediters who are paid by developers to speed up the approvals for their projects. Administration officials have promised to make process move along more quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More difficult for the city to address are other factors, such as the challenges developers face in obtaining financing. Lenders are wary of the high development costs, and they are often unwilling to lend to developers unless they put in significantly more money than was required in the years before the downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a challenging market because of high land costs, high construction costs, and high real estate taxes," said Alan Wiener, who oversees multifamily lending in New York at <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo &amp; Co</span>., one of the largest apartment lenders in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing developers say they are also squeezed by the more than 40 historic districts created during the Bloomberg administration. Under Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the city also rezoned about a third of the city, much of it to restrict development. Bloomberg officials said those steps were critical to preserving the character of neighborhoods during a frantic real estate boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone is eager for a return to the levels of production that the city experienced in 2003 to 2008. Some developers ran out of money and left condo projects half-finished for years, and once-affordable enclaves such as Williamsburg were transformed by luxury towers. Many critics of development say the city feels perpetually crowded because the public sector has failed to make sufficient investments in transportation, parks and schools.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Candace Jackson   </div><div>649 words</div><div>11 August 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Asia</div><div>AWSJ</div><div>23</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Lake Tahoe property sold Thursday for $1.6 million -- in bitcoin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property is one of just a handful of residential real-estate transactions in months that have used virtual currency -- and potentially a record in terms of price. It went for 2,739 bitcoins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Hull, director of sales at the resort where the property is located, Martis Camp, said the buyer was a "Silicon Valley entrepreneur" but declined to disclose his name. He said the buyer plans to build a home on the site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea to pay for the Tahoe property with bitcoin came from the buyer, Mr. Hull said. "When we originally heard the idea of bitcoin, everybody had a little pause," he said. "We weren't educated at how the transaction would go."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The digital currency was introduced in 2009 and isn't backed by a central bank or government. It can be created by a computer process known as mining and traded online through unregulated Internet exchanges. The value of bitcoin, which began at just pennies, has fluctuated over the past few years. The price of a bitcoin topped $1,100 in late 2013, but is now around $590, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Index. It can shift significantly throughout the day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BitPay, an online-merchant processor that operates similarly to <span class="companylink">PayPal</span> or Worldpay, handled the Tahoe transaction. Stephanie Wargo, BitPay's vice president of marketing, said about 85% of the site's merchants are online retailers. Teslas and Lamborghinis also have been purchased with bitcoin through the site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To transfer property using bitcoin on BitPay, the seller creates an invoice for the price of the property, either in bitcoin or U.S. dollars, as BitPay can pay out in either currency. The bitcoin exchange rate is guaranteed for 15 minutes after the invoice is created, during which the purchaser must complete payment. If the payment isn't completed within the allotted time, the exchange rate is recalculated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The roughly 5,600 square-meter home site has views of mountain range and is located in Martis Camp, a private luxury resort in Truckee, Calif. The resort, near Lake Tahoe's north shore, has a Tom Fazio-designed golf course, a 44-seat movie theater and an "aerial adventure park" with rope courses and a zip line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, an anonymous buyer paid 800 bitcoins, or more than $500,000, for a two-bedroom luxury villa in Bali. In May, a home in suburban Kansas City sold for about $500,000 in bitcoin through BitPay. BitPay said the Lake Tahoe site is the most expensive property transaction the service has handled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several sellers have tried listing their properties in bitcoins, including a Las Vegas real-estate developer who asked $7.85 million for his 25,000-square-foot home. He has since taken the property off the market, according to his listing agent. BitPremier, a website that sells luxury items in exchange for bitcoins has listings for homes, including one in Naples, Fla., for $969,000 (1,643.373 bitcoins) and a 9,845-square-foot house in the Bighorn Golf Club in Palm Desert, Calif., for $7.45 million (12,627.119 bitcoins).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As far as I know, this would definitely be a record breaker" for a publicly disclosed property sale using bitcoins, said Alan Silbert, chief executive of BitPremier, which wasn't involved in the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Johnson, the general manager of DMB/Highlands Group LLC, Martis Camp's developer, said the company is now open to using bitcoins for future sales. "We're in the business of dealing with predominantly the Bay Area," said Mr. Hull. "A lot of our buyer base is in the tech sector, and there are a lot of people who have bitcoin holdings."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Joe Light </div><div>501 words</div><div>8 August 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rate of fresh foreclosure proceedings has fallen to the lowest level in eight years, the latest evidence that an improving economy and rising home values are preventing greater numbers of homeowners from falling behind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span> reported Thursday that foreclosure proceedings began on just 0.4% of mortgages loans during the second quarter. That was down from 0.45% in the first quarter and far below the 1.42% rate seen at the crisis's worst point in the third quarter of 2009. The last time the rate of so-called foreclosure starts was as low as 0.4% was in the second quarter of 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the mortgage delinquency rate -- the percentage of loans that have at least one late payment but aren't in the foreclosure process -- was a seasonally adjusted 6.04%, the lowest since the end of 2007 and down from 6.11% in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Fratantoni, the MBA's chief economist, said that the primary drivers of falling delinquencies were rising home prices and the recovering job market. Real estate information company <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> on Tuesday reported that national home prices rose 7.5% in the year through June, the 28th consecutive month of year-over-year price increases. As well, last Friday's nonfarm payrolls report showed the best six-month stretch of hiring since 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christopher George, president of mortgage-banking firm CMG Financial in San Ramon, Calif., said that some homeowners with underwater homes might have gone into foreclosure in the past but now are making payments in the hope that home prices continue to recover. "A lot of people are looking around and saying let's sacrifice because we can see there might be a light at the end of the tunnel," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the latest figures are encouraging, it doesn't mean the foreclosure problem is over. Banks have over a million loans already in the foreclosure process that must be worked through. In percentage terms, 2.49% of loans were in the foreclosure process at the end of the second quarter. While that was down from the peak of the crisis, it is still well above the 1% or so rate before the crisis began.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That could be one reason why banks are showing little willingness to extend mortgage credit to all but the safest borrowers. In earnings calls over the past few weeks, some lenders have said that regulatory concerns, along with multi-billion-dollar legal settlements related to crisis-era woes make them wary of expanding certain kinds of lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics Chief Economist Mark Zandi said that it likely will take two to three more years before lenders are able to work through the large backlog of properties in or near foreclosure. "Ten years later, the already-painful foreclosure crisis is finally coming down to an end," Mr. Zandi said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hawaii is home to some of the best beaches, surfing and golf in the U.S. It also has some of the country's highest home prices. As a result, home buyers can get jumbo loans starting at $721,000, far above the $417,000 threshold in other parts of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sale price for a single-family home in the state was at an all-time high of $700,000 in June, up 3.4% from a year ago, according to the Hawaii Board of Realtors. In Honolulu, the state's most expensive residential market, the median home price is expected to hit $773,800 in 2015 and $826,000 in 2016, according to the University of Hawaii Economic Research Organization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the typical jumbo-loan borrower, "the median is almost the bottom of the market" in Honolulu, says Carl Bonham, the research organization's executive director. "If a business executive who wanted to be close to downtown looked for a house priced at the median, he wouldn't find anything."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential construction has been slow to keep up with population growth, driving up prices. Also contributing are high construction costs for labor and materials, as well as a lack of available land on Oahu, the business hub of the islands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dentist Jason Ako and his wife, Rhona, both 49 years old, have bought and flipped 22 homes in Hawaii over the past 10 years. But when they were shopping for a family home in East Oahu near Diamond Head, they found themselves in a home-buying battle. "There aren't many properties that come on the market there and they sell quickly," Mr. Ako says. "My wife scanned the listings 20 or 30 times a day."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They found their dream home, listed for $2.2 million, across the street from the Waialae Country Club. The five-bedroom, four-bath house featured a swimming pool with waterfall -- which the couple's sons, 12-year-old Winston and 9-year-old Sebastian, could enjoy. (The Akos have two other sons who no longer live at home.) Within a day of being listed, it had more than 20 offers, many of which were cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To win out, the Akos made a bid equal to the asking price, offered a $50,000 nonrefundable deposit and agreed to go forward with the deal regardless what the home inspection revealed. They were preapproved for a $1.1 million jumbo mortgage at <span class="companylink">Bank of Hawaii</span> with a 50% down payment, but also agreed to pay cash if for any reason that financing fell through. "You need to be creative in today's market and more creative than somebody else," Mr. Ako says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, homes purchased in Hawaii with loans greater than $625,500 were up 13% in number and 14% in dollar volume when comparing January through May 2014 with the same period in 2013, according to Hawaii Bureau of Conveyances. Jumbo thresholds vary by island: on Maui, it's $626,750; in Kauai, it's $713,000; and on the island of Oahu, which includes Honolulu, it's $721,050.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the jumbo-lending action is from buyers in the continental U.S. purchasing luxury second homes on the islands, says Joy McLaughlin, who heads the residential mortgage division at <span class="companylink">First Hawaiian Bank</span>. "We are a resort state, and everyone would like to own a house in paradise," she adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few Hawaiian lenders have been expanding their jumbo products to meet the demand. <span class="companylink">Bank of Hawaii</span>, for example, added a new 10-year adjustable-rate jumbo mortgage in January, says Jim Polk, senior vice president and manager of the lender's mortgage-banking division. Here are a few more considerations:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Prequalification is key. Requirements include a 20% to 25% down payment, depending on the loan size, at least a 45% debt-to-income ratio and a high credit score to get the best rates, says Yvonne Ako, president of Mortgage Bankers Association of Hawaii and vice president and residential-loan manager at <span class="companylink">American Savings Bank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Budget for additional costs. Homes near the ocean may require flood insurance. Also, homeowner-association dues tend to be higher than on the continental U.S., which could be a factor when calculating the borrower's debt-to-income ratio in mortgage qualification, says Allen Seelenbinder, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>'s regional home loans executive for Hawaii.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Rethink the house. Can't afford a jumbo? Consider a condo. While the condo median sales price is up 9.1% from June 2013, it is still at $360,000, and there are several new condo projects under construction in Honolulu. "I can see three to four cranes outside my window," Ms. Ako says.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Wayne Arnold   </div><div>908 words</div><div>7 August 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>21</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HONG KONG -- Global investors pumping funds into Asia in search of higher returns have added office space to their shopping lists, new data from Cushman &amp; Wakefield indicate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Encouraged by low global interest rates and rising evidence of world-wide economic recovery, foreign investors bought office space for a record $6.16 billion in the region in the second quarter, according to the U.S.-based commercial-real-estate agency, more than double what they bought in the same three months of 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a lot of capital just floating around," said Sigrid Zialcita, Cushman &amp; Wakefield's managing director for Asian research in Singapore. "It's a vote of confidence for the region. They look at Asia-Pacific as a future growth market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">South Korea and Australia are at the forefront of demand, Ms. Zialcita said. She said office rentals yield between 5% and 7% a year in those markets. Foreign purchases in South Korea more than doubled in the second quarter to $1.3 billion, led by the $497.7 million purchase in June of the 22-story K Twin Towers in Seoul's central business district by <span class="companylink">KKR &amp; Co</span>. and Hong Kong-based private-equity firm LIM Advisers from Korean property fund manager Vestas Investment Management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>'s $403 million purchase of a 50% stake in Sydney's 33-storey Westpac Place from local property developer <span class="companylink">Mirvac Group</span> topped the $3 billion in foreign buying in Australia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign investors also more than doubled their purchases in China, to $931 million, defying a 35% decline in overall buying of office space, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hong Kong-based private-equity firm Gaw Capital paid $928 million in April to buy Pacific Century Place, an office and residential building in Beijing's Sanlitun shopping district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surge in foreign demand for Asia's commercial real estate is part of booming demand for assets around the region -- and in emerging economies world-wide -- as record-low interest rates in the U.S., Europe and Japan drive investors into higher-risk assets abroad to offset low returns at home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Emerging markets saw $44 billion in portfolio inflows in July, according to the <span class="companylink">Institute of International Finance</span> in Washington, the highest monthly amount in two years, bringing total investment in emerging markets to $195 billion this year, nearly equaling the $208.9 billion for all of 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pouring of money into riskier assets earned warnings last month from the U.S. Federal Reserve and the <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span> that investors may be excessively optimistic. Central bankers in emerging markets worry not only that rapid inflows of speculative money will create inflation and create asset-price bubbles, but that a rapid reversal could send their currencies plunging, potentially causing financial crises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Concerns about such risks are rising as improving U.S. economic growth gives rise to predictions that the <span class="companylink">Fed</span> will eventually start raising rates. Not only might that attract global funds back to the relative safety of the U.S., but higher rates could force heavily indebted investors to sell riskier assets, sparking a correction in prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steeling themselves for such risks, Asian central banks have amassed almost $7.5 trillion in foreign-currency reserves. Authorities in Hong Kong and Singapore have gone further, reining in property speculation by imposing restrictions on investment and real-estate-related lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China and South Korea recently lifted restrictions on housing investment in a bid to arrest falling prices and slowing growth. "The slowdown is mostly on the residential side," said Christie Ju, an analyst at Jefferies in Hong Kong, "so the stimulus is unlikely to come to commercial property."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, hopes for improved economic growth and higher yields drew foreign investors into commercial office space in both countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign investors now dominate buying in South Korea, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield, accounting for almost 70% of all purchases in the second quarter. Ms. Zialcita said foreigners were enticed not only by relatively high yields, but also by hopes that an improving global economy would buoy demand for Korean exports, leading to more need for office space as companies expand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A similar logic is driving foreign demand for other Korean assets. Foreigners have bought at least $4.4 billion in Korean stocks this year, according to Jefferies. And as of June, U.S. investors had bought half of the Korean bonds sold globally in 2014, according to <span class="companylink">Bank of America Merrill Lynch</span>. Based on Dealogic data, that would represent $10.7 billion in investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $3 billion of Australian office space foreigners bought was also more than double their purchases last year. Ms. Zialcita said that despite the fading out of Australia's mining boom, rental yields of roughly 6% in Sydney and Melbourne and 7% in Perth kept foreign demand strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Even if interest rates go up," she said, "the spread is still very attractive."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada is the largest source of buying into markets around Asia, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield, accounting for $1.9 billion in purchases in the second quarter. Much of that was attributable to the conclusion of a deal for the assets in Australia's Commonwealth Office Property Fund, in which the <span class="companylink">Canada Pension Plan Investment Board</span> was one of two buyers. Canada was followed by the $1.8 billion in purchases by investors from the U.S.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales in Connecticut jumped in June, but prices declined, a real-estate research firm said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Warren Group said 2,799 single-family homes were sold in June, up nearly 6% since June 2013. The firm said the increase was the best since last August, when 2,897 homes were sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices, however, fell 3.2% from June 2013. The median sales price of a single-family home statewide decreased to $276,000 from $285,000 in June 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second-quarter sales fell by about 5%, with 6,679 sales, compared with 7,020 in the second quarter of 2013.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ample Room for Gloom at <span class="companylink">Realogy</span></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing rally failed to carry home sales over the threshold this spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices rose and mortgage rates fell, but buyers remained reluctant. That is bad for <span class="companylink">Realogy</span>, the largest real-estate brokerage franchiser in the U.S., which reports second-quarter results Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts expect earnings of 56 cents a share, a penny less than a year before. Estimates already have come down 27% over the past three months. And the stock is down nearly 26% since the start of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately for investors, that may not be the end of <span class="companylink">Realogy</span>'s downward journey. To begin with, the stock isn't cheap, trading at 23.4 times forward estimated earnings. That is pricing in a lot of growth. It is also at a premium to competitor Re/Max at 19.4 times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the housing rebound is sputtering -- bad news all round for <span class="companylink">Realogy</span>. Around 55% of the company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization is generated by its franchise business, according to Sterne Agee. Another 25% comes from the brokerages it owns. The remainder flows from other residential activities, primarily title work and relocation services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of those businesses are dependent on sales volumes of existing homes and their price. With the residential housing market somewhat stagnant in April and May, it is unlikely <span class="companylink">Realogy</span>'s brokers were rolling in commission income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> estimates that seasonally adjusted existing-home sales were on an annual pace of just 4.87 million during the quarter, a 3.8% decline from a year earlier. According to Sterne Agee's analysis, a market that produces around 4.8 million existing-home sales would result in full-year net revenue of about $5.26 billion for <span class="companylink">Realogy</span> -- below current estimates of $5.35 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">June saw an improvement in existing-home sales but nowhere near enough to make up for the prior two months' lag. And the year's earlier weakness may be returning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR's June read of pending home sales -- considered a leading indicator for existing home sales in coming months -- was surprisingly weak. Plus, mortgage applications fell at the end of July. That may undermine hopes that rising housing inventory will lead to future sales growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without that, don't expect better earnings, or a more buoyant share price, to come knocking on <span class="companylink">Realogy</span>'s door.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Gregory Zuckerman </div><div>946 words</div><div>2 August 2014</div><div>20:01</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Sunday</div><div>SNJR</div><div>WSJSunday</div><div>WSJ1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. real-estate market has stormed back over the past five years after enduring its most brutal period since the Great Depression. The rebound has rewarded investors and boosted the overall economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones U.S. Real Estate Index, whose components include real-estate investment trusts as well as mortgage, realty and forestry companies, has climbed 92% since early 2009. That gain, amid a rise of about 20% in the median price of new and existing homes over the past two years, is a bit less than the 114% rise for the S&amp;P 500 index. But it's an impressive recovery for a sector devastated by a historic slump starting in mid-2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, however, there are growing signs of a slowdown. While the current weakness could provide investors with an opportunity to place new wagers at lower prices, analysts warn that the environment has become more challenging. If the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> begins raising interest rates next year, as expected, it could become harder to make money from real-estate investments, the analysts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices around the U.S. rose 9.3% in May from a year earlier, according to the Case-Shiller index. But that rise was less than forecast and represented the lowest annualized gain since February 2013. On a monthly basis, home prices fell 0.3% in June, the first negative month since January 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at Lindsey Group, notes that the supply of homes for sale today represents 5.8 months of demand, the most since October 2011. All regions have seen declining new-home sales lately, and new mortgage applications are also slipping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The first-time home buyer is just not the factor that it once was," he says. "Without the first-time home buyer, and now with a reduction in the pace of investor purchases, the recovery will remain lumpy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Good for Buyers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For home buyers, the slowdown is good: Slowing price gains and low interest rates make homes more affordable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"From an individual perspective, the best investment you can make is to buy a primary residence," John Paulson, who runs hedge fund <span class="companylink">Paulson &amp; Co</span>., recently said. "Today financing costs are extraordinarily low. You can get a 30-year mortgage somewhere around 4½%."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a much more challenging environment for real-estate investment trusts, or REITs. These are shares of firms that own and operate hotel, office and other commercial real-estate, and invest in mortgage securities. They pay at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders as dividends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs have been among the best performers for much of the year, partly because they yield nearly 4% on average—attractive in a low-rate environment. The MSCI U.S. REIT Index is up about 15% this year, well ahead of the overall stock market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But REITs could come under pressure if interest rates rise. Last week, yields on 10-year Treasurys climbed as evidence grew that the U.S. economy had firmed, making a rate boost more likely. Further, REITs are considered expensive based on "adjusted funds from operations," a widely used metric for valuing these shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Risky Bets</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As worrisome: The best-performing REITs have been those associated with more debt and risk, says Mike Kirby, director of research at Green Street Advisors, which specializes in REIT research. "Smaller, highly levered REITs with lower-quality property portfolios [have] outperformed," Mr. Kirby says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Larger, high-quality REITs with lower levels of borrowing have tended to do better over the long term, so they're a better bet during the new period of uncertainty, some analysts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Examples of safer and attractive REITs, Green Street says, include Sam Zell's <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> (EQR) and <span class="companylink">Retail Properties of America</span> (RPAI), which have dividends of approximately 3% and 4%, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, it's likely a mistake to become too bearish on housing. Analysts at <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> still expect housing prices to rise about 7% this year. Las Vegas, San Francisco and Miami remain strong, while Cleveland, Charlotte, N.C., and New York have lagged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Double-digit home-price gains were unsustainable" because income growth has been about 2%, says Mr. Boockvar. "We should be cheering slower home-price gains, not fearing them, because it is the main factor that will entice the newly created household to consider buying instead of renting."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Todd Mansfield, chief executive of real-estate developer Crescent Communities, encourages investors to look at REITs and other companies focused on the Sunbelt region. "A growing employment base has helped to diversify and strengthen that region's economy, especially in secondary cities such as Austin, Nashville, Raleigh and Charlotte, N.C.," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs including <span class="companylink">Camden Property Trust</span> (CPT), <span class="companylink">Mid-America Apartment</span> Communities (MAA) and <span class="companylink">Associated Estates Realty</span> (<span class="companylink">AEC</span>) are focused on the Sunbelt, Mr. Mansfield says. He's a fan of office REITs including <span class="companylink">Highwoods Properties</span> (HIW) and <span class="companylink">Cousins Properties</span> (CUZ).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some home builders, such as <span class="companylink">WCI Communities</span>, which left bankruptcy five years ago, also could do well because they focus on growing areas such as Florida, Mr. Mansfield says. "You can still invest in real estate but your head needs to be on a swivel and you need to be ready to get out fast" if rates rise, says Matthew Tuttle, who runs Tuttle Tactical Management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He recommends exchange-traded funds that focus on REITs such as the SPDR Dow Jones REIT (RWR) and iShares US REIT (IYR). ETFs give investors a low-cost, diversified way to invest in real estate and are actively traded, enabling them to buy and sell easily.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Josh Barbanel </div><div>923 words</div><div>1 August 2014</div><div>05:37</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Striver's Row is facing an identity crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, an 1891 house sold for almost $2.89 million, a record price for the Harlem neighborhood that left some older Strivers worried something neighborly was being lost as affluent buyers bid up prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"After a point, only certain wealthy people can afford to move in," said Montez Davidson, the widow of a physician and acupuncturist who practiced out of their home on West 139th Street for many years. "I don't know that the new people moving in are Strivers. They have made it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Striver's Row was once a center for the African-American elite in the golden age of Harlem. Doctors, lawyers, businessmen and musicians lived in rows of elegant homes on West 138th and West 139th streets between Adam Clayton Powell Jr. and Frederick Douglass boulevards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eubie Blake, the pianist and composer, lived there, as did W.C. Handy, the blues composer, Adam Clayton Powell Jr., the pastor and long-serving congressman, and Louis T. Wright, the first black surgeon on the staff of <span class="companylink">Harlem Hospital</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Harlem declined in the 1960s and 1970s, some properties in the neighborhood fell into disrepair and some became single-room occupancy hotels. Eventually, a long slow turnaround began.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last decade, more than a third of the houses have sold. Most of the buyers are whites and Asian, say residents, attracted to the neighborhood as much by its leafy streets and its relatively affordable prices as its history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the surrounding neighborhood, whites rose from 1.3% of the population to 6% between 2000 and 2010, according to the U.S. Census. The census counted 711 more white residents and 699 fewer blacks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The name Striver's Row reflected both the admiration and envy of those who lived on the blocks and the fact that many prominent households were still financially striving. Many rented out parts of their houses to boarders to make ends meet, said Michael Henry Adams, a preservationist and historian.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with many houses selling, even some longtime boosters of the neighborhood said they were ambivalent about the changes. Elois Dupree, the head of a block association on Striver's Row, said the tight bonds in the neighborhood were loosening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You don't get that sense of camaraderie we had before," she said. "Children would play on the block and neighbors would watch out for them. Now children stay indoors."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some new buyers say they feel welcome in the neighborhood—at least most of the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Philippe Courtois, an owner of a Paris decorative painting company, Atelier Premiere, that did work on the Oval Office in White House, moved in last year with his wife and three children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He sent his youngest daughter to a neighborhood public preschool and his older children to a bilingual French-English charter school on West 120th Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he had good relations with his neighbors but "some don't like the changes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They are afraid that Harlem will not be the Harlem they always knew," he said. "They have no choice. The changes are progress, it is going to improve itself more and more."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, Denise Fisher, who bought a house on West 139th Street in 2008, says she and her husband, Robert, a dentist, spend more time with neighbors in Harlem than they did in their last neighborhood in Chappaqua.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are very cognizant of some of the history" of the neighborhood she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Striver's Way was built in 1891 by David H. King Jr., a builder who created the masonry base of the Statue of Liberty. The houses are built of limestone and brick, in varying combinations, and they have rear alleys—an unusual feature for New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But they were put up during a speculative wave of investment that ended in panic, and Mr. King lost control of the project. From the first it was a project for whites. Blacks were offered a chance to buy houses in 1919. Some of the houses were priced at about $8,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices and interest in Striver's Row have revived. In 1986, Bob Dylan bought a house there for $395,000, and sold it in 2000 for $560,000. During the last real-estate boom, sales were strong and one home sold for $2.4 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So in April, when two agents from Halstead Property, Ivonne Velasquez and Norman McHugh, listed the 20-foot-wide house at 221 E. 138th St., the asking price was set at $2.445 million. They soon had multiple offers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The winning bid at almost $2.89 million came from Josh Zoia, the superintendent of KIPP charter schools in New York City. Mr. Zoia's broker, Andrew Azoulay of Town Residential, said Mr. Zoia and his family originally planned to live in the house, but decided instead to renovate the space and rent it out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carl McCaskill, who lives in a nearby Strivers Row house, was the executor for the estate of the last owner of the house, who purchased it in 2011 for $1.324 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McCaskill, a founder of a new black television network, Soul of the South Television, embraces the change. He noted that Harlem has always been on the cutting edge—from jazz to Malcolm X.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If Harlem is not new it is not Harlem," he said. "Harlem is all about the avant guard."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Larry Ellison Sells in Lake Tahoe for $20.35 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Oracle</span> billionaire Larry Ellison has sold one of his Lake Tahoe properties for $20.35 million, according to public records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale closed in mid-July and names the buyer as a California-based entity called Residential Property Mgmt LLC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Located on the east shore of Lake Tahoe in Glenbrook, Nev., the property is one of three parcels Mr. Ellison had listed together for $28.5 million in 2013 with Jennie Fairchild of Chase International. It contains a 9,242-square foot main house, which Mr. Ellison spent three years remodeling, with six bedrooms, eight full baths and one half bath. There is a soundproof screening room, a gym, a billiard room, a library and a sauna. Also on the property is a 1,326-square-foot, two-bedroom, three-bath guest house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other two parcels -- including a roughly 3,000-square-foot lakefront house and an adjoining vacant lot -- are still on the market, priced at $4.15 million, Ms. Fairchild said in an email. She declined to discuss the details of the sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ellison assembled the Glenbrook properties over three years. In 2006 he paid $11.7 million for the main house and 1.6 acres, according to public records. He then paid $3.3 million for two additional parcels in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He had originally intended the three properties to be his primary home at Tahoe. Instead, he got the chance to build a 7.6-acre estate on the north shore of the lake, so he decided to sell the Glenbrook compound, Ms. Fairchild told the Journal in an interview last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ellison, who founded the <span class="companylink">Oracle Corporation</span> in 1977, declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Cloutier of Coldwell Banker Select Real Estate in Zephyr Cove, Nev., who was not involved in the transaction, said the market for lakefront homes has been "very vital," with roughly nine sales on the east shore so far this year. Mr. Ellison's $20.35 million sale is among the most expensive of those, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hamptons Home of a Famed Socialite Hits the Market for $28 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before there was Paris Hilton, there was Consuelo Vanderbilt Balsan a Gilded Age heiress and socialite, renowned for her beauty and wealth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Ms. Balsan's onetime Hamptons home is slated to hit the market priced at $28 million with Tim Davis of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Located on Ox Pasture Road in Southampton, the shingle-style home was built around 1900 and is known as "Gardenside" or "Cara-Mia." Ms. Balsan, the great-granddaughter of railroad magnate Cornelius Vanderbilt, owned the house until her death in 1964.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Davis declined to identify the current owners, but said they are selling because they are not spending as much time there as they expected. According to public records, the estate is owned by Robert G. Goldstein, executive vice president and president of global gaming operations at <span class="companylink">Las Vegas Sands Corp</span>, and his wife Sheryl, who purchased the house in 2007 for $17.4 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Davis said the house underwent a major restoration and renovation when the current owners bought it, with new plumbing and electrical systems and the addition of an elevator. Original details remain in the home, such as the parquet wood floors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Located on two acres, the three-story house is roughly 9,000 square feet, Mr. Davis said, with seven bedrooms and 11 bathrooms. The master suite is about 1,500 square feet, he said, with his-and-hers dressing rooms and bathrooms and a terrace overlooking the garden. The house also includes porches and outdoor entertaining areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the grounds there's a gym, a red-clay tennis court, and a heated 45-foot pool with a bluestone terrace surrounded by white hydrangeas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Happy Hunting: Georgia Quail Plantation Sells</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a Reduced Price at Close to $28 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Longpine, a nearly 6,000-acre quail plantation near Thomasville, Ga., has sold after about five years on the market. According to public records, the sale price was $27.858 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initially listed for over $40 million, the property was most recently priced at $34 million, according to listing agent Jon Kohler of Jon Kohler &amp; Associates, who listed the property with his wife, Erica Kohler, and Erica Hanway of Plantation Marketing Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Founded in 1888, Longpine is one of the largest plantations in the Thomasville area, which became known as a quail-hunting destination in the late 1800s. In 1968, Longpine was purchased by Josephine Clay Ford, granddaughter of Henry Ford, the <span class="companylink">Ford Motor Company</span> founder, and her husband Walter Buhl Ford II. The couple's primary home was in Michigan, but they traveled to Longpine each year for quail-hunting season, according to their son, Alfred Brush Ford. Walter Buhl Ford II died in 1991 and Mrs. Ford in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyer was Rick B. Leverich, whose family founded Texas-based Bourland &amp; Leverich Supply Company. Mr. Leverich, who owns a ranch in Mexico and several in Texas, said he grew up quail hunting with his father and plans to keep Longpine, which he bought from the Ford family, largely as it is. Wildlife preservation and habitat management is "a passion of mine," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The white-brick main house on the property is 7,286 square feet with six bedrooms, six full bathrooms and three half baths. A manager's house, built about a century ago, is roughly 3,200 square feet; there are also other houses for staff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sold along with the property were horses, mules and bird dogs bred on the plantation. The property has a 20-stall horse barn and dog kennel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kohler said after a slowdown during the real estate downturn, the market for plantations has picked up, with buyers anxious to purchase hard assets such as land. "We're busier than we were at the heart of the boom," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A large townhouse in central London has been listed for GBP 25 million, or about $42.4 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The roughly 10,000-square-foot, 13-bedroom, eight-bathroom property, built between 1826 and 1845, comprises three separate apartments and a mews house and overlooks Eaton Place in London's Belgravia district. The building has a ground-floor patio, a first-floor terrace, a large roof terrace and a private elevator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christian Warman, the selling agent with <span class="companylink">Savills</span> in London, says the building is suitable as a family home or for a buyer looking to rent it out as an investment. He says the seller, whom he declined to identify, acquired the apartments over a period of time and now owns the whole building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building also has an adjoining mews house, which is currently occupied with a lease set to expire in September 2030.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Denver's Onetime Rocky Mountain Home Lists for $10.75 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Denver was famous for songs that extolled the beauty of nature and his Colorado home, including "Rocky Mountain High."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now home buyers have a chance to experience firsthand what he meant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The late singer-songwriter's longtime home in Aspen, Colo., is on the market for $10.75 million, according to listing agent Carol Dopkin of Aspen Snowmass Sotheby's International Realty. Ms. Dopkin, a friend of the family, also handled the sale of the house for $3.68 million to the current owners after Mr. Denver's death in 1997, she said. Those owners, whom she declined to name, used the house as a vacation home and are now selling it because their children are grown and they no longer use it as often.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Located in Aspen's Starwood subdivision, the house was Mr. Denver's primary home until his death, she said. Mr. Denver and his first wife, Annie, built the house in the early 1970s, said Ms. Dopkin, and expanded it over the years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On roughly 7.6 acres, the house is over 6,000 square feet with six bedrooms and 4 1/2 bathrooms. It has four wood-burning fireplaces, plus an outdoor swimming pool, and decks strategically placed to take advantage of the mountain views, Ms. Dopkin said. The current owners made some renovations, such as expanding the living room, but kept the home largely as it was in Mr. Denver's time. For example, the master suite has a fireplace and curved walls of custom-made stained glass that are "very John Denver," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A path leads from the main house to the guest house, part of which Mr. Denver used as a recording studio, Ms. Dopkin said. There's a barbecue area with an outdoor fireplace where Mr. Denver liked to play horseshoes and sit around the fire with friends, she said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. construction spending fell sharply in June, reflecting a drop in home and private-sector building and a dramatic pullback by state and local governments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction spending fell 1.8% from May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $950.2 billion, the Commerce Department said Friday. That marked the sharpest decline since January 2011. Public construction fell by the most in 12 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected construction spending to rise 0.4% in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, overall construction spending in May was far stronger than previously estimated. Construction spending rose 0.8% in May from a month earlier, up from an initially reported 0.1% gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop in June reflected slower activity in both private construction--which makes up more than 70% of all construction spending--and public construction. The 1% decline in private construction largely reflected a drop in the building of single-family homes, construction of commercial buildings, private schools and communications structures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Public construction fell by 4%, the sharpest drop since March 2002. Construction by state and local government fell by 5.2%, also the most in 12 years. Federal construction spending picked up at a healthy rate.</p>

</div><div>585 words</div><div>31 July 2014</div><div>06:27</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's yuan has rebounded from an unprecedented tumble earlier in the year, finishing July with a third monthly advance against the U.S. dollar and traders saying it is primed for further gains amid signs that the world's second-largest economy is strengthening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chinese currency has risen 1.5% against the dollar since it hit this year's low on April 30. On Thursday, the last trading day of the month, the dollar was buying 6.1747 yuan. The yuan is still down 2% for the year because of heavy losses between January and April, largely attributable to Beijing's efforts to shake out speculators betting on gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent strength comes as data rolls in showing better growth this month in manufacturing and the property market, deemed to be critical to the economy's health, also showing signs of life. That is a turnaround from the start of the year when fears grew over a potential hard landing for the economy and rising credit worries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As the signs of recovery firm up, the authorities should get more comfortable with allowing some [yuan] appreciation again," said Linan Liu, a <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> strategist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Huang Yi, a senior trader at <span class="companylink">China Guangfa Bank</span> that is partly owned by <span class="companylink">Citigroup Inc</span>., said the yuan may climb as much as 0.4%, with the dollar falling to 6.15 yuan in the third quarter. A lower number means a stronger yuan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"China is expected to enjoy a large trade surplus and with more corporate clients coming back to support the yuan," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A trade surplus indicates rising demand for exports and more inflows to China that add to purchases of the yuan. It recovered to $31.6 billion in June, from US$16.9 billion in the first quarter, the smallest quarterly surplus in two years. The surplus was expected to end July at $28.9 billion, according to information provider Wind Information Co.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The yuan, which is still tightly controlled, has been rising even as the central bank sets it weaker, a sign that traders' bets are outweighing authorities' efforts to control the currency. For more than half of the trading days in July, the <span class="companylink">People's Bank of China</span> set the "central parity rate"—against which the currency can trade 2% above or below in a day—weaker instead of stronger. But in the market, the yuan rose 0.5% for the month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span> said in a report Wednesday that the yuan remained moderately undervalued by 5% to 10%, given the large current-account surplus and economic fundamentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the offshore market, where the currency is freely traded, traders say global investors, including hedge funds, are betting again on appreciation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The yuan's strength has been accompanied by a strong performance of Chinese stocks. The Shanghai Composite Index rose to its highest level in seven months this past week, as investors snapped up big blue chips on the fresh signs of economic recovery and news of an official investigation into a high-profile official, Zhou Yongkang.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A corruption investigation into Mr. Zhou is a positive for the economy, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> analyst Lu Ting said, because it suggests that <span class="companylink">Communist Party</span> leader Xi Jinping has made significant progress in consolidating power and "the new government can finally focus on economic matters."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices across the U.S. slowed sharply to a single-digit pace in May on a year-over-year basis, the slowest rate since February 2013, according to a home-price report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A survey covering 10 major U.S. cities increased 9.4% in the year ended in May, said the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index survey released Tuesday. The 20-city price index increased 9.3%. That is down from a 10.8% yearly pace in April and much lower than the 9.9% expected by economists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On an unadjusted basis, the 10-city index and the 20-city composite each increased 1.1% in May over April. Seasonally adjusted, both indexes declined 0.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Past increases in home prices coupled with stagnant wage growth have recently eroded housing affordability. Home sales have struggled in the first half, and early data suggest more problems in the third quarter. The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> reported Monday that pending home sales fell 1.1% in June to stand 7.3% below year-ago levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Housing has been turning in mixed economic numbers in the last few months," said David M.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks finished little changed as investors paused ahead of the next <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> policy meeting and a slew of economic and corporate earnings reports due out this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 22.02 points, or 0.1%, to 16982.59. The S&amp;P 500 added 0.57 point, to 1978.91, while the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> Composite Index shed 4.65 points, or 0.1%, to 4444.91.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks started Monday heading lower, with selling fueled by another in a string of weak reports on housing.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Dow</span> was down as much as 82.85 points in the morning, but recovered as the day wore on. Despite the early move, traders said most investors were sitting tight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You can push around markets fairly easy on low volume," said Michael Antonelli, sales trader at Robert W. Baird.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Helping to keep activity restrained Monday was a full slate of news to come this week. On Wednesday, the <span class="companylink">Fed</span> will announce the results of its latest two-day policy-setting meeting. Investors expect the <span class="companylink">Fed</span> to continue paring back the bond purchases it has been using to ease monetary policy but make no other significant changes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors are also waiting on the monthly jobs report for July on Friday. A report on second-quarter economic growth is also on tap for Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists expect the <span class="companylink">Labor Department</span> to report that 230,000 jobs were added in July, a modest pullback from the 288,000 added in June.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week marks one of the busiest for second-quarter earnings. Among companies in the S&amp;P 500, 148 are due to report earnings this week, according to FactSet. So far, the news has been good, with companies in the S&amp;P 500 on track to report earnings growth of 6.4% from a year ago, according to FactSet.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. stocks slipped Monday following a disappointing reading on the housing market, while investors looked ahead to a busy week of data and corporate earnings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 32 points, or 0.2%, to 16928 in midday trading. The S&amp;P 500 index shed five points, or 0.2%, to 1974, while the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> Composite Index eased 19 points, or 0.4%, to 4431.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major indexes slid after a reading on pending home sales came in weaker than expected, the latest sign that the U.S. housing market remains weak despite low interest rates. The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said its index of pending home sales -- reflecting purchases under contract -- fell 1.1% to 102.7 in June, ending three months of gains. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a 0.5% rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A read on second-quarter gross domestic product is due Wednesday, while the <span class="companylink">U.S. government</span>'s monthly July jobs report is due on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This week is going to be a big test of the economy and the markets," said Mike Binger, senior portfolio manager at Gradient Investments, a $600 million investment firm based in Minneapolis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect the economy grew 2.9% in the second quarter. Employers are seen adding 234,000 jobs in July compared with 288,000 added in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the disappointing housing number, most investors are of the mind that the economy is steadily improving, said Michael Antonelli, sales trader at Robert W. Baird. "Most institutional clients have come around to the notion that unemployment is continuing to improve and the jobs situation is continuing to improve," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later this week, the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s policy-making body is due to convene. Investors are also looking out for any hints on when the <span class="companylink">Fed</span> might raise interest rates, stepping back from an accommodative stance widely believed to have helped fuel stocks' multiyear rally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of small companies fell. The <span class="companylink">Russell 2000</span> small-cap index declined nine points, or 0.8%, to 1136.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ireland's <span class="companylink">Ryanair Holdings</span>, Europe's largest discount airline, reported first-quarter profit soared, prompting it to raise its full-year profit forecast and promise a special dividend. U.S.-traded shares gained 2.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Family Dollar Stores</span> jumped 24% after news that the discount chain will be uired by <span class="companylink">Dollar Tree</span> in a cash-and-stock deal that values the struggling retailer at about $8.5 billion. Shares of <span class="companylink">Dollar Tree</span> advanced 3.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow fell 2.2% after the provider of online real-estate information reached a deal to buy rival <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> in a stock-for-stock deal valued at about $2.6 billion. <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> shares rose 12%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Tyson Foods</span> added 3.8% after the food giant said fiscal third-quarter profit and sales rose on higher prices and volumes. The company also said it was preparing to close its deal to buy <span class="companylink">Hillshire Brands</span> and reached a deal to sell chicken operations in Mexico and Brazil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European shares declined, with the Stoxx Europe 600 shedding 0.2% to 341.34. Poor U.S. data and concerns over looming sanctions against Russia overshadowed largely upbeat corporate earnings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russian assets also retreated. Moscow's Micex index tumbled 1.9. Bankia, Spain's largest nationalized bank, rose 1.3% after reporting that its quarterly net profit nearly doubled as loan losses fell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">French dairy group <span class="companylink">Danone</span> climbed 0.9% on news it is in talks to sell its medical nutrition business to U.S. firm Hospira, in a deal that could be valued at about $5 billion. Hospira shares rose 2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Aberdeen Asset Management</span> dropped 5.3% after the U.K. firm posted a decline in assets under management.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Pending Home Sales Slip in June; Housing Recovery Remains Choppy Despite Retreat in Interest Rates</span>
</div><div class="author">By Josh Mitchell </div><div>559 words</div><div>28 July 2014</div><div>06:05</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—The number of contracts signed to buy previously-owned homes slipped in June, a sign the housing recovery remains choppy despite a retreat in interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An index of pending home sales, reflecting purchases under contract but not yet closed, fell 1.1% to a reading of 102.7 in June from May, ending three months of gains, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Monday. The above-100 reading indicates market activity was still "average," if not robust, the trade group said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had forecast a 0.5% rise in June sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with a year ago, pending-home sales were down 7.3% last month. That suggests many Americans remain unwilling or unable to enter the market despite historically low borrowing costs and a pickup in job creation. Lenders are still imposing strict lending standards, and home prices have risen sharply over the past two years. Meanwhile, Americans' incomes are growing tepidly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist, said sales conditions have improved since the winter as price gains have eased and more homes have come on the market. "However, supply shortages still exist in parts of the country, wages are flat, and tight credit conditions are deterring a higher number of potential buyers from fully taking advantage of lower interest rates," Mr. Yun said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending home sales offers a particularly fresh look at the market because it measures contract signings, which occur weeks or even months before sales become final.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other recent reports have sent mixed signals on the direction of the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR's closely watched measure of existing-home sales—which measure sales after contracts close—climbed last month to the highest level since October, the trade group said last week. Those sales, which reflect roughly 90% of the market, have risen for three straight months but remain below the year-ago level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But sales of newly built homes fell 8.1% in June from the prior month, the Commerce Department said last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market had been a catalyst for the broader U.S. economy starting in 2012 but cooled last year after mortgage rates started to rise. Rates this year have fallen, and the market has shown some progress in recent months. But it has yet to regain its earlier momentum, despite the onset of the spring selling season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday's report showed pending sales in June fell 2.9% in the Northeast region, rose 1.1% in the Midwest, fell 2.4% in the South and were mostly flat in the West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest rates could influence the direction of the market. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage has hovered slightly above 4% since the spring and stood at 4.13% this week, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. That is down from roughly 4.5% at the start of 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But rates are expected to rise as the economy improves and the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> withdraws its support for the economy. The Fed has signaled it will end a bond buying program in October and likely raise short-term interest rates some time in 2015. The Fed has kept rates near zero throughout the recovery to stimulate spending, hiring and investment.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Eric Morath and Kris Hudson   </div><div>1057 words</div><div>25 July 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for new homes slowed sharply during the first half, a development that threatens to reverberate beyond the housing market and throughout the broader economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new single-family homes fell 4.9% through the first six months of the year compared with the same period of 2013, according to Commerce Department data released Thursday. June sales fell 8.1% from the prior month, and the May number was revised down from the best figure in six years to not even the best figure in six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Burns, chief executive of a housing-research firm that bears his name, posits that shell shock from the real-estate bust, mounting student-loan debt and last year's steep increase in new-home prices continues to deter buyers. "I just think there's a real lack of confidence to buy a home and take on a mortgage right now, which is really hurting the housing market," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lack of vigor in the new-home sector could have wide ramifications for the economy heading into the year's second half, weighing on economic growth and job creation in the well-paying construction sector. Home construction was a major employment and growth engine before the recession -- historically accounting for 5% of the U.S. economy, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>. That figure has fallen to about 3% in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After slumping from 2006 to mid-2009, spending on home building and improvements added to gross domestic product during much of the recovery. That trend has reversed. A first-quarter pullback in residential investment contributed to the overall economy contracting at a 2.9% pace. The initial estimate of second-quarter growth is due out next week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Housing has clearly been a notable area of persistent sluggishness beyond early-year weather disruptions," said Ted Wieseman, an economist at <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main impediments to home construction have shifted in the past year to weakness in demand rather than supply. Since 2011, builders' major concerns were a lack of lots ready for construction and labor shortages. As demand increased, they focused on building a limited number of homes but selling them at higher prices, which allowed them to boost profit margins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, several factors have combined to hamper demand. Rising property values brought more existing homes to the market, creating cheaper competition for new homes. Sales of previously owned homes rose for the third straight month in June, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said earlier this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steep price increases in the past two years put new homes out of reach for some buyers. The $273,500 median price of a new home in June is 17.6% higher than two years earlier and 22% more than the June median price for an existing home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while job growth has picked up, wage gains remain tepid and mortgage-qualification standards too strict for many would-be buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The absence of momentum in new-home sales heading into the third quarter, along with no improvement in mortgage applications and still-tight lending standards "raise serious questions about the state of the housing market going forward," said <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span> economist Yelena Shulyatyeva.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sonal Basu, a <span class="companylink">Redfin Corp</span>. real-estate agent covering Alameda and Contra Costa counties in the San Francisco Bay Area, said new-home sales have slowed in her market. "Buyers are priced out of the [new-home] market, and there is more inventory on the resale side for them to choose from, as well," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weaker demand for new homes could curtail construction-employment gains. A slowdown in hiring there would be a concern because those jobs tend to pay more than positions in retail and food services. In the second quarter, the economy added 94,000 retail jobs and 51,000 construction positions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> calculates that, for every single family home constructed, three full-time jobs are created for a year. Half of those jobs are in construction and the other half in related industries such as manufacturing of construction goods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jobs in residential building have increased 2.6% so far this year, outpacing a 1% gain in overall employment. But with signs that building is slowing, the pace of hiring could be difficult to maintain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of overall hiring has strengthened this year, with employers adding better than 200,000 jobs for five consecutive months, but the gains have yet to translate into better pay for many Americans. Wage growth has only kept pace with inflation during much of the recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The labor market may be getting better but wage gains are not and until that happens, families will not be buying new homes at any great pace," said Joel Naroff, president of consulting firm <span class="companylink">Naroff Economic Advisors Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> policy makers have expressed frustration about the housing sector's lackluster recovery. "While this sector has recovered notably from its earlier trough, housing activity leveled off in the wake of last year's increase in mortgage rates, and readings this year have, overall, continued to be disappointing," <span class="companylink">Fed</span> Chairwoman Janet Yellen said earlier this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One bright spot: While <span class="companylink">PulteGroup Inc</span>. on Thursday reported a 2% decline in sales contracts for its second quarter from a year earlier, CEO Richard Dugas Jr. noted the builder sees early signs of a revival among entry-level buyers. Those buyers have been largely sidelined in recent years due to stringent mortgage-qualification standards and tepid job and wage growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We remain optimistic about overall conditions and very encouraged about demand in the first half of the year," he said on a call with investors on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Toronto-based Mattamy Homes, which sold 1,400 homes last year in the U.S., said sales in 2014 have so far failed to meet expectations. Mattamy's U.S. sales in June were down more than 10% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The U.S. housing market is being held back," Mattamy's Chief Operating Officer Brian Johnston said. Purchasing a new home is "not as desirable as it used to be, given that so many people got burned by buying a new house" when their investment was decimated in the downturn.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Josh Barbanel   </div><div>845 words</div><div>25 July 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A15</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hamptons real-estate market is far more than beach-front mansions for billionaires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An uptick in deals for lower-priced homes along the storied South Fork of Long Island -- mostly by bargain hunting second-home buyers -- has pushed up the number of sales there to their highest point since 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even on the island's North Fork, a quieter and more-affordable alternative that is a short drive from the Hamptons, buyers have stepped up activity, and prices have been rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second quarter is the peak selling season on the east end of Long Island, and new market reports celebrate homes priced below $1 million that are moving quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You don't have to be a millionaire to buy a second home on the East End," said Dottie Herman, president of Douglas Elliman, a real-estate firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While prices on the most expensive headline-generating homes have risen to record levels, brokers say, lower-priced houses are still more affordable than they were during the last real-estate boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report by <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> released on Thursday noted 700 sales during the second quarter -- 3.7% above the same quarter in 2013. It is the most sales since the second quarter of 2005, when 786 homes traded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan Miller, an appraiser and president of Miller Samuel Inc., attributed a rise in sales to "an expansion of entry-level homes, defining entry level as prices below $1 million."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the second quarter, Mr. Miller said, the number of below-$1 million sales rose 6.6% compared with the year-earlier quarter and were the highest since he began tracking such sales in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roger Blaugh, a <span class="companylink">Corcoran Group</span> broker who is handling the sale of a contemporary house on a canal in East Quogue listed for $999,500, said many properties were priced below $1 million, and some for far less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He recently helped a buyer, a year-round resident, snag a 1960s ranch house on two-thirds of an acre near Southampton Village. The house was listed at $539,000. "Affordability plays a big factor in the market overall," he said, "even though all the talk seems to be about the mansions and the $30 million price tag."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price in the Hamptons, $908,500, remained 17% below the peak prices during the boom, according to the Elliman report. It was also just below the $910,000 median price for a Manhattan apartment during the same quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As sales of lower-priced home rose, the median Hamptons sale price was down 1.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the North Fork, the median home price of a home was just over half that of a Hamptons home -- $477,500 -- and remained 21% below the 2008 peak. Nevertheless, it up 3.9% from the same quarter a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ernest Cervi, a Corcoran managing director who is based in Bridgehampton, said that Corcoran data showed a significant increase in sales in the North Fork in the second quarter, as new buyers, first-time or second-time home buyers move into the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said interest rates remained attractive, economic indicators were positive and some buyers worried prices might begin to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traditionally, the North Fork and Hamptons markets have been separate. In part, that reflected the areas' contrasts: the ocean-splashed Hamptons, summertime playground to celebrities and old-money families, versus the North Fork, a more sedate and modest string of communities, many with vineyards, bounded by Long Island Sound and Peconic Bay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as prices in the Hamptons rose sharply during the boom, many buyers were priced out. Meanwhile, the North Fork became more appealing with added amenities, from restaurants to high-end retailing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, many lower-priced homes need renovation and not all neighborhoods have been seeing a sales surge. Thomas Uhlinger, a <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> broker based in Mattituck, has a three-bedroom home in Cutchogue on the North Fork, with a dock on a creek, listed for $895,000 that has been on the market for many months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said buyers were looking "but not taking a swing," since inventory was plentiful and rising. But he said many buyers were realizing the North Fork was undervalued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, he said most summer buyers came from Manhattan, but now there was a new trend, as younger, successful buyers in their 30s are looking over the East End: "A lot from Brooklyn are coming in," he said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Eric Morath and Kris Hudson   </div><div>786 words</div><div>25 July 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>7</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market for newly built homes weakened in the first half of the year, a development that is likely to impede economic growth and could hold back job creation in the well-paying construction sector in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new single-family homes fell 4.9% through the first six months of the year, compared with the same period of 2013, according to Commerce Department data released Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">June sales fell 8.1% from May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 406,000. Meanwhile, May sales were revised down to a rate of 442,000 from a previously estimated 504,000. The initial May reading would have been the strongest pace since the recovery began, but the revised figure isn't even the best of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The absence of momentum in new-home sales heading into the third quarter, along with no improvement in mortgage applications and still-tight lending standards, "raise serious questions about the state of the housing market going forward," said <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span> economist Yelena Shulyatyeva.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest numbers show home building -- a major employment and growth engine prior the recession -- is still struggling to find its footing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential investment, including home building and improvements, had added to gross-domestic-product gains for 12 straight quarters before declining the last two. The first-quarter pullback contributed to the overall economy contracting at a 2.9% pace. The initial estimate of second-quarter GDP is due next week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of newly built homes account for about 10% of U.S. home-buying activity, and month-to-month changes in the data can be volatile. Over the longer run, sales began to tumble in 2006 after topping 1.2 million the prior year. The market didn't bottom out until early 2011, well after the most recent recession ended. The sales pace then grew modestly for about two years before slipping again in the second half of 2013, when mortgage interest rates began to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest data suggest a continuation of a lackluster recovery. From a year earlier, new-home sales were down 11.5% in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builder Mattamy Homes, which sold 1,400 homes last year in five states, said sales in 2014 have so far failed to meet expectations. Mattamy's U.S. sales in June were more than 10% less than a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The U.S. housing market is being held back," Mattamy's Chief Operating Officer Brian Johnston said before Thursday's report. Purchasing a new home is "not as desirable as it used to be, given that so many people got burned by buying a new house" when their investment was decimated in the downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of homes on the market is increasing. There was a 5.8-month supply of new homes on the market at the end of last month, up from a 5.2-month inventory at the end of April. Thursday's report showed new-home sales fell across the country, with the sharpest decline in the Northeast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders reported varying sales results for June, a month in which sales typically decline modestly on an unadjusted basis from the traditionally strong month of May. Builders in Texas and other states with strong job growth reported robust sales. But those spanning multiple states noted a continued lack of confidence among buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quarterly results varied among national builders on Thursday. But <span class="companylink">PulteGroup Inc</span>. noted a glimmer of hope in the challenging market: early signs of a revival of first-time buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pulte noted that sales at its <span class="companylink">Centex</span> entry-level brand increased by 26% in the quarter from a year earlier on a per-community basis. Pulte executives called the <span class="companylink">Centex</span> gains a sign of "broadening improvement" for the first-time segment that warrants watching to see if it continues. Entry-level buyers have been largely sidelined in recent years due to stringent mortgage-qualification standards and tepid wage growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Burns, chief executive of housing research and consultancy John Burns Real Estate Consulting Inc. in Irvine, Calif., said his firm's June survey of 228 builder representatives found a 3% seasonally adjusted decline in new sales contracts in June from May, and a 5% decline from June 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Burns posits that shell shock from the real-estate bust, mounting student-loan debt and last year's steep increase in new-home prices continue to deter buyers. "I just think there's a real lack of confidence to buy a home and take on a mortgage right now, which is really hurting the housing market," he said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anna Prior </div><div>383 words</div><div>24 July 2014</div><div>03:22</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PulteGroup Inc. said its second-quarter earnings improved as the home builder reported slightly higher revenue boosted by higher average selling prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Pulte's new orders fell 2.2% from a year earlier to 4,778 homes, though the value of net new orders for the period increased 5% to $1.6 billion. Closings, meanwhile, fell 9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As one of the nation's largest builders, Pulte's sales are typically considered to be a strong barometer for the sector because the company constructs everything from entry-level homes to units for retirees nationwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders have also benefited from a low supply of existing-home inventory in recent periods, although recent data was weaker than expected. Housing starts sank a seasonally adjusted 9.3% in June amid wet weather in the South, while residential housing permits, an indicator of future construction plans, were down 4.2%, according to the Commerce Department. Analysts, however, had indicated that June's results were likely a temporary departure from a trend of recovery in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our view of the U.S. housing market remains positive, as improvements in both the economy and employment provide ongoing support to an industry already benefiting from low inventory, low mortgage rates, better pricing and favorable demographic trends, said Richard J. Dugas Jr., PulteGroup chairman and chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, Pulte reported a profit of $41.9 million, or 11 cents a share, up from $36.4 million, or nine cents a share, a year earlier. The latest quarter's results included income tax expense of $26 million—compared with prior-year income tax expense of $2 million—as well as $88 million charges tied to insurance reserves and office relocation costs. The year-ago quarter included $67 million of charges resulting from a contractual dispute, debt repurchases and corporate relocation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total revenue edged up 0.5% to $1.29 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had predicted earnings of 25 cents a share on revenue of $1.33 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-building cost of revenue fell 5.1%. Home-sale gross margin rose 480 basis points to 23.6%. The average selling price rose 12% to $328,000. </p>

</div><div class="author">By Anna Prior </div><div>302 words</div><div>24 July 2014</div><div>03:55</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">D.R. Horton Inc. said its fiscal third-quarter profit fell despite strong home-building revenue and an increase in new sales orders, as the home builder recorded impairment charges tied to assets in the Chicago area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chicago housing market remains weak, with sales absorptions and returns in these communities performing below management's expectations, the company said. During the quarter, D.R. Horton took actions to increase sales pace, reduce inventories and improve cash flows in those communities, which results in a $54.7 million impairment charge during the quarter, the company added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">D.R. Horton, one of the nation's largest home-building companies, has long been a favorite with industry analysts because its management team avoids risk and it constructs low-price homes accessible to many buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the latest quarter, D.R. Horton reported earnings of $113.1 million, or 32 cents a share, down from $146 million, or 42 cents a share, a year earlier. The latest quarter's results included the inventory impairment charges, primarily related to active communities in the Midwest region in Chicago that were purchased from 2004 to 2007 and had been previously impaired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-building revenue climbed 28% to $2.10 billion. Net sales orders increased 32% in value to $2.4 billion and 25% in homes to 8,551.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected earnings of 49 cents a share on revenue of $2.09 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the quarter, D.R. Horton said home closings rose 28% in value to $2.1 billion, while the number of homes closed climbed 19% to 7,676.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company also said its board has increased its quarterly cash dividend by 67% to 6.25 cents a share. </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A broad measure of U.S. home sales climbed for the third consecutive month in June, hitting the highest level since October as the housing market gained steam after a monthslong slump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes rose 2.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.04 million last month, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Tuesday. Revisions showed May sales reached a 4.91 million rate, up from an initially reported 4.89 million pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest rise suggests the housing market rebounded from a harsh winter and that slowing price growth, coupled with expanding inventory, could set the market up for future gains. "We are seeing a more broad-based recovery," said Lawrence Yun, the Realtor trade group's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday's report showed home prices are growing more slowly than in prior months as more homes come on the market. The median sale price for a home last month was $223,300, up 4.3% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of homes available for sale climbed 6.5% from a year earlier. At the current pace, it would take 5.5 months to exhaust the supply, close to what economists consider a balanced market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason sales haven't reached year-ago levels is that fewer investors are entering the market, Mr. Yun said. The share of June sales going to investors was flat at about 16%, down from 19% just two years ago. As a result, purchases of "distressed" properties -- such as those in foreclosure -- slipped as a share of overall sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time buyers are growing slightly, but at 28% of all buyers, they remain a historically small part of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the latest gains, the market hasn't regained its earlier momentum. Compared with a year earlier, sales were down 2.3% last month. At the current pace, sales are roughly at the level they were in 2000, even though the U.S. population has grown, the economy has more jobs and interest rates remain historically low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales make up roughly 90% of all home purchases. Home sales were robust in 2012 and the first half of 2013, underpinning the U.S. recovery. But sales slowed in the middle of last year as a rise in mortgage rates and a run-up in prices likely scared away some prospective buyers. Harsh winter weather also likely sapped activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowing rates have fallen this year, likely helping to boost sales in the crucial spring selling season. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage fell to 4.13% last week, below year-ago levels, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, clouds loom. The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> has signaled it will end its bond-buying stimulus program in October; those bond purchases are credited with pushing down interest rates. A rise in interest rates, as anticipated, would raise the cost of purchasing a home at a time when Americans' incomes are growing meekly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Without a better pace of income growth, any increase in mortgage rates. . .will take a bite out of home sales," said Richard Moody, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Regions Financial Corp</span>. "So, while June's report is encouraging, the real test will be whether or not improving sales will be sustained over coming months."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. home construction tumbled in June due to a stretch of wet weather in the South, a decline that analysts said was likely a temporary departure from a trend of recovery in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts sank 9.3% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 893,000. It was the weakest showing since September 2013 and the second-straight monthly drop, the Commerce Department said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The June decline was driven by a nearly 30% drop in the South, the largest monthly decrease on record for that part of the country. Other parts of the U.S., however, posted increases. Construction in the Midwest was up 28%, while the Northeast was up 14%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem in the South, home builders say, is that the region's unusually wet winter and spring limited the number of home lots ready for construction. By June, a shortage of such build-ready lots left several builders unable to start constructing enough homes to meet demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some builders also mentioned that municipal permitting processes are taking longer this year, perhaps due to short staffing in city building departments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've had such a wet winter that the development cycle has elongated," said Terry Russell, chief executive of Atlanta-based builder FrontDoor Communities, which anticipates selling 175 homes this year in Georgia and South Carolina. "It's at least two or three months longer [to develop a home lot], and that has a significant impact on starts."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brad Hunter, chief economist at home-building research firm Metrostudy, part of <span class="companylink">Hanley Wood LLC</span>, said the lot-shortage issue spans several Southern states. Other U.S. regions saw little drop-off in their regular production cycles because they don't typically build much through the winter, but the South does. Thus, the South's slowdown in lot development in the winter and spring is slowing its summer construction starts in relation to past years, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowdown in the South -- defined as a huge region stretching from Maryland to Texas to Florida -- could result in a pickup in starts later in the summer, analysts said. Within the South, data from the National Weather Service point to a particularly wet spring in Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana and Alabama, among others. Texas, meanwhile, remains in a drought.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eric Green, global head of research for <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span>, called the overall report "exceptionally uneven and on balance is not an indication of a significant turn in housing construction."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report contained a few silver linings: For the entire second quarter, construction of single-family homes was up 4% from a year ago, compared with a 2% yearly decline for the first three months of the year. Permits for single-family homes were up 2.6% from the prior month and housing starts were up 7.5% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the pace of construction for May was revised lower, showing a 7.3% decline, compared with an initially reported 6.5% decrease, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And new applications for building permits, a bellwether of future construction, declined 4.2% in June from the prior month to a pace of 963,000, the lowest figure since January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline in construction in June was driven by a 9% drop in single-family homes and a nearly 10% drop in apartments and condominiums with at least two units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among builders, perspectives are varied on the state of the new-home market. <span class="companylink">Drees Co</span>., a closely held builder based in Fort Mitchell, Ky., started construction of 140 homes last month, down 2% from May and down 8% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Williams, finance chief at Drees, attributed the drop in starts to weak sales, slower permitting by municipalities and tepid consumer confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National builder <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>. said during its quarterly call with investors last month that a pickup in construction for single-family homes will depend on whether mortgage lenders relax their standards. But rival <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> said during its quarterly call that it has seen encouraging signs, such as the return of first-time buyers in certain markets with strong job growth.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Siobhan Hughes </div><div>851 words</div><div>15 July 2014</div><div>13:36</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—<span class="companylink">The House</span> on Tuesday passed a $10.8 billion measure to pay the federal government's share of road and bridge repairs for the next 10 months, a step that would delay until next year the tougher question of how to shore up the trust fund as spending outpaces revenues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The House voted 367-55 to pass the measure as time was running short to replenish the Highway Trust Fund, which covers about a quarter of the nation's spending on highway and mass-transit programs and will be insolvent next month unless <span class="companylink">Congress</span> acts. The Transportation Department projects it will have to slow reimbursements to the states, delaying projects and eliminating jobs during the summer construction season, if Congress fails to deliver more money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">The Senate</span> is expected to take up the highway legislation before the August recess.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The White House supports the package, but earlier on Tuesday President Barack Obama chastised lawmakers for coming up with a small-scale patch, saying Congress "shouldn't pat itself on the back for averting disaster for a few months, kicking the can down the road for a few months, careening from crisis to crisis when it comes to something as basic as our infrastructure."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His comments, at the Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center in McLean, Va., a federal facility investigating technology for safer, more efficient roads, were part of a broader strategy to put pressure on Congress to focus their energy on infrastructure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawmakers on both the left and the right complained that the short-term fix relied on budget gimmicks. The bulk of the money for the 10-month patch would come from a tactic known as pension smoothing, which allows companies to temporarily reduce pension contributions. The tactic raises revenue for the government because companies lose out on tax deductions associated with pension contributions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other budget maneuvers include transferring $1 billion from a fund used to cover cleanup costs from leaking underground storage tanks, and a one-year extension, until 2024, of fees for processing passengers and vehicles through customs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Congress can do better—and America needs better," said Rep. Peter Welch (D., Vt.), who went further than other Democrats in expressing his dissatisfaction by voting against the bill. "This gimmick of pension smoothing is about creating a pothole in the pension system in order to fix a pothole on the highway."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said his vote was "a protest" against "this habit that's getting worse" of coming up with short-term fixes by using methods unrelated to highway funding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rep. John Fleming (R., La.), who said he reluctantly voted for the bill, also complained that it "borrows money from the future to pay bills today."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the criticism, though, the vote for the measure was overwhelming, reflecting a desire by members in both parties to avoid deep cuts in transportation spending during the summer construction season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the frustration expressed before Tuesday's vote was over the fact that the bill was temporary. But putting together a long-term highway bill will be a much bigger and more divisive fight over how to fund the programs in the long term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans, support increasing the 18.4 cents-per-gallon gasoline tax, which Congress hasn't increased since 1993, while others are weighing whether to switch to a different system altogether that would charge motorists based on the distance they drive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More conservative members balk at raising taxes and say that Congress simply needs to do a better job prioritizing spending. Another idea that has picked up bipartisan support is a plan from Rep. John Delaney (D., Md.) to set up a fund financed by businesses in exchange for repatriating money from overseas on a tax-free basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Either way, Congress will have to address the problem. Last month, the <span class="companylink">Congressional Budget Office</span> projected that if gasoline and diesel tax rates remain the same, spending would exceed revenue by $167 billion over the decade through 2024.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R., Mich.) said that he would have preferred a long-term package but, with no deal in sight, a short-term measure lasting through May would give Congress enough time to construct a new plan without jeopardizing transportation projects during the current construction season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This won't be an easy task so it's important that Congress has time to have a deliberative, open process rather than trying to hit Americans who are already paying more for gas with a gas-tax hike," Mr. Camp said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This Congress has refused to address its responsibilities," Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D., Ore.) said, complaining that the hopes of a solution would be no better in 10 months. "We will be no better off next May to resolve this question. In fact we will be worse off because we'll be in the middle of a presidential campaign, with a new Congress."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Candace Taylor   </div><div>1239 words</div><div>11 July 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problems started the first night Bob Morris and Ira Silverberg moved into their West Village co-op apartment in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Almost immediately, there was a thundering sound above us," Mr. Morris said. The footfalls of the family upstairs were so heavy they could feel the vibrations, he said. And while he was complaining about the late-night noise, his downstairs neighbor complained about him, saying she could hear him snoring. Sometimes, she banged on her ceiling with a broomstick.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When such problems arise, "your heart sinks," Mr. Morris said. "You just bought this place that you think is so beautiful. You don't listen long enough while you're looking to understand what the sound situation is."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After months of back-and-forth talks with the neighbors, the couple hired Manhattan-based City Soundproofing to replace their ceilings. The cost? About $30,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past, many urbanites accepted noisy neighbors, and neighborhoods, as part of life in the city. But homeowners are becoming more demanding about their homes and less tolerant of intrusions. "People spend a lot of money on an apartment; when they get home, they don't want to hear their neighbors' techno music," said Benjamin Sachwald, vice president and director of acoustics, noise and vibration at AKRF, a New York consulting, engineering and planning firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As formerly industrial areas are reborn as residential neighborhoods, the characteristics many home buyers prize -- floor-to-ceiling windows, open layouts and proximity to public transportation -- can make them more vulnerable to noise. And in today's high-tech homes, mechanical noises -- from heating and cooling systems, elevators, spa filters and pumps, wine-cellar compressors and media-room units -- also cause unwanted noise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers are pouring money into new buildings to combat the problem. At Oceana Bal Harbour in Florida, for example, developers are pitching the condos as having an acoustical rating above local requirements for noise limits. "Soundproofing is one of the characteristics that high-end buyers look for," said Marcos Corti Maderna, CEO at Consultatio Real Estate, North America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Argentina-based developer is spending more than $2 million to envelop the exterior of the building in three layers of glass -- two laminated layers separated from a layer of impact glass by an inch-thick pocket of air -- rather than the single layer typical in Miami-area residential buildings. All the flooring will consist of a 10-inch concrete slab topped by a rubber mat, and insulation will be added between floors and ceilings. Pipes will have springs, and rubber hangers and gaskets to still vibrations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps most significantly, Mr. Maderna added, the company will set the building about 350 feet back from Collins Avenue, rather than the required 100 feet. That means "sacrificing square footage," he said, but is worth it to appeal to luxury buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Charles condo building in Manhattan, developer <span class="companylink">Bluerock Real Estate</span> also installed triple-paned windows -- in the apartments facing busy First Avenue -- and took care to cut noise from heating and cooling systems, said Phil Mendlow, a senior vice president at Bluerock. "It's important for developers to carefully abate the noise generated by the plethora of mechanical equipment in these buildings," he said. "If it's not done right, it can be pretty annoying."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soundproofing solutions can range from the simple -- installing carpeting to help muffle sound -- to the high-tech -- putting in so-called floating floors, which aren't rigidly connected to the building structure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Morris's building, built in the early 1970s, has a wooden joist system that lets sounds travel between apartments, said Mason Wyatt, founder of City Soundproofing. When adding carpeting and vinyl padding didn't eliminate the noise, the couple called City Soundproofing. The company replaced the ceilings with two layers of drywall surrounded by a paint-like substance called Green Glue, a viscoelastic polymer. Such damping compounds reduce vibrations and, thus, noise, Mr. Wyatt said. He also sealed the ceiling with acoustical caulk and put in "isolation clips," or fasteners that act as shock absorbers, to further curb vibrations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best solution to noise problems is to avoid them in the first place. San Francisco-based architect and soundproofing expert W. David Seidel said that before buying a home, potential residents should visit at different times of day, "when the neighbors' units come to life with kids and parents returning from school or work." Even better is to ask to make a 24-hour recording of the space that will pick up anything unusual, "such as violin practice that starts at 10 p.m. or a flight pattern that changes in the early morning."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Designer Bob Novogratz and his wife, Cortney, bought their home in Manhattan's West Village five years ago for about $10 million, demolishing the two-story building that was on the property and building a five-story, five-bedroom, 7,200-square-foot townhouse with an elevator and roof deck. To take advantage of Hudson River views, the couple installed custom-made, floor-to-ceiling windows on nearly every floor. They soon realized those windows made audible the constant hum of traffic from nearby West Side Highway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is a common problem in homes with large windows, Mr. Novogratz said. "The rule is, the bigger the window, the more noise," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So they added a third pane of glass to windows on the west-facing wall, to the tune of $100,000. The hefty price tag was worth it, Mr. Novogratz said, especially where the resale value is concerned. The home is now on the market with Town Residential and <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> for $21.5 million. "If someone's going to pay $20 million, it has to be perfect," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Melanie Dunea and Nigel Parry's loft is on a cobblestone street in Tribeca, in a building constructed in the late 1800s as a warehouse for paper storage. When they first saw the condo, the couple loved it for the bright, open layout and the 7-foot windows overlooking a canopy of trees around the Holland Tunnel exit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I remember thinking how glorious it was to see trees," said Ms. Dunea. But as they discovered after moving in, they had underestimated the traffic noise. Worse, they also found sounds traveled easily into their bedroom from the apartment above.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We could hear every single thing upstairs was doing," Mr. Parry said. For one, they were awakened nearly every day by the neighbor's alarm clock -- especially annoying because both Ms. Dunea and Mr. Parry are freelance photographers who work irregular hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After several months, they hired a soundproofing company. Based on the company's recommendation, the couple dropped the ceiling in their bedroom about a foot -- covering the original beams -- to allow the installation of foam and other soundproofing materials. They also covered the exposed brick behind their bed with Sheetrock. Finally, the couple hired a company called CitiQuiet to install a third layer of glass on the bedroom windows. They estimated total costs at about $30,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"After that, it was very peaceful," Ms. Dunea said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—<span class="companylink">Congress</span> struggled to engineer a plan to inject more money into the fund that covers the federal share of road, bridge and mass-transit spending amid a dispute over whether a temporary fix should extend into next year after midterm elections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden (D., Ore.) missed a self-imposed deadline to release a new version of a highway bill, leaving at risk his plans to clear the measure through his committee this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some Republicans on Mr. Wyden's panel, meanwhile, threw their weight behind an alternative devised by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R., Mich.) .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Camp's bill would fund the Highway Trust Fund through May 2015. Mr. Wyden has sought to provide money for the fund through the end of 2014, to buy time for Congress to this year pass a multiyear highway bill that would put federal highway spending on more solid financial footing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) said the House was likely to vote on Mr. Camp's legislation next week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking to reporters, Mr. Camp argued for a highway-spending bill that lasted through most of the spring season, saying the construction industry needs to be able to use the winter to plan for construction projects when the weather improves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you end at the calendar year, that means you're not prepared for the next construction season," Mr. Camp told reporters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Democrats complained that extending the temporary fix into next year would simply delay agreement on a multiyear bill to fund road and bridge repairs to next year. Next year will be the start of a new Congress determined by the November elections, when Republicans have the potential to regain control of <span class="companylink">the Senate</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's no reason to think that punting on this issue to the next Congress yet again will magically yield a different outcome," said Tom Carper (D., Del.), a member of the Senate Finance Committee. "Kick the can down the road hasn't served us well."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fight between the two committees masked a series of smaller, intraparty disagreements over the highway bill. Sen. Bob Corker (R., Tenn.) on Wednesday criticized Mr. Camp's bill as "budget gimmickry," complaining that by turning to funding sources such as allowing companies to delay contributions to pensions, lawmakers were engaging in "political cowardice."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Josie Cox and Tommy Stubbington   </div><div>644 words</div><div>8 July 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>22</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European stocks fell Monday after weaker-than-expected German industrial data encouraged investors to take profit on last week's gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Stoxx Europe 600 index shed 0.9% to 344.80, following a 1.7% gain last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Germany's <span class="companylink">DAX</span> fell 1% to 9906.07. Data showed that industrial production in the country declined in May at the sharpest rate since April 2012, weighed down by a fall in both manufacturing and construction output.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That led <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>' economists to trim their outlook for second-quarter German gross domestic product to a quarter-on-quarter increase of just 0.1% from a rise of 0.4% previously.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In light of these weak monthly figures, it is likely that industrial production has declined markedly in the second quarter overall," economist Thomas Harjes wrote in a note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lee Hardman, a currency economist at <span class="companylink">Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi</span> UFJ, wrote in a note that this was a further signal that Europe's economic recovery remains "relatively weak and fragile," which is unlikely to prompt investors to reassess the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span>'s currently dovish policy stance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the ECB council kept its main lending rate at 0.15% and maintained a -0.1% rate on bank funds deposited with the central bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates will stay at current levels for "an extended period," ECB President Mario Draghi said at a news conference.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everyone knows that the health of the American economy depends a lot on housing starts. If the home-building industry is not doing well, the economy is failing. Life in these United States is a zero-sum game. We are all in this thing together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I hate being all in this thing together. Or let's just say, I hate being all in this thing together with the home-construction industry. Right now, a McMansion the size of the Louvre is going up directly across the street from my house. Nine other monstrosities are also being deployed in what was once a beautiful, empty meadow. The field has been filled with backhoes and earth movers and building materials on and off for at least two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The projects, once begun, take forever to finish. The crew starts work on a house, then gets dispatched to finish another project in a different town, and then comes back. So it takes months to get the micro-chateaux built. It's like watching someone set fire to your neighborhood, then douse it, then come back and start the fire again six weeks later. You'd rather they just ruined things once and for all and got it over with. If you're going to sack Rome, sack it. Drilling, digging, dust and leveled trees have been our reality since 2011. It makes it very, very hard to root for the home builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I am constantly reading that young people are not buying houses at the pace needed to get the economy percolating. Well, maybe someone should tell the developers to stop building lurid, vile houses that no one can afford. Or to stop building lurid, vile, prefab, ticky-tacky houses even if people can afford them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the economy cratered in 2008 and my 401(k) got massacred, I wasn't as upset as I should have been because it meant that the McMansions scheduled to be erected across the street wouldn't get built until the recession was over. Four happy years ensued, without bogus cathedral windows and four-car garages and faux-Belgian cobblestones and Philistines for neighbors. This situation put me in the uncomfortable position of having to root against my own country. As long as the housing industry was flat on its back, life was good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I really wish that the economy were not so dependent upon the health of home builders. I would love to root for these guys. I really would. But they build trash. They tear down adorable bungalows and build McMansions in Princeton, N.J. In Chicago, in Boston, in Los Angeles and even in little old Easton, Pa., they are bulldozing whatever stands in their way and throwing up their eyesores. Throwing up being the operative term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike the car guys, who build products that give me pleasure, or the pizzeria makers, who bake tasty pizza, or the clothing industry, which makes snappy shirts, fantastic trousers, fabulous anoraks and some pretty nifty chapeaus, the housing industry builds malignant, socially corrosive, architecturally putrescent stuff that I hate. The house-building folks fall into the same category as the leaf-blower, the weed-whacker and post-office guys. Ugh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I dream of an America whose national well-being would depend upon the health of the latte industry, the antivirus industry, perhaps even the flavored-cigar industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The <span class="companylink">Dow</span> rose 170 points today, buoyed by positive news from the apps industry" is news I want to hear. "Craft vermouth startups grew at a 5.6% pace in August" would also be terrific. Ditto: "The squid ink pasta industry is coming back with a roar!"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But frankly, I don't expect this to happen. Americans are a band of brothers. In my neck of the woods, a band of <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span>.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Lucy Craymer </div><div>1002 words</div><div>2 July 2014</div><div>22:55</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WELLINGTON, New Zealand—As New Zealand gears up for a hard-fought election, an issue that typically confronts troubled economies has crept onto the agenda of this largely prosperous nation—immigration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Sept. 20 approaches, parties across the political spectrum are busy crafting anti-immigration policies that they hope will lure voters. Among the proposals are a clampdown on foreign visas and a plan to restrict property investment by forcing newcomers to live in small regional towns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sudden upsurge in nationalistic fervor is usually associated with economies that are in the doldrums, where immigrants are targeted by groups or individuals with frustrated ambitions. The euro zone's economic woes have allowed more nationalistic, or "euroskeptic" parties, to gain ground in recent elections, for example.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Zealand's economy, though, is anything but troubled. The South Pacific nation, with a population of 4.5 million, is outperforming most major economies thanks to booming demand in Asia for the country's meat and dairy exports. The economy has outpaced the U.K. and U.S. in recent years; it grew by a healthy 3.3% in the year through March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central bank has become so convinced of the economy's health that it has started to raise interest rates. Few other developed economies have dared to raise rates since the financial crisis. New Zealand's benchmark cash-rate target has risen three times this year to 3.25%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That stellar economic performance has lured more foreigners to New Zealand. In addition, it has prompted citizens living overseas to return home and encouraged more New Zealanders to stay put in the country. As a result, the small island nation—a net exporter of migrants as little as two years ago—is experiencing its strongest immigration flows in more than a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government figures show that 3,980 more foreign nationals and New Zealanders took up residence in the country in May than emigrated—2,310 more than a year earlier. In addition, 4,690 more foreign nationals took up residence than left, 1,150 more than a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under normal circumstances, immigration would be a boon to the economy by increasing demand for local goods and services. However, the influx of new arrivals has triggered an unwelcome side effect: skyrocketing house prices, which are pushing accommodation costs beyond the reach of many ordinary New Zealanders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the <span class="companylink">Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development</span>, New Zealand has the world's fourth-most expensive housing market on a price-to-income and rent-ratio basis—pricier than the U.K., U.S. and Australia, which also has a booming property market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past year, house prices have risen 10% in Auckland, New Zealand's largest city, where the average price of a property, from studio apartments to waterfront mansions, is now 611,000 New Zealand dollars (US$535,458).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For house hunters like Natalie Sampson, a single 33-year-old teacher at an Auckland day-care center, the high prices make promises to rein in the housing market politically appealing. "It's really important they do something because there are so many people in my situation that just can't afford to buy a house," said Ms. Sampson, who has been searching unsuccessfully for an affordable property for six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Immigration is far from being the dominant worry among citizens ahead of an election dominated by concern over how to maintain the strong pace of economic growth and talk of speeding up the rebuilding of Christchurch, New Zealand's second-biggest city, which was devastated by earthquakes in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, under the country's complex proportional-representation system, where smaller parties wield considerable influence, otherwise marginal issues can assume greater importance. The New Zealand First party, which takes one of the toughest lines on immigration among its peers, could well emerge as a kingmaker in the September election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The party has called for some immigrants to be sent to live in regional towns for the first five years of their stay, so they can contribute to local economies—rather than being allowed to settle in larger cities like Auckland and Christchurch, where property prices are more of a concern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Zealand First also wants to restrict foreigners living outside New Zealand from investing in local property; the party blames the government for being too lenient in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ruling National party, which has an interest in playing down the immigration issue, has been in power for six years and remains popular. But its three coalition partners, the Maori Party, United First, and Act, have seen their popularity wane recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent opinion polls show the National party's support at just short of a majority, while backing for the main opposition parties, Labour and the Greens, is close to 40% together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labour party has said it would look at trying to halve the number of incoming migrants, as well as allowing foreign investors only to purchase new properties to help prevent a housing crisis from worsening. The center-left party's likeliest coalition partner, the Greens, support similar restrictions on offshore property investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Zealand's central bank has tried to skim the froth off the housing market recently by raising interest rates and regulating mortgage lending. However, such measures have often made it more difficult for first-time home buyers to get onto the first rung of the housing ladder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is difficult to know for sure how many nonresidents, including overseas investors, own property in New Zealand. Economists' estimate the figure could be anywhere from 3% to 20% across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Anecdotally, you would say they are the marginal buyer, but in terms of proving that, where the government falls down is in not actually having information to draw a policy conclusion from," said Chris Green, head of research at brokerage First NZ Capital.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A gauge of pending home sales jumped in May, the latest evidence that the U.S. housing recovery began to regain its footing this spring even if it isn't firing on all cylinders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>' index tracking pending sales of existing homes rose a seasonally adjusted 6.1% in May from the prior month to 103.9, the group said Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase was the index's largest monthly gain since April 2010, when home sales spiked 9.6% ahead of the expiration of a tax credit for first-time buyers of homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It looks like May was a good month for home sales. . .and many of the housing indicators we track have pointed to a pickup in the housing market over the past few months following its recent earlier slump," <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span> economist Daniel Silver said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected pending home sales to rise a more modest 1.1% in May. April's reading was raised slightly to 97.9 from the initial estimate of 97.8.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pending-sales index can be a timely measure of sales activity because it tracks home purchases when contracts are signed. Sales usually close a month or two later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending sales have risen month-over-month for three straight months. But they still were down 5.2% in May from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is important to bear in mind that with mortgage applications for home purchase not showing any signs of sustained strength. . .it is apparent that much of the juice in the existing-home sales market remains centered in all-cash purchases by speculative buyers," MFR Inc. economist Joshua Shapiro said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the sign of strength in pending sales accompanies improvements in other gauges of U.S. housing-market activity. Those indicators fell with last summer's jump in borrowing costs and slid through a harsh winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes soared a seasonally adjusted 18.6% in May to their highest level in six years, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes rose a seasonally adjusted 4.9%, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>, however, has flagged sluggishness in the housing market as a concern for the overall economy. Longer-term readings on the housing market show new-home sales were up just 0.8% in the first five months of 2014 compared with a year earlier, and existing-home sales were down 5% in May from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>' chief economist, said home sales are improving but the weak first quarter took a heavy toll. He expects 2.8% fewer sales of existing homes in 2014 compared with 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Sales should exceed an annual pace of five million homes in some of the upcoming months behind favorable mortgage rates, more inventory and improved job creation," Mr. Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"However, second-half sales growth won't be enough to compensate for the sluggish first quarter and will likely fall below last year's total."</p>

</div><div>941 words</div><div>28 June 2014</div><div>20:01</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration plans to allow consumers to automatically renew for next year the health plans and premium subsidies that they got through the Affordable Care Act's federal exchange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move, which will apply to most of the five million people who picked insurance plans through HealthCare.gov for 2014, will make it easier for consumers to stay in their plans next year and retain tax credits lowering their cost of coverage. It also will relieve pressure on the federal exchange, which was crippled during parts of its first enrollment period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Department of Health and Human Services said it would allow about 95% of people who signed up for coverage to be automatically re-enrolled if they don't return to the site to switch plans. People who don't take proactive steps to come back to the site and report changes in their income would also have their tax credits renewed based on the information the federal government has on file about them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move is likely to be welcomed by big insurers who signed up large numbers of people in the first year by offering aggressively low premiums, since they are banking on many of those consumers choosing to stick with their current coverage by default. Smaller insurers who were hoping to compete afresh for consumers, possibly by lowering their rates to undercut the bigger carriers, could be disadvantaged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supporters of the health law had feared some of the new enrollees wouldn't go back to the site for 2015, and that enrollment workers would have to scramble to reach out to those people while at the same time making a big push to sign up more uninsured individuals. Another concern was that without automatic renewal people would lose subsidies that offset their premiums significantly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 87% of the people who got coverage through HealthCare.gov also got a tax credit that offsets the cost of their premiums.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A New Look at Degrees</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As states for the first time mine certain degree data from public colleges, they are finding salaries for holders of associate degrees in technical fields are outstripping many of those with four-year degrees, at least early in a career.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The growing body of data takes a sober new look at the value of a postsecondary education in a slowly recovering economy. Overall, the findings affirm that getting a college degree is worth it. But they question the long-held faith that a four-year college degree is the surest ticket to the middle class and an associate degree is its poor country cousin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">New York Federal Reserve Bank</span> economists recently found that the annualized return on a bachelor's and associate degree has long been the same over the course of a career, about 15%. The difference in wages between the two also has remained constant: Working-age bachelor's holders with a full-time job on average make $65,800 annually, and associate's holders make $46,300.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-Home Sales Rise</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes rose 4.9% in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.89 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said. The pace was the highest since October, the last month annualized sales topped five million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coupled with an improvement in April, the May figure points to a housing market that has bounced back from a dismal winter and shows buyers are adjusting to interest rates that are up modestly from spring 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, May sales were down 5% from the year-earlier level. The recent rebound could slow if mortgage rates rise, as many economists project. Because of the sluggish start to 2014, the Realtors group expects a 3% reduction in sales this year from 2013's total of 5.09 million.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big Funds Missed Rally</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corporate pension funds and university endowments in the U.S. have missed out on much of the rally for stocks since 2009, following a push to diversify into other investments that have had disappointing performances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The institutions, ranging from <span class="companylink">General Motors</span> to <span class="companylink">Harvard University</span>, have been shifting to hedge funds, private equity and venture capital, "alternative investments" that outpaced stocks during the 2008 meltdown but have badly lagged behind the S&amp;P 500 since 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. companies with the largest defined-benefit pension plans in 2013 posted an average return of 9.9%, according to a survey of 100 large firms by Milliman, which provides actuarial products and services. The S&amp;P 500 returned 32% in 2013, including dividends.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. economy seems headed to a long-run growth rate well below 3%, but some urban areas will grow faster than 4% annually for the rest of the decade, according to a study released by the U.S. Conference of Mayors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost all the big-growth areas are in the South and West. Of the 21 highest-growth metro regions, six are in Texas and four, in Florida. Construction, energy, computer jobs and professional business services will be major sources of the growth, the study says. Heading the list is Midland, Texas, with growth projected at 5.8%, helped by agriculture, construction and mining.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest loser will be upstate New York. In the forecast, five of the 10 slowest economies will be in New York state. At the very bottom, Utica-Rome and Binghamton will grow just 1% a year through 2020.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kris Hudson and Joe Light </div><div>826 words</div><div>25 June 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales soared in May, but the gains simply put the market back on track to match last year's overall pace, rather than signaled a significant momentum gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders, economists and analysts described the May increase as a delayed rebound to normal sales levels after a weak start to the spring selling season, which was hampered by harsh weather and the fitful economic recovery. Many cautioned that one or two more months of strong gains are needed to prove that the housing recovery indeed has gained steam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Commerce Department reported Tuesday that contracts to sell newly built homes in May amounted to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 504,000, up a heady 18.6% from the rate in April, and up 16.9% from the May 2013 pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, sales on a year-to-date basis show that the May gain simply amounted to catch-up for weak sales earlier in 2014. Builders sold roughly 194,000 homes in this year's first five months, nearly matching the 193,000 from the same period of 2013, Commerce data shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists noted that the monthly Commerce figures can be volatile and prone to later revisions. The April-to-May increase of 18.6% was the steepest one-month jump since January 1992, but it came with a margin of error of plus or minus 17.3 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists said the May increase indicates a general rebound in consumer confidence. U.S. job growth has returned to healthy levels, with more than 200,000 jobs added in each of the past four months. Interest rates on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages remain historically low at roughly 4.17%. And home builders generally are more confident now than earlier in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, entry-level buyers remain largely sidelined by stringent mortgage-qualification standards and tepid wage growth, economists said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're going to want to see the June and July numbers to make sure that the [upward] trend is real, that we've exited a soft patch," said Robert Dietz, an economist with the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jon Durden, 36 years old, has a contract to buy a new home in Brentwood, Calif., in September for roughly $503,000. Mr. Durden, who went under contract for the home in May, said that he and his family first looked at existing homes but didn't find anything that fit their needs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Durden said that sellers of previously owned homes in his area favor buyers who can pay all cash or can make a large down payment, something that his family couldn't afford to do. "Cash is king out there right now," he said. "It's tough."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, the preferred lender of <span class="companylink">TRI Pointe Homes Inc</span>., the new-home builder he is buying from, offered to cover $5,000 in closing costs if he chose it. TRI threw in free upgrades, including a solar electricity system, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His real-estate agent, Jodi Marfia of Sharp Realty, said new construction has been especially popular among first-time home buyers, who can't compete with all-cash offers made on many low-price homes in her area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They don't have to fight with 26 other offers" when buying a new home, Ms. Marfia said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doug Duncan, chief economist at mortgage-finance giant <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, is among those who say the May increase might have partly been a bounce from a poor spring. "The first quarter was a disaster," he said, noting that a recent pickup in employment might also be leading to increased sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Duncan said the May rebound might improve confidence among lenders to extend credit to home builders to buy land and build new homes. That could help "rebuild the whole food chain" that leads to more new homes being built, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-building consultant John Burns is among those who consider the May rise an aberration. A survey of 230 home-builder executives by John Burns Real Estate Consulting Inc. found a 3% rise in new-home sales contracts in May from April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One factor seen as limiting home sales -- rising prices -- wasn't a deterrent in May. The median price of new homes put under contract in May was $282,000, up 4.6% from April and up 6.9% from May 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was a 4.5-month supply of new homes on the market at the end of May, down from a 5.3-month inventory in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">May's rise was led by the Northeast, where sales surged 54.5% from April, and the West, where sales were up 34%. They rose 14.2% in the South and ticked up 1.4% in the Midwest.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors in the past week have closed on two separate purchases of apartment complexes in the Denver region and Washington -- for a total of $324 million -- in the latest sign of the surprising endurance of the multifamily sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A venture including the <span class="companylink">Guardian Life Insurance Company of America</span> and <span class="companylink">Allstate Life Insurance Co</span>. bought a $229 million portfolio of 1,514 units in Denver, Aurora, Colo., and Renton, Wash. Radco Cos., an Atlanta-based real-estate investment firm, acquired a $95 million apartment complex with 512 units in the Lakewood suburb of Denver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyers said projected yields were 6% and 5.9%, respectively. That is a decline from average yields in the Denver area of 6.3% in the 12 months ending on March 30. Falling yields typically represent rising prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The continued strength of the multifamily sales market has been a relief to many landlords who were worried the market would weaken. Rental apartment buildings were among the first types of commercial properties to rebound after the recession. But as early as 2011, some analysts were predicting the sector would cool off, fearing competition from improving home prices and the fledgling single-family rental market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those thunderclouds passed without a storm. The competition from the sales market has been weaker than expected largely because mortgage lending has continued to be restrictive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rental apartment values nationally are up 14% from the peak 2007 levels hit before the downturn, according to a Green Street Advisors index that tracks the performance of listed rental-apartment landlords. Sales volume in Denver increased 15% in the first quarter compared with a year ago, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics Inc</span>., a research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rents and occupancy rates also are up nationwide. In the first quarter of this year, rents rose another 0.6% -- up 13% since the upswing began in 2009 -- and vacancies fell to 4%, according to real-estate data firm <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Denver has been one of the strongest housing markets in the country, fueled by a high-tech and startup scene that has launched companies including <span class="companylink">Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Rally Software Development</span>. Denver has seen 2.8% job growth in the year ending in April, compared with 1.7% nationally, according to Green Street Advisors analyst Dave Bragg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property prices in Denver are up 23% since 2007, the biggest rise of any U.S. city outside of San Francisco, according to Green Street. Denver's growing job market "bodes very, very well for" its rental market, Mr. Bragg said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Moran, who leads <span class="companylink">Allstate</span>'s real-estate investment group, says the Denver portfolio is appealing because it consists of "workforce housing" with monthly rents ranging from $1.20 to $1.35 a square foot. Few developers are building such housing right now, he said, leaving the market wide open for high returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dan Fasulo, managing director of Real Capital, also said workforce housing has less risk than upscale apartments because there is less new supply in the pipeline. "If the overall economy does improve, you'll basically reap the benefits," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TruAmerica Multifamily, an investment firm founded last year by industry veteran Bob Hart and Guardian Life Insurance, was part of the buying group and will manage the portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TruAmerica and its partners will spend between $25 million and $30 million renovating the apartment buildings, which were built in the 1970s and '80s. Mr. Hart said he hopes to see a 20% to 25% rise in rents over the next five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Radco plans to spend about $1.2 million on renovations including updating the clubhouse, swimming pool and dog spa. "Denver is a dog town," said Radco founder Norman Radow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some question whether Denver's housing market can maintain this trajectory. Denver's rents have been on the rise for the past five years, up 20% since peak '07 levels. "You can't do 10% rent increases every year," Mr. Fasulo said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others worry that an oversupply of upscale housing will flood the market. The supply of multifamily housing in Denver is expected to rise 8.1% in the next four years, according to Green Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Radow thinks his firm is getting in on the front end of the trend. "We think the rent curve is continuing to go up," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prospects for housing have improved, but it is hardly the time for hosannas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> on Monday reported that sales of existing (or previously owned) homes in May rose 4.9% from April, seasonally adjusted. Better still, on Tuesday the Commerce Department reported that new-home sales gained 18.6% in May, reaching a six-year high. Even after allowing for the large error bars around the new home-sales figures, in particular, it seems like housing is escaping its recent funk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To some extent, the improvement in sales is probably a payback for a tough winter. But slowing home-price appreciation may have had something to do with it as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, the latest reading of the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller 20-City Composite Home Price Index, for April, was up 10.8% from a year before. The March reading had shown a 12.4% annual gain. The <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span>'s less-closely watched house-price index -- a more timely measure because, unlike the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller, it isn't based on a three-month average -- showed monthly price gains halted in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may be that the supply problems that have pushed prices higher are finally alleviating. That matters because with home prices outpacing incomes, the possibility of owning has been getting further out of reach for many would-be first-time buyers. Meanwhile, owners hoping to move into something bigger or nicer have seen the price difference between their current homes and their dream homes expand to the point that many are opting to just stay put.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Absent more first-time buyers, and more trading activity, home sales will be stuck at levels that are far below where history says they should be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But price hasn't been the only thing holding back the housing market. The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s senior loan officer survey shows that as the economy has recovered, banks have been far slower to relax lending standards for mortgages than for other types of loans. In recent quarters they have actually tightened a bit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Applying hard lessons from the bust, households also may be doing some self regulation, demanding higher down payments of themselves and more comfort that they will have the means to make payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meeting both of those criteria depends on a better job market. Although the <span class="companylink">Labor Department</span> reported that U.S. payrolls finally rose past their January 2008 peak last month, the population rose by about 15 million people during that period. Moreover, adjusted for inflation, average hourly earnings have made no progress since the recession ended five years ago this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is cheering that the price and supply problems that have held back housing are showing some improvement. True recovery, though, rests on employment improving to the point that banks are more willing to extend mortgages and households are more willing to take them. There is hope that with the recent pickup in payrolls, that time is no longer over the horizon. But it hasn't come yet.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales soared in May to their highest level in six years, the latest evidence that the U.S. housing recovery is regaining traction after an extended slowdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new single-family homes rose nearly 19% from April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 504,000, a new postrecession high, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. May sales were up 16.9% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">May's big increase represents just a month of data and may reflect, at least in part, the report's small sample size. The 18.6% rise -- the biggest one-month jump in new-home sales since 1992 -- came with a margin of error of plus or minus 17.3 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The new-home sales numbers are very volatile month-to-month. When we look at the year-to-date change, it's up only 1% year-over-year," said Jed Kolko, chief economist at real-estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>. "Future months will tell us whether new-home sales really are closer to flat, or on a big upward climb."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of newly built homes account for only about 10% of U.S. home-buying activity. But the rise in new-home sales the past two months reinforces other signs of strength in the housing market this spring. Existing-home sales were up a seasonally adjusted 4.9% in May after rising 1.5% in April, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market is shaking off the slump from earlier this year," Mr. Kolko said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was a 4.5-month supply of new homes on the market at the end of May, down from a 5.3-month inventory at the end of April. There was a 5.6-month supply of previously owned homes on the market at the end of last month, down from a 5.7-month supply in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Accelerating sales could encourage builders to step up construction. Housing starts fell 6.5% in May but jumped 12.7% the prior month, according to Commerce data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market began to heal in the years following the 2007-2009 recession, with both new- and existing-home sales rising strongly from late 2011 through mid-2013. But the recovery hit a rough patch last summer as mortgage rates jumped and prices rose, then slowed further with the arrival of harsh winter weather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales bottomed out in March, rose in April and jumped last month to a pace last seen in May 2008. May's rise was led by the Northeast, where sales surged 54.5% from April, and the West, where sales were up 34%. New-home sales rose 14.2% in the South and ticked up 1.4% in the Midwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowing costs have come down a bit in recent months. The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage last week was 4.17%, compared with an average of 4.43% in January, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price gains have slowed, too. The S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index for 20 major U.S. cities, also released Tuesday, rose 10.8% in April from a year earlier, down from a 12.4% yearly pace in March.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Denver has been one of the strongest housing markets in the country, fueled by a high-tech and startup scene that has launched companies including <span class="companylink">Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Rally Software Development</span>. Denver has seen 2.8% job growth in the year ending in April, compared with 1.7% nationally, according to Green Street Advisors analyst Dave Bragg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property prices in Denver are up 23% since 2007, the biggest rise of any U.S. city outside of San Francisco, according to Green Street. Denver's growing job market "bodes very, very well for" its rental market, Mr. Bragg said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Moran, who leads <span class="companylink">Allstate</span>'s real-estate investment group, says the Denver portfolio is appealing because it consists of "workforce housing" with monthly rents ranging from $1.20 to $1.35 a square foot. Few developers are building such housing right now, he said, leaving the market wide open for high returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dan Fasulo, managing director of Real Capital, also said workforce housing has less risk than upscale apartments because there is less new supply in the pipeline. "If the overall economy does improve, you'll basically reap the benefits," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TruAmerica Multifamily, an investment firm founded last year by industry veteran Bob Hart and Guardian Life Insurance, was part of the buying group and will manage the portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TruAmerica and its partners will spend between $25 million and $30 million renovating the apartment buildings, which were built in the 1970s and '80s. Mr. Hart said he hopes to see a 20% to 25% rise in rents over the next five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Radco plans to spend about $1.2 million on renovations including updating the clubhouse, swimming pool and dog spa. "Denver is a dog town," said Radco founder Norman Radow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some question whether Denver's housing market can maintain this trajectory. Denver's rents have been on the rise for the past five years, up 20% since peak '07 levels. "You can't do 10% rent increases every year," Mr. Fasulo said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others worry that an oversupply of upscale housing will flood the market. The supply of multifamily housing in Denver is expected to rise 8.1% in the next four years, according to Green Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Radow thinks his firm is getting in on the front end of the trend. "We think the rent curve is continuing to go up," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. stocks edged down Monday, as investors paused to assess the market's string of recent gains and a batch of corporate deal news.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 30 points, or 0.2%, to 16917 in midday trading. The S&amp;P 500 index was off two points, or 0.1%, at 1961. The Nasdaq Composite Index declined a point to 4367.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The modest moves come after a recent steady grind higher in stocks. The S&amp;P 500 posted its third straight all-time high and its 22nd record of the year on Friday, and the index is up about 6% on the year. The <span class="companylink">Dow</span> is up about 2% this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slow climb comes as trading volumes have tumbled and stocks have failed to make big moves. Monday was on track to be the 46th straight session in which the S&amp;P 500 closed with a move of less than 1% -- the longest such stretch since 1995.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">News of a handful of corporate tie-ups was driving buying and selling in select stocks, but overall trading activity was quiet, said Keith Bliss, senior vice president at brokerage <span class="companylink">Cuttone &amp; Co</span>. "I think people are trying to keep their powder dry," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data calendar was light, except for a report showing that existing home sales increased 4.9% in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.89 million, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had forecast a rate of 4.75 million for the month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sean McCarthy, regional chief investment officer at <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo Private Bank</span>, said he has been encouraged by the recent string of upbeat economic data following a slowdown earlier in the year. He said he expects stocks broadly to post modest single-digit gains this year as long as the economy continues to improve and corporate earnings grow as expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What the market has wanted to see is good economic data, and overall we're getting that in the second quarter," said Mr. McCarthy, whose firm manages $170 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Micros Systems rose 3.4% after The Wall Street Journal reported <span class="companylink">Oracle</span> is close to sealing a deal to buy the software company for about $5 billion. <span class="companylink">Oracle</span> edged up 0.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Integrys Energy Group</span> surged 13% after the company agreed to be acquired by <span class="companylink">Wisconsin Energy</span> for $5.71 billion in cash and stock. <span class="companylink">Wisconsin Energy</span> shares fell 2.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lululemon Athletica</span> rallied 3.7% after The Wall Street Journal reported the yoga gear maker's founder is working with bankers at <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> to find a way to gain more influence over the company's operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Central Garden &amp; Pet</span> climbed 9.1% after <span class="companylink">Harbinger Group</span> said it has offered to buy the company for about $505 million, or $1.1 billion including debt. Harbinger rose 1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European stocks slid after a report that euro-zone business activity slowed this month and as U.K. housing shares fell on the prospect of changes to mortgage rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Stoxx Europe 600 index lost 0.5% to 346.31.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markit's preliminary June purchasing managers index for the euro zone, which measures activity across both the manufacturing and services sectors, fell to 52.8 from 53.5 in May, missing expectations of 53.3. Readings above 50 signal expansion. The main weak spot was France, where activity contracted for a second straight month, and at a quickening pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.K. real-estate shares dropped following reports that the <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span> this week will propose measures aimed at paring the pace of growth in the country's booming housing market. Britain's finance minister, George Osborne, this month gave the central bank new powers to cap mortgage-lending limits, and the bank's Financial Policy Committee is expected to unveil recommendations Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">British home builders <span class="companylink">Barratt Developments</span> and Persimmon lost 2.7% and 1.1%, respectively, and <span class="companylink">Taylor Wimpey</span> gave up 1.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Alstom</span> reversed course and fell 4.1%. France on Sunday won an option to buy a 20% stake in the company from France's <span class="companylink">Bouygues</span>. The move was part of an agreement to support <span class="companylink">General Electric</span>'s bid to purchase <span class="companylink">Alstom</span>'s energy business.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kathleen Madigan </div><div>329 words</div><div>24 June 2014</div><div>05:00</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The yearly growth in home prices across the U.S. slowed more than expected in April, according to a home price report released Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home price index covering 10 major U.S. cities increased 10.8% in the year ended in April, said the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index report. The 20-city price index also advanced 10.8%. That is down from a 12.4% yearly pace in March and less than the 11.4% expected by economists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November, the year-over-year growth for home prices in 20 major cities hit a cyclical peak of 13.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Overall, prices are rising month-to-month but at a slower rate," said David M. Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at <span class="companylink">S&amp;P</span><span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> Indices. "Last year some Sunbelt cities were seeing year-over-year numbers close to 30%, now all are below 20%."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On an unadjusted basis, the 10-city index increased 1.0% and the 20-city composite rose 1.1%. Seasonally adjusted, the 10-city gauge was unchanged, while the 20-city index rose 0.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although housing affordability remains attractive when compared historically, the rise in home prices and a 2013 spike in mortgage rates mean home buying this year is more expensive compared with last spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, home demand may be picking up after a weak winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Near-term economic factors favor further gains in housing: mortgage rates are lower than a year ago, the <span class="companylink">Fed</span> is expected to keep interest rates steady until mid-2015 and the labor market is improving," Mr. Blitzer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> reported Monday that sales of existing homes increased a better-than-expected 4.9% to an annual rate of 4.89 million in May, the highest sales rate since October.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Eric Morath   </div><div>545 words</div><div>24 June 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes rose strongly in May but remain shy of last year's pace, a sign the housing market has tentatively regained its footing this spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Monday that sales of existing homes increased 4.9% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.89 million homes. That was the highest pace since October, the last month annualized sales topped the five-million mark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coupled with an improvement in April, the May figure suggests the housing market has bounced back from a dismal winter and buyers are adjusting to modestly higher interest rates compared with the spring of 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, May sales were down 5% from a year earlier and the recent rebound could be slowed if interest rates on mortgages begin to rise, as many economists project. Because of the sluggish start to 2014, the Realtor group expects a 3% decline in sales this year from 2013's 5.09 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It would be risky to assume this gain marks the start of a sustainable rebound," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. The recent sales gains are largely "a reversal of the winter hit," and other reports do "not support the idea that demand is recovering," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a strong start last year, home sales began to ease in August before perking up this spring. The roller coaster coincides with interest rates that jumped a percentage point in the spring of 2013 but have moderated recently, touching a six-month low in May. The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage stood at 4.17% last week, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower mortgage rates make home purchases more affordable for borrowers. But NAR economist Lawrence Yun said he expects rates to start moving back up soon, reaching 5% by the first quarter of 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates have edged lower this year even as the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> scaled back its bond-buying program designed to push down long-term interest rates. That program is expected to end later this year, and then the <span class="companylink">Fed</span> will contemplate increasing short-term rates from near zero.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday's report showed the median sale price of a home in May was up 5.1% from a year earlier to $213,400 -- the slowest annual gain since March 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of homes available for sale rose 6% from a year earlier. At the current pace, it would take 5.6 months to exhaust the supply -- just below a typical level. The increased inventory drove May's strong sales pace, said <span class="companylink">IHS</span> Global Insight U.S. economist Stephanie Karol.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A larger inventory of homes could set up a virtuous cycle where the better selection draws buyers to the market, which in turn sustains price gains. That then entices additional sellers to list. One weak link in that chain, however, could be first-time buyers. The share of first-time buyers fell in May even as sales rose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market can only retain its strength for so long if move-up buyers cannot find a first-time buyer to purchase their starter homes," Ms. Karol said.</p>
