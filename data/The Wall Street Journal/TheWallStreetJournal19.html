<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign buyers are willing to pay top dollar for second homes abroad, but the location needs to be a safe bet, according to a coming report on foreign ownership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 47% of prime home buyers are drawn to locations they view as solid investments, according to a report by Knight Frank, a global property consultancy based in London. To buyers, locations such as London and New York are protected from economic and political risk, plus offer potential for property appreciation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High-end buyers seek out tried-and-true places because they are still reeling from the economic downturn five years ago, says James Price, head of international residential development at Knight Frank who worked on the report. "They want liquidity. They want the best places to invest and be secure," he says. "The reasons London and New York are very popular is they are two genuine safe havens."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers looking for trophy assets may be willing to try a more offbeat locale for lifestyle features, but that isn't a typical motivation, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Knight Frank's Global Development Insight report, set to be released Friday, looks at buyer requirements for prime, newly built residential properties. The report -- based on Knight Frank search data, sales data and survey responses from 54 individuals world-wide -- ranked the leading countries from which buyers originate, and the most common sales locations and prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Latin American buyers are big players in Miami, but they aren't ranked in Knight Frank's list, says Mr. Price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside of the safe havens, buyers tend to buy in their own regions, the report shows. Buyers in China are the most significant purchasers of prime new-build properties internationally, spurred by a strong yuan and slowing domestic economy, the report says. Although their interest extends to properties in New York and London, their primary interest remains regional, the report shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Russia, which ranked third on Knight Frank's list, buyers look abroad after exhausting local options. "They already have property portfolios in Russia -- a city home, a country home -- and then they're looking for another property abroad," says Elena Yurgeneva, director of residential at Knight Frank in Russia and the <span class="companylink">Commonwealth of Independent States</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese investors have been snapping up real estate in the world's most important cities this year. While it's easy to dismiss rich foreign buyers as the dumb money in any market, these investors are taking a sensible approach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After earning big profits at home, Chinese investors are looking abroad for safer assets that offer steady returns. They are shifting their increasingly valuable currency out of China's expensive property market and into the likes of Manhattan and San Francisco—bargains by comparison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"China is not growing at the same velocity, so companies are looking at other markets to supplement that growth," said Marc Giuffrida, an executive director at real-estate services firm CBRE, who was involved in many of the China outbound property deals this year. "Investors and developers are prepared to take lower investment returns in global gateway markets compared to China, because they are trading off to get greater stability, transparency and liquidity."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese companies poured $7.7 billion into commercial and residential buildings abroad in the first three quarters of 2013, 46% more than in all of 2012 and more than three times as much as in 2011, according to CBRE.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, Shanghai conglomerate <span class="companylink">Fosun International Ltd</span>. said it is buying One Chase Manhattan Plaza, a landmark office tower in the Wall Street area, for $725 million. That's $330 a square foot, a third less than last year's average price for Shanghai office buildings, according to China Office Research Center, a think tank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese individuals looking for bargains and safe places for their savings are likewise finding them abroad. Shanghai entrepreneur David Li, who owns more than a dozen apartments in China, bought three in San Francisco in 2011 for a total of $1 million. They have since appreciated 30%, while delivering a 6% yield, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now he is looking to invest more, this time for his own use. Mr. Li is seeking financing to buy a $1.5 million retirement home near San Francisco's Chinatown, though he speaks little English and hasn't lived abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't really want to leave China, but I need an exit strategy in case things go wrong in China," said Mr. Li, whose businesses range from education centers to retirement homes. "I make my money in China and invest it in the U.S.—it is a once-in-a-century opportunity."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flurry of deals, concentrated in top global cities, may remind people of the disastrous U.S. real-estate deals by Japanese investors in the 1980s, such as the ill-timed purchases of Rockefeller Center and Pebble Beach Golf Links.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But better-timed foreign investments can do well. For example, Hong Kong's richest man, Li Ka-shing, profited handsomely from developing the former site of Vancouver's Expo 86 world's fair, as did Hong Kong jewelry tycoon Cheng Yu-tung from an investment in a large 1990s development in Manhattan, known as Riverside South or Trump Place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Developed markets look very attractive," said Michael Klibaner, head of research of Greater China for real-estate-services firm <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>. "It looks like these are sensible purchases."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ambitious Chinese companies are making the London and New York markets look more like that of China—literally. Chinese-style skyscrapers are popping up in formerly low-density areas in the U.K. and Australia. Commercial-property developer <span class="companylink">Dalian Wanda Group</span> is investing $1 billion to launch a luxury hotel in London, which will be the tallest in Western Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">State-owned Greenland Group from Shanghai is pouring $5 billion into a commercial and residential project in Brooklyn called Atlantic Yards. The massive urban-redevelopment effort may look daunting to Americans but less so to Chinese, given how so many of their cities have essentially been rebuilt in the past decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chinese money is flowing to areas with high concentrations of Chinese immigrants—cities such as Sydney, Melbourne, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York and London. For clues on where elite Chinese are headed next, just look at where they are going to school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We see a strong connection between where the leadership of the companies was educated and where they are buying," Mr. Giuffrida said. "They feel they understand the market and are comfortable to take on the risk."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2012, according to a survey by China's largest education portal, EOL, the leading destination for Chinese outbound students was the U.S., which drew 30% of them, followed by the U.K. (21%) and Australia (13%).</p>

</div><div class="author">Esther Fung   </div><div>738 words</div><div>24 October 2013</div><div>18:20</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHANGHAI—Beijing will boost its housing supply by introducing a new type of affordable homes, as property prices in China's capital continue to rise at alarming rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the end of the year authorities will supply 20,000 "self-use" homes—that is, meant for the owner to live in, rather than to hold as an investment—the Beijing Municipal Commission of Housing and Urban-Rural Development said on its website on Wednesday. The homes, to be available to buyers who meet certain government criteria, will be priced about 30% cheaper than comparable housing nearby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another 50,000 self-use units will become available next year, it said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in Beijing have been on a tear in recent months, triggering concerns about a property bubble and rising resentment over unaffordable homes. Prices in September were up 16% from a year earlier, according to a government survey released earlier this week, after a rise of 14.9% in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beijing's plan is also trying to cater to migrant workers, who haven't been able to buy low-income homes under China's restrictive housing-registration, or hukou, system, and have also been priced out of the existing private-housing market. China's leaders have recently tried to remove some of the obstacles for workers from rural areas in the cities where they live and work, part of broader economic goals to raise incomes and drive consumption.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new self-use homes will be available to migrant families that have lived in the capital for at least five years, and have paid social-security taxes during this time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Singles aged 25 and older who fit other government criteria will also be allowed to buy one of these homes, which will mostly be 90 square meters (around 1,000 square feet), with the maximum size capped at 140 square meters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers will be prohibited from selling the home for five years. If they sell after five years, they will owe a 30% capital-gains tax and be barred from buying such homes in future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commission also pledged to punish speculators who dodge restrictions on multiple home purchases—a cornerstone of the nearly four-year campaign to keep prices from overheating—and to intensify scrutiny of developers and their credit conditions, focusing on high-price projects and those providing "excessive" profit margins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Nationwide</span>, prices in 69 of the 70 cities included in the survey were up in September from a year earlier. The average increase for the 70 cities was 8.2%, picking up from August's 7.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn't clear whether the 70,000 self-use homes promised by the end of next year would be ready for occupancy in that period, or still be under construction but available for sale. When completed, though, the 70,000 will "ease the imbalance between demand and supply, adjust people's expectations and stabilize home prices," the Beijing commission's statement said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jinsong Du, a <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> analyst, said new homes would probably require about two years for construction. But he added that the impact of 70,000 homes would be significant, given that the number of new private housing units sold in Beijing last year was 122,646.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The key question is whether the Beijing government will execute this policy exactly by the book, and allocate the new supply to qualified people fairly, or forget or change it in the future—like many previous housing policies," said Mr. Du in a note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past, fraud has been a major problem in low-cost government housing projects. Many people with incomes too high to be eligible have managed to buy by falsely claiming lower income, China's state auditor said in a report in August. Shoddy construction has been another problem, leading to widespread complaints from occupants, state media have reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the maximum size of the homes that singles aged 25 and older who fit other government criteria will also be allowed to buy is capped at 90 square meters. These homes will mostly be 90 square meters, with the maximum size capped at 140 square meters.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long Island home sales, which slumbered when the market perked up across the U.S., jumped in the third quarter to their highest level since 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales also were up elsewhere across the region—New Jersey, Westchester County and New York City—at a time when home sales appeared to be cooling off nationwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median prices also rose across most of the region, and the inventory of homes on the market shrank, suggesting prices may continue to increase at least in the near term, analysts said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one sought-after New Jersey suburb, Glen Ridge, a less than seven-week supply of homes remained on the market at the current sales pace, according to Jeffrey G. Otteau, a New Jersey appraiser and analyst and president of the Otteau Valuation Group. Nearby Montclair had a 21/2 -month supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Otteau said the region was just catching up to the housing recovery that had long bypassed the suburbs. He said the comeback showed the first signs of life in 2009 in Manhattan, where federal bailouts for banks "created a soft landing" for real-estate buyers. It then spread in 2010 to the Midwest and Northwest where manufacturing had surged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing rebound started later than the rest of the country and therefore it has longer to run," he said. "The housing market is still strengthening."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales on Long Island now are leading the region, with sales up 32% compared with the third quarter of 2012, according to a market report released Thursday by Miller Samuel Inc. and <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>. The 2012 period came just before superstorm Sandy damaged thousands of area homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Long Island, it was the fifth-best sales quarter on record since 2003, when Miller Samuel began tracking sales there. Sales were up 23.7% compared with the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price on Long Island rose 4% to $380,000, the highest mark since the third quarter of 2008, when the market was paralyzed by the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan Miller, an appraiser who prepared the Elliman report, said prices on Long Island peaked two years before they did in Manhattan, then drifted lower during the recession before stagnating until 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But in the last several quarters we have seen it start to catch up and be more on par with the region," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Maria Babaev, a broker at the Roslyn, N.Y., office of <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>, this has translated into a burst of activity by would-be buyers who nevertheless remained sensitive to price. "We are seeing multiple bids only if we price right," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the asking price on a new, five-bedroom colonial in the country-club section of Roslyn was cut over the summer by about 10%, the home quickly attracted two prospective buyers, she said. It sold for close to the $1.9 million asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gregory J. Heym, an economist at Halstead Property, said as in other parts of the U.S., buyers in the region who had been "sitting on the fence," worried about rising interest rates, seemed to dismount and buy houses at about the same time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Heym said Long Island sales growth also was being driven by a strengthening job growth. The island's unemployment rate dipped from 7.6% in February to a low of 6% in April—below national and New York City rates—though it since has risen slightly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New Jersey, Mr. Otteau said sales in September were up 9% over the previous September. Preliminary figures showed median prices were up 5.5% in the third quarter from the same period in 2012, the fourth consecutive quarter of price improvement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Westchester, Chris Meyers, the managing principal of Houlihan Lawrence reported that family home sales were up 29% in the third quarter compared with the year-earlier quarter with prices up 4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he said sales, after surging throughout the year, appeared to be leveling off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Connecticut, Halstead Property reported earlier that sales were up in all eight towns the firm tracks in Fairfield County. Prices were up in most towns, but off in Greenwich, the most expensive town tracked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this week, September sales of existing homes nationwide were reported down 1.9% compared with August, with the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> forecasting that sales will hold flat in 2014. In the New York area, analysts said there was more room for growth before sales flatten out as well.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wendell Cox ("Florida Sheds Its 'Smart Growth' Dunce Hat," Cross Country, Oct. 19) is mistaken on many levels. He is right on one: Texas largely avoided the housing price meltdown experienced in Florida, Georgia, Nevada and California. But so did Boston, Seattle, San Francisco and other bastions of "smart growth."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cause of the housing meltdown was not limited supply. The opposite was generally true—supply far exceeded real demand from buyers able to afford their homes. This was especially true in new housing developments—be they Miami condos or California tract homes. What appeared to be very high demand for housing was largely caused by lending policies that permitted loans of 100% of the purchase price, or more. Many buyers were speculators with no intention of ever occupying the home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Texas exception is worth studying in more depth. Texas had the best record of job growth in the nation during the Great Recession and had strong job growth before and after. As a result of good incomes, steady jobs and reasonable prices resulting from supply adequate to meet demand, this state escaped the fate of others. But please note, Texans love smart growth. Their new suburbs are well planned with access to jobs, shopping, schools, recreation and good transportation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cox is wrong to blame smart growth for the housing fiasco. In fact, communities with limited supply and those following smart-growth concepts suffered far, far fewer foreclosures and experienced far, far less decline in prices and loss of equity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter H. St. Clair</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Diego</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state of Florida may have repealed its smart-growth law, but HUD, the DOT and the EPA have jointly funded regional planning in 45 regions throughout the country through their Sustainable Communities Initiative, bypassing state legislatures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the sake of reducing climate change and increasing prosperity, unelected regional planning consultants are recommending zoning and land-use restrictions, mass-transit buildup, increased subsidized housing (see Westchester County, N.Y.) and expanded bike and walking paths. What's really at play here is the planning concept of New Urbanism and Regionalism—restrict housing to urban centers, but if people still leave, tax them in the outlying counties to pay for your green, urban lifestyle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cox should review the Seven50 Plan for a "ladder of transit villages" running up the coast of southeast Florida from Miami to Vero Beach, following a commuter train and feeder bus lines. Urban Transit Boundaries (every U.S. county must have them) stop land development, while the less congested counties are targeted for more HUD housing, train stops and tax revenues. In the name of stopping the rising tides and job creation, the citizens of Indian River, St. Lucie and Martin counties must reduce their lifestyle expectations, start riding bikes and pay more taxes to support the region. Tallahassee isn't wearing the dunce hat. Washington, D.C., is.</p>

</div><div class="author">Austin Kilham </div><div>598 words</div><div>23 October 2013</div><div>05:39</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The client was in her late 60s when her husband passed away three years ago. He left his primary residence and second home to his wife and the rest of his assets to his children from a previous marriage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While writing the man's will, the couple had agreed that after his death the wife would move into their second home and sell their primary residence to fund her retirement. But they hadn't anticipated that the housing market would be in a slump when he died.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The woman feared that poor market conditions would affect her ability to retire. She brought that concern to her advisers John DiCiaccio and Leah Thomson Snell, partners at Pasadena, Calif.-based DiCiaccio Group at Snowden Capital Advisors, which manages $1 billion for 2,000 clients. Both advisers share clients and work together with them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"She had to sell during the housing market collapse and was worried because she was getting low offers," says Mr. DiCiaccio. "She needed to know the lowest offer she could accept and still live comfortably."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house was valued at $2.5 million, and the highest offer the woman had received was $2.35 million. It wasn't a big difference, and the advisers quickly realized that accepting the lower bid would not have a large impact on the woman's retirement. In fact, holding on to the house had the potential to derail her financial plans more than selling at a lower price, Mr. DiCiaccio says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the woman's emotional attachment to the home and her fears about her long-term financial stability made her reluctant to drop her price. The advisers realized they needed to convince her that it was safe to sell the home. "The client fit the profile of women of her generation who often feel they aren't able to take over the family finances," says Ms. Snell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pair started with a budget analysis to determine how much income the woman would need to maintain her standard of living. The advisers' previous retirement plan for the widow called for investing the $2.5 million generated from the sale of the house in a portfolio that could generate monthly income of $10,000. They showed her that accepting the $2.35 million offer would only reduce her monthly income by $300--an amount she could make up by cutting nonessential expenses like dining out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next, they pointed out that holding on to the house was costing her money in taxes and upkeep. They reminded her that each day she kept the house she also risked the need for a major repair and even greater downturn in the market. Finally, they noted that accepting a lower price would result in a lower commission paid to her broker and less state and federal capital-gains taxes, which would end up saving her close to $45,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seeing that she had overestimated the risk of selling her home at a lower price, the woman agreed to accept the buyer's offer. She invested the proceeds from sale, moved to her second home and is happy with her new lifestyle. She was even able to go back to school to finish a Ph.D.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When people get in the position where they have to consider offers, they can feel insulted and it becomes an ego thing," says Mr. DiCiaccio. "But if you can unplug the emotion, take the ego out, you can show them they're winning by accomplishing a bigger goal." </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. stocks pared gains Tuesday as losses in technology shares offset renewed expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue its easy-money policies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 64 points, or 0.4%, to 15457 in midday trading, after earlier gaining as much as 126 points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P 500 gained eight points, or 0.5%, to 1753. The Nasdaq Composite Index added six points, or 0.2%, to 3926. The <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> was up as many as 28 points earlier in the day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, the S&amp;P 500 rose fractionally to post a fourth-straight gain and close at a record high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">U.S. government</span>'s September nonfarm payroll report showed 148,000 jobs were added last month, less than expectations for a gain of 180,000. The unemployment rate ticked lower to 7.2%; economists had expected it to remain flat at 7.3%. The jobs report was delayed by more than two weeks because of the government shutdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the wake of the jobs report, traders say the debate on Fed policy is shifting from whether the Fed would start to pull back on its easing efforts, to how long into 2014 the Fed will wait.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It doesn't really change the current narrative," said R.J. Grant, associate director of equity trading at <span class="companylink">KBW Inc</span>. "It's not strong enough that the Fed is going to think about pulling back, it's not weak enough that it looks like total gloom and doom."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve is expected to maintain its stimulus measures until it can assess the impact of the 16-day government shutdown that ended last week. Fed stimulus has helped the market rally this year because low interest rates hold down corporate costs, and the stimulus money itself leaks into the stock market, fueling investment there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data on August construction spending, which was also delayed because of the government shutdown, showed a rise of 0.6% on the month, slightly above expectations. Spending in July was revised sharply higher to 1.4% from the initial estimate of a 0.6% rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cautionary comments from Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings weighed on the tech-focused <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> Composite Index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Netflix reported third-quarter earnings and revenue late Monday that exceeded analyst estimates and provided a fourth-quarter earnings outlook that was above forecasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Netflix shares slid 4.9% after Mr. Hastings wrote in an investor letter: "We had solid results compounded by momentum-investor-fueled euphoria."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His comments hit other momentum stocks. <span class="companylink">Priceline.com</span>, Yelp, <span class="companylink">Tesla Motors</span> and <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> -- all up significantly this year -- fell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">United Technologies</span> shed 2.1% after the maker of Otis elevators and <span class="companylink">Pratt &amp; Whitney</span> aircraft engines reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings and raised its full-year outlook. But the company said it plans to spend $500 million restructuring for 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Asia, stock markets were mixed. China's Shanghai Composite lost 0.8% to 2210.65, pulling back from the previous session's sharp rally, as data showing that average home prices rose to another fresh high sparked some fear that the government would step in to cool the property market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hong Kong-listed Chinese developers were weak after the home data. <span class="companylink">China Resources Land</span> fell 1%, and China Overseas Land &amp; Investment dropped 0.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 0.5% to 23315.99, hurt by China Mobile's 3.4% drop after it reported that nine-month net profit fell 1.9%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 advanced 0.4% to 5373.10, helped by <span class="companylink">BHP Billiton</span>. The mining giant climbed 2.4% after it raised its iron-ore production guidance for the 2014 fiscal year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European markets rose for a ninth straight day. The Stoxx Europe 600 index gained 0.5% to 320.97, the highest close since June 2008. Germany's DAX 30 index added 0.9% to 8947.46, a record close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Gjensidige Forsikring</span> jumped 8% in Oslo after the insurance firm posted a 6% rise in third-quarter earnings per share.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.K. House Prices Not a Bubble . . . Yet</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.K. economy has been surprisingly strong this year. The latest data point is positively startling: the average asking price for a London house rose 10.2% on the month in October, to a record GBP 544,432 ($880,183), according to property website Rightmove. The news will fuel the U.K. debate about whether a new housing bubble is getting under way. But most of the data don't support that contention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">True, the monthly data is volatile, and Rightmove itself says the rise is unsustainable. The capital is vastly different from the rest of the country, with particularly strong demand from overseas investors. Asking prices are far less buoyant in other regions; the national monthly rise was 2.8%. And although the rise coincides with the introduction of the government's Help to Buy mortgage subsidies, it is unlikely to reflect a direct effect from that program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other indicators of housing activity are relatively limp. The number of mortgages approved in August rose 31% year on year, Bank of England data show; but at 62,226 they are less than half the precrisis peak. U.K. house prices have fallen 26% from their late-2007 peak in real terms, <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> said in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the U.K.'s love affair with property shouldn't be underestimated. True, households still are heavily indebted, and income growth is poor. But there may be significant pent-up activity to come. The average number of first-home buyers in the past five years is 57% below the average for 1998-2007, according to <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>. And supply is a worry. In 1995-2007, house prices tripled, but new housing starts rose by only 25,000 a year, failing to match demand, <span class="companylink">Berenberg Bank</span> notes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the Bank of England holding interest rates at 0.5%, plus the Help to Buy program, the risk remains that more and more cash ends up being pumped into housing, an unproductive asset. The U.K. has created conditions for its economy to expand; the question remains as to whether it is healthy growth that sees investment and exports rise or unhealthy, debt-driven growth in consumption. The housing market will play a vital role. The signs from London don't inspire confidence.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EDF's Nuclear Fallout Will be Limited</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal to build the U.K.'s first new nuclear reactors in 20 years was always going to prove politically radioactive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics of the government's agreement with <span class="companylink">Electricite de France</span> will squeal that the long-term price guaranteed for the reactors' output, which at GBP 92.50 ($149.53) per megawatt hour is about twice current wholesale prices, will deliver profits to foreign state-owned operators at the expense of consumers. Yet EDF shares barely budged on the news. Investors may have other concerns. EDF is used to political ructions. Almost 80% of the utility's output in France is sold under regulated tariffs or other mechanisms by which prices are effectively set by the authorities, notes <span class="companylink">RBC Capital Markets</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the utility has done well in limiting its exposure to a project still subject to huge uncertainty. True, the deal's price is lower than some expected. But 65% of the GBP 16 billion project cost will be funded through debt guaranteed by the U.K. Treasury. Bringing in France's Areva and two Chinese equity partners means EDF likely won't consolidate the project's debt. Meanwhile, its share of the investment falls to about GBP 3.5 billion, notes <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>, manageable given EDF's market value of nearly GBP 50 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question remains whether EDF can build a new nuclear facility on time and to budget. While the company negotiated various protections for changes in law or rising operating costs, the risk of a rising construction budget is borne squarelyby the operators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EDF argues it has learned from expensive mishaps elsewhere. At about $8,000 a kilowatt, the U.K. project's budget already far exceeds the <span class="companylink">U.S. Energy Information Administration</span>'s estimates for new nuclear capital costs of about $5,500 a kilowatt. That could suggest a healthy buffer. More likely, it reflects the fact that costs of actual projects have spiraled far above estimates of theoretical plants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.K. deal should shore up confidence that EDF's nuclear strategy has a future. Its shares have risen nearly 85% this year, pushing its valuation to a premium to the sector, <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> said. That has been fueled by hopes the French government will extend the life span of its existing French nuclear plants, boosting earnings. But EDF also may need further, unpopular tariff increases in France, given its rising investment. Political hubbub at home may be the bigger risk for EDF from here on.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fracking Leaves Brazil Lacking</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brazil, no stranger to riots this year, saw another one Monday, as protesters tried to block the latest auction of an oil license there. But it isn't the bidders trying to get access to Brazil's energy riches that should worry irate citizens. It is the ones who aren't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Protesters complain that Brasilia is selling the country's birthright to foreigners. The latter figured large in the winning consortium of <span class="companylink">Royal Dutch Shell</span>, Total, <span class="companylink">China National Petroleum</span>, Cnooc and Brazil's own <span class="companylink">Petroleo Brasileiro</span>. But, as repeated cutbacks to oil-output targets have shown, Brazil needs more foreign capital to develop its large but complex offshore fields. Oil left underground for want of a rig won't fund many schools or hospitals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few Western oil firms even took part in this auction. It is telling that the winning bid came from a consortium -- and that it was the only bid. Little wonder its proposed allocation of oil to the government came in at the minimum level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brazil's discoveries should thrill any wildcatter. But the welcome mat for foreign firms has been shrinking. And Brazil isn't the only game in town. Areas like West Africa and Iraq also compete for attention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, another rival has re-emerged to the north. The shale boom has pulled investment dollars from even committed globetrotters like <span class="companylink">Exxon Mobil</span> back to more familiar territory: The U.S. Investment there topped $148 billion last year, up 67% since 2010, according to IHS Herold. That is about double the rate of growth elsewhere. Brazilian politicians wondering where all the bidders went should listen for that giant fracking sound.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking Up After Shutting Down</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all the fears it fanned, the U.S. shutdown didn't seem to dent investors' appetite for risk. Consider how various stock markets did between Oct. 1 and Oct. 16. The S&amp;P 500 returned 2.4%, not bad given how close we came to a debt-ceiling breach. Better yet was the MSCI Emerging Markets index, rising 4.4% in dollar terms in this period. Even more robust were some frontier markets. The MSCI index for Latin America and the Caribbean, for example, returned 10.5%. But the best performer was Greece, which soared 12.8% in dollar terms. The riskier the stocks, the more investors seemed to like them. (Gold, in contrast, fell 4%.) Like so many market peculiarities these days, the driver may have been the Federal Reserve. The shutdown probably just reassured investors that easy money won't be turned off anytime soon.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. stocks were little changed Monday, with the S&amp;P 500 easing from a fresh record high, as investors digested mixed earnings reports and awaited key employment data due out later this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 13 points, or 0.1%, to 15387 in midday trading. The S&amp;P 500 fell one point to 1744. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up eight points, or 0.2%, at 3922.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P 500 was just off an all-time intraday high of 1747.83 hit early in the session, while the technology-oriented Nasdaq eased from an earlier 13-year high of 3931.45. The Dow traded well below its Sept. 18 record closing high of 15676.94.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earnings took center stage after lawmakers reached a deal last week to suspend the debt ceiling and reopen the federal government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With the government shutdown out of the way you'll see much more scrutiny on profit reports," said Dane Leone, head of U.S. market strategy at Macquarie in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> eased 0.9% after the fast-food giant reported third-quarter earnings that rose slightly above analyst estimates, but provided a downbeat outlook for October same-store sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Halliburton declined 2.3% as third-quarter revenue fell shy of forecasts, overshadowing earnings that slightly beat expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies in the S&amp;P 500-stock index are on track for 1% third-quarter earnings growth from last year, according to FactSet, while analysts expected 3% at the beginning of earnings-reporting season. But without a surprise quarterly loss from <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span> earlier this month, companies would be on track for 3.6% growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span> edged 0.1% lower after the bank reached a tentative agreement to pay $13 billion to end a number of civil investigations into its sale of mortgage securities before the 2008 financial crisis, as reported by The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The technology sector got a boost from a 3% gain in Apple, which is expected to unveil a new batch of iPads on Tuesday as it looks to fend off new looks and size and pricing options from rivals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Focus on economic data will increase the rest of the week, as the releases that were postponed during the 16-day government shutdown start trickling in. On Tuesday, the government will release the September employment report, originally scheduled for Oct. 2.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Garry Evans, global head of equity strategy with <span class="companylink">HSBC</span>, said he would still watch the jobs report closely despite the delay. He said a strong or weak report would affect the Federal Reserve's decision about when it will start paring, or "tapering," its stimulus efforts. The report could have extra significance, he said, because it will not include distortions from the <span class="companylink">U.S. government</span> shutdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The timing of tapering is up in the air again," Mr. Evans said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data from the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> showed that existing home sales for September fell to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 5.29 million, just below expectations of 5.3 million.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks rallied Tuesday as a weak jobs report fueled expectations that the Federal Reserve will keep its current easy-money policies in place into next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the employment report for September provided a disappointing picture of the economy at a time when corporate earnings are already sluggish, for many investors, the Fed's unprecedented efforts to pump money into the financial markets have been a key factor behind the stock market's run to new record highs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 75.46 points, or 0.49%, to 15467.66, 1.3% below its record finish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P 500 added 10.01 points, or 0.57%, to a new record close of 1754.67, with materials and consumer staples stocks leading gains in nine of 10 industry sectors. The Nasdaq Composite Index added 9.52 points, or 0.24%, to 3929.57.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government's September nonfarm payroll, which was delayed by more than two weeks because of the government shutdown, showed 148,000 jobs were added last month. That came in below expectations for a gain of 180,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the wake of the jobs data, traders say expectations for when the Fed will begin to pull back on its easing efforts are shifting from this year into 2014. That should allow stocks to continue grinding higher, investors say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data are "not strong enough that the Fed is going to think about pulling back, it's not weak enough that it looks like total gloom and doom," said R.J. Grant, associate director of equity trading at <span class="companylink">KBW Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traders said the rally came amid average volumes and was dominated by trading looking to profit from intraday volatility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Expectations that the Fed will maintain its easing efforts also led to a sharp drop in <span class="companylink">U.S. Treasury</span> yields. The rate on the 10-year Treasury note slipped to 2.512%, the lowest level since July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro traded at $1.3749 just after the data, its strongest level against the dollar level since November 2011. The euro continued to climb, recently trading as high as $1.3792 compared with $1.3681 late Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere in the stock market, cautionary comments from Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings weighed on the technology-heavy Nasdaq.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Netflix late Monday reported third-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded analyst estimates, boosted by healthy subscriber growth, and provided a fourth-quarter earnings outlook above forecasts. But with the stock having nearly quadrupled in value since the start of the year, Mr. Hastings warned investors not to get carried away. The stock was sharply higher in after-hours trading Monday, but tumbled more than 9% Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hastings's comment hit other stocks that have seen large gains this year. <span class="companylink">Priceline.com</span>, Yelp, and <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> —all up significantly this year—traded lower Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With such stocks at the forefront, there is "more volatility than volume," said Matthew Cheslock, a trader with brokerage firm <span class="companylink">Virtu Financial</span>. "We don't see many initiating positions right now," he said. "People might not be selling, but there aren't a lot of new trades."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apple shares slid after the company at an event unveiled a new, lighter iPad, new software to operate its computers and new laptop and desktop computers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">November crude-oil futures fell 1.4% to $97.80 a barrel, the lowest settlement in nearly four months. October gold futures gained 2% to $1,342.50 an ounce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European markets finished higher. The Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.4% to the highest closing value since June 2008. The index notched a ninth gain in a row, which marks the longest winning streak since June 2010. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 index tacked on 0.6%, Germany's DAX 30 index added 0.9% to finish at a new record high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asian markets were mixed.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks in Japan and Australia rose Tuesday, ahead of the U.S. labor report, while Hong Kong was weighed down by China Mobile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 0.5% to 23315.99, weighed down by its second-largest constituent. China Mobile, the world's largest mobile carrier by subscribers dropped 3.4% after reporting that nine-month net profit fell 1.9%--the result of tough competition as well as increased network investments and handset subsidies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was also some weakness in Hong Kong-listed Chinese developers, after the average price of new homes in 70 Chinese cities rose to another fresh high in September. Signs of rising house prices are often taken negatively, as it increases expectations that Beijing could step in to cool down the property market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">China Resources Land</span> fell 1% in Hong Kong and China Overseas Land &amp; Investment dropped 0.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Shanghai Composite fell 0.8% to 2210.65, easing after a strong Monday session, where the index jumped 1.6% after comments from the State Council over the weekend raised expectations for economic reform.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More broadly, investors were looking ahead to the U.S. labor report later in the global day. Nonfarm payrolls has been a closely watched economic indicator in global markets, examined by investors to see whether the U.S. economy is healthy enough for the Federal Reserve to roll back its stimulus program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Expectations were high in September for the central bank to change direction, and markets were taken by surprise when it kept its bond-buying program unchanged. The recent government shutdown in the U.S. has led many to conclude that the stimulus will stay until next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of Asia moved higher ahead of the report, although the gains were limited, with markets sticking close to the break-even mark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar was slightly stronger against the yen at ¥98.31 late in Asia, compared with ¥98.17 late Monday in New York. The weaker yen helped Japanese stocks turn around an earlier loss in the session, with the Nikkei ending up 0.1% to 14713.25.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">South Korea's Kospi added 0.2% to 2056.12, Philippines' PSE Composite added 0.1% to 6603.60, and Thailand's SET was last down 0.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P/ASX 200 rose 0.4% to 5373.10, helped by mining giant <span class="companylink">BHP Billiton</span>, which rose 2.4% after it raised its iron-ore production guidance for the 2014 fiscal year. The firm now expects to produce 212 million metric tons of iron ore, 2.4% above the previous guidance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also in Sydney, retailer David Jones dropped 2.1% after Chief Executive Paul Zahra said Monday that he would resign for personal reasons after the company finds a successor. </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Whirlpool Corp</span>. reported profit more than doubled in the third quarter and increased its forecast for full-year earnings as stronger U.S. housing sales offset weakness in much of the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Benton Harbor, Mich.-based maker of home appliances—whose brands include <span class="companylink">Maytag</span>, KitchenAid and Jenn-Air—benefited from continued strong sales in the U.S., a recovery in the housing market, and modestly better results in Europe. In India and Brazil, though, sales were sluggish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We feel good about the fourth quarter" outlook for U.S. appliance sales, Jeff Fettig, <span class="companylink">Whirlpool</span>'s chief executive officer, said in an interview. The recent federal government shutdown may have hurt consumer confidence, he said, but "at least from what we see it was temporary."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The industry is heading into the Black Friday discounting period, but Mr. Fettig said more manufacturers were being more "sensible" than they were a few years ago and avoiding excessive price cuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Whirlpool</span>, North America's largest maker of appliances, is benefiting from a cost-cutting drive. Over the past two years, the company closed a refrigerator plant in Fort Smith, Ark., and sold a dishwasher factory in Neunkirchen, Germany, among other steps. Those efforts have boosted profit margins. Operating profit was 6.7% of sales in the third quarter, up from 4.7% a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Whirlpool</span> reported profit of $196 million, or $2.42 a share, up from $74 million, or 94 cents a share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, stripping out restructuring costs, tax credits and other items, earnings grew 51% to $2.72 per share from $1.80 a share. Sales rose 4.2% to $4.68 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Whirlpool</span>'s new forecast for 2013 earnings is a range of $10.45 to $10.65 a share, up from the prior range of $10.05 to $10.55. For 2012, <span class="companylink">Whirlpool</span> reported earnings of $5.06 a share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In North America, which accounts for about 55% of <span class="companylink">Whirlpool</span>'s business, sales were up 8% in the latest quarter. For the full year, <span class="companylink">Whirlpool</span> said it expects industrywide shipments of appliances in North America to rise 9%. It previously forecast a rise of 6% to 8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company reported a break-even result in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, compared with a year-earlier operating loss of $36 million. Excluding currency-translation effects, sales grew 5%. For the full year, industry shipments in the region will be about even with 2012, <span class="companylink">Whirlpool</span> projected. Europe appears to be stabilizing, <span class="companylink">Whirlpool</span> executives said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Latin America, <span class="companylink">Whirlpool</span> expects industry shipments to rise just 1% this year, partly due to a cooling of the Brazilian economy. In Asia, it predicts a decline of 2%, mainly because of weakness in India. Mr. Fettig said he remains bullish about the long-term outlook for both India and Brazil.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHANGHAI—Average new-home prices in 70 Chinese cities rose to another fresh high in September, amid signs of panic buying driven by fears that prices will rise further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the ninth consecutive month, prices rose from a year earlier, according to data released by the <span class="companylink">National Bureau of Statistics</span>, despite government control measures. The advance was led by the nation's largest cities. In addition, the pace of increase accelerated for the eighth month in a row.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is some panic-driven demand now, as people have little confidence in the government's commitment to rein in frothy housing prices," said Song Huiyong, research director at Shanghai Centaline Property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Every time a curb is implemented, prices are depressed for a while but then they rebound. Property developers have also been actively buying land at high prices, so that's driving sentiment among home buyers too."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China has been grappling with a resurgent property market that has resisted a string of market curbs, which seek to corral high prices that can fuel social unrest. Authorities have imposed mortgage restrictions and limits on multiple-home purchases on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts and developers have said that they are watching for hints that the government will introduce fresh cooling measures like capital gains and property taxes. But the need to keep the economy humming ahead of a key Communist Party meeting next month has made policy makers cautious about clamping down too hard on the property market, which is a key growth engine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As in August, prices in September were up in 69 of the 70 cities surveyed by the government. Month-on-month price increases moderated slightly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average increase from a year earlier accelerated to 8.19%, from 7.48% in August and 6.70% in July, calculations by The Wall Street Journal showed. The average increase from a month earlier in September was 0.67%, moderating from 0.79% in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In particular, there have been steady increases in home prices in top tier cities—Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou—which offer the best jobs and schools and attract home buyers from the rest of the country. And the pace of increase accelerated in all four cities last month: Average home prices in Beijing were up 16% from a year earlier, beating August's 14.9%. In Guangzhou, the pace increased to 20% from 18.8%; in Shanghai, to 17% from 15.4%; and in Shenzhen, to 19.7% from 18.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shanghai-based architect Andy Lin, has set his sights on his first home in the city, a 64-square-meter apartment in the central Jing An District. "The seller is asking for 3.3 million yuan ($540,000) for the apartment and I'm hoping to get it down a bit," said Mr. Lin. "But I still may take it…Prices are also getting ridiculously high and while I may not be in a rush, I may not be able to afford another home if I delay," he said, adding he had already looked at more than 60 homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average prices in the secondhand housing market in Shanghai rose 12.3% year-over-year, up from August's 11.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a property showroom in the nearby city of Suzhou, sales agents said they have been getting a steady stream of customers looking to buy their European-styled homes, which cost an average of about 3 million yuan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While local residents aren't allowed to purchase a third home, some have skirted the restriction by using the name of a relative or by setting up a company to make the purchase, according to a sales agent who gave her surname as Jing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If the buyer is a company there would be no chance of getting a bank loan and taxes on a resale would be higher," she said. "But still they want to buy property."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a month-over-month basis, prices were up from August in 65 of the cities. Wenzhou and Guilin were the only two cities where prices fell; prices in three cities were unchanged. In August, prices were up from the previous month in 66 cities. Wenzhou, a center of private business and a focus of speculative buying in the past that pushed prices to levels that rivaled levels seen in bigger cities, was also the only city to show a year on year decline. Housing prices in Wenzhou fell 1.7% in September from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property developers—like buyers—are also confident that prices are headed higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I have confidence in Beijing and Shanghai, not just because of strong local demand, but also because these cities attract buyers from all over China," <span class="companylink">Sunac China</span> Chairman Sun Hongbin told a recent briefing. "They will eventually become world-class investment destinations like Hong Kong, New York and Paris." He noted the average selling price of its projects in Shanghai is 60,000 yuan to 70,000 yuan ($9,846 to $11,487) a square meter. That compares with an average price nationally of 10,554 yuan a square meter in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the central government is trying to address China's widening wealth gap and concerns that housing prices are rising beyond the reach of the middle class.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts and government researchers have called on Beijing to try to rein in the real-estate market with more sustainable measures, such as land reform.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is still some room for housing prices to rise, but when the central government does implement these [new] taxes and if the tax rates are high enough to deter investment demand, a correction will be inevitable," said Centaline's Mr. Song.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">U.K. Housing Not a Bubble…Yet; Rest of U.K. Lags Far Behind London Prices</span>
</div><div class="author">Richard Barley </div><div>400 words</div><div>21 October 2013</div><div>06:57</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.K. economy has been surprisingly strong this year. The latest data point is positively startling: the average asking price for a London house rose 10.2% on the month in October to a record £544,432 ($880,183), according to property website Rightmove. The news will fuel the U.K. debate about whether a new housing bubble is getting under way. But most of the data doesn't support that contention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">True, the monthly data is volatile and Rightmove itself says the rise is "unsustainable." The capital is vastly different from the rest of the country, with particularly strong demand from overseas investors. Asking prices are far less buoyant in other regions; the national monthly rise was 2.8%. And although the rise coincides with the introduction of the government's Help to Buy mortgage subsidies, it is unlikely to reflect a direct effect from that program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other indicators of housing activity are relatively limp. The number of mortgages approved in August rose 30.5% year-over-year, Bank of England data show; but at 62,226 they are less than half the precrisis peak. U.K. house prices have fallen 26% from their late 2007 peak in real terms, <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> noted in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the U.K.'s love affair with property shouldn't be underestimated. True, households are still heavily indebted and income growth is poor. But there may be significant pent-up activity to come: the average number of first-home buyers in the last five years is 57% below the average for 1998-2007, according to <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>. And supply is a worry. In 1995-2007, house prices trebled but new housing starts rose by only 25,000 a year, failing to match demand, <span class="companylink">Berenberg Bank</span> notes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the Bank of England holding interest rates at 0.5% for many months to come, plus the Help to Buy program, the risk remains that more and more cash ends up being pumped into housing, an unproductive asset. The U.K. has created conditions for its economy to grow; the question remains as to whether it is healthy growth that sees investment and exports rise or unhealthy, debt-driven growth in consumption. The housing market will play a vital role. The signs from London don't inspire confidence.</p>

</div><div class="author">Eric Morath </div><div>593 words</div><div>21 October 2013</div><div>07:59</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Sales of previously owned homes eased in September, the latest indication that rising mortgage rates are causing the housing market to cool after hitting four-year highs this summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales in September slipped to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.29 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Monday. The 1.9% decline appears modest, but the prior month's pace was revised down sharply to 5.39 million from the previously estimated 5.48 million. Sales now held flat in August after reaching the highest level since late 2009 in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest figures reflect deals that closed in September, meaning buyers made their offers a month or two earlier, when interest rates were nearing their peak levels for the year. In late August the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage reached 4.58%, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. That level was a full percentage point higher than mid-May rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With interest rates still elevated and home prices rising, it's more expensive for families to purchase a house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, chief economist of the Realtors group, said the summer levels are likely a cyclical high and predicts that existing home sales in 2014 will hold flat compared to this year, which would end a four-year streak of annual increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Lower affordability will hamper home sales going forward," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weaker figures are consistent with other measures of the housing sector that shows a slowing due to increased interest rates. The September data, however, don't fully reflect several important developments for the housing market in recent weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest rates have eased more than a quarter percentage point during the past month after the Federal Reserve announced on Sept. 18 that it wouldn't be lowering its amount of monthly bond purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Lower interest rates compliments of an accommodative Fed will help increase affordability and help resume the housing recovery, which has been a key source of strength for the overall economy," said Sterne Agee Chief Economist Lindsey M. Piegza.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The September home sales would have come well before a government shutdown and debt-ceiling fight weighed on the minds of many consumers. Mr. Yun said the Washington gridlock could have "negatively impact" October closings, but the degree is difficult to measure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Uncertainty over the debt ceiling may have made some would-be buyers skittish, but moderating interest rates could entice shoppers back into the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, existing home sales are 10.7% higher than a year earlier. However, that year-over-year gain is the smallest since the spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest data showed prices also continued to rise, but a slower pace than in previous months. The median price of an existing home was $199,200, up 11.7% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gain partially reflects increasing sales for homes priced at $500,000 or more and declining sales for properties costing less than $100,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories held flat from a month earlier at 2.21 million at the end of September. Compared to a year ago, inventories are up slightly, the first year-over-year gain in 2½ years. The inventory represents a 5-month supply at the current sales pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Limited inventory and fewer distressed sales are helping to keep upward pressure on house prices," said <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span> economist Daniel Silver.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON—Home sellers in London raised asking prices 10% in the early weeks of October, as foreign buyers continued stoking the market, adding to concern a fresh property bubble may be forming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The capital's steep price increases have also fueled concern among policy makers that many residents may be forced out of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bloomberg News A row of multiple-storey terraced luxury houses in London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This phenomenon has helped…to fuel the anger of professional people who cannot afford to live in districts where their parents grew up and who cannot see how their kids will ever be able to afford to buy in London," said the city's mayor, Boris Johnson, in an editorial in the Daily Telegraph.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he rejected the idea of imposing a special levy on homes above a certain value—the so-called Mansion Tax favored by Liberal Democrats, the junior members of the ruling coalition led by his Conservative Party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average asking price for a London home advertised via online real estate agency Rightmove's website surged by £50,484 ($81,617) to a record-high £544,232 in October. By contrast, house prices rose between 1% and 4% in most of England and Wales, falling in two regions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A survey by the <span class="companylink">Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors</span> released Tuesday showed that while house building across the U.K. is beginning to pick up, it is far from levels needed to meet the demands of a growing population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While it's certainly good news that…house building is finally on the rise right across the U.K., we are certainly not out of the woods yet," said Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at RICS. "Critically, we're still way behind in terms of building enough homes to meet the nation's growing housing need."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, Mr. Johnson called for construction of more homes, while noting that meeting demand would take many years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his first speech since joining the <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span>'s Financial Policy Committee in April, Martin Taylor said controlling house-price increases shouldn't be the job of a regulator but that the body will monitor any developing threat to the financial system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are watching for signs of overextension on the part of the banks and the public, especially signs that borrowers weren't in a position to withstand an eventual rise in interest rates, signs in general that a more speculative market might be developing. These might be expected to attract our attention." Mr. Taylor said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics say the government's decision to launch a second phase of its Help-to-Buy program, under which it provides guarantees to support potential buyers with small deposits in getting a mortgage, is adding to the problem. The government says the scheme will generate an increase in badly needed home building, but it has asked the <span class="companylink">FPC</span> to conduct an annual review to ensure it isn't threatening a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Taylor said that along with low interest rates, the government's scheme had provided "some vigorous facilitation of demand."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span>'s deputy governor for financial stability, Jon Cunliffe, last week said the committee could act to counter surging house prices in London and elsewhere if it sees a threat to the banking system. "I think it goes back to the question of whether this movement in house prices is causing a threat to financial stability as a whole," Jon Cunliffe told lawmakers. "If it is, then the <span class="companylink">FPC</span> would need to find a way of addressing it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regardless of policy makers' comments, signs point to further increases in the cost of a London home, even if not as dramatic as the October rise in asking prices. "There won't be another 10% rise next month," said Miles Shipside, Rightmove's director and housing market analyst. "That's not to say we won't see some further rises in London, because there's still momentum, and there's still a shortage of supply."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, if more sellers move to cash in on the appreciation of their homes "and there's more availability of stock, then that could slow down the rate of the [price] increase," Mr. Shipside added.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many condominium developers who rode out the real-estate downturn by renting out their units are reverting to for-sale housing, in another sign of the market's continued recovery over the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take Amir Haber, a Los Angeles developer who opened his Universal Lofts project at precisely the wrong moment in late 2008, when the stock market was in free fall and home prices were declining at a double-digit pace. Instead of selling off the project's 67 lofts that range from 2,000 to 2,500 square feet and sit across the highway from Universal Studios, Mr. Haber converted them into high-end rentals that range from about $3,800 to $5,500 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, things are turning around: Early this year a tenant asked if he could buy his unit. That deal, for $1.3 million, has since closed, and Mr. Haber said several more units will soon be in escrow. "I knew the market would come back," Mr. Haber said. "It was just a matter of when."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During much of the recession and its aftermath, as condos fell out of favor and apartment rents rose in the wake of foreclosures, new apartments outpaced new condos. Now, in big markets from San Francisco to South Florida, "Condos for sale" signs are popping up at a steady pace as the improving housing market creates an opening for landlords to sell off rental housing. That hot market also is spurring new construction of condo buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, some 2,080 apartments were converted to condos from rentals. That is a pittance from the 152,206 conversions that took place in 2005 when the real-estate bubble was inflating, but it was the highest total since 2008, according to property researcher <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>., which tracks only those buildings with 40 or more units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers are muted because the apartment market remains strong and because the bulk of today's conversions are different from the boom years and should probably be called "reversions." That is, the developers had always planned to sell the units as condominiums but were unable to find takers during the real-estate bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's different from 2005 or 2006 when [investors] would buy an apartment building, kick everyone out and put a condo map on it," said Shlomi Ronen, managing principal of Dekel Capital in Los Angeles of today's conversions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reversions are being driven by a supply shortage in the single-family-home market, which has sent prices upward. There were 2.07 million existing homes for sale at the end of August, up 5.1% from January but still down about 6% from a year ago, according data from the National Association of Realtors and Trulia, a real-estate listings site. The data include both condos and single-family homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condos aren't likely to perform as strongly as they did in the boom years. Mortgage-lending standards are still very tight. To sell units, developers have relied heavily on buyers that can pay cash and are often investing instead of living in the units full-time. Typically, developers need to sell out a certain share of units in a building before banks can make loans that are eligible for sale to <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the government-controlled mortgage-finance giants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many recent conversions have been in the San Francisco Bay area, where the booming tech sector and a dearth of homes for sale have led to a jump in home prices. The Bond, an Oakland rental project that recently started selling its units as condos, is one such reversion. Michael Reynolds, managing principal at Bond Street Advisors, which developed the project, said that with housing inventory tight, it is a good time to make the switch, and the company has already sold 40 of the 101 units this year. "There is no inventory," Mr. Reynolds said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few places have seen as big of a turnaround as South Florida. As of the second week of October, there were about 21,000 condos and townhomes for sale across Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties. That was down 66% from the fourth quarter of 2008, according to multiple-listing-service data compiled by Condo Vultures Realty, but up about 14% from a June low of about 18,000 listings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the bust, buildings such as Miami's Nordica condo project, completed in 2007, took in renters while the prices were falling. At first, developer Astor Cos. had trouble even renting out the roughly half of the building's 130 units that hadn't been sold. Peter Torres, a vice president at Astor, says rental prices were around $1.50 a square foot before climbing to a high of about $3 as the overhang of unsold condos began to thin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, Astor is again selling condos, and building new ones. In May, Astor put the 59 remaining units on the market for between $300,000 and $600,000. Mr. Torres said Astor has sold about half of them. The company is putting up a new condo building in nearby Coral Gables with sale prices ranging from about $250,000 to about $1.2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What I don't think people envisioned is the pace at which the population is increasing and how quickly the units from the last cycle would be absorbed," Mr. Torres said. "People thought the recovery would be stretched out much longer, maybe 10 years, and it's obviously been sooner than a lot of us expected."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sanette Tanaka   </div><div>755 words</div><div>18 October 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M13</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let the buyer beware: This house might be haunted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Simone Murray thought she found her ideal home in Zionsville, Ind. "Everything was perfect. It was secluded, nestled in beautiful trees," says Ms. Murray, vice president of member services at an Indianapolis-based nonprofit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the cemetery in the backyard stopped her: "There were headstones on the property," she says. "We decided not to consider it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although research shows that most people don't believe in ghosts, many still balk at the thought of buying a "haunted house." In an online survey conducted by Realtor.com, 38% of the 1,410 respondents said they would reject buying a house that was perceived to be haunted. Of those who would consider buying a haunted house, three-fourths would expect a price reduction because of the stigma, the survey found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Murray's real-estate agent, Diane Brooks of the FC Tucker Co., says half of her clients don't care if a property is near headstones. "They know a cemetery is beautiful and will be well maintained," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While most states require sellers to disclose physical issues, only some require sellers to disclose psychological issues, like if a house is stigmatized. A house perceived to have ghosts could fall under that category, says Ilona Bray, real-estate editor of Nolo, a publisher of consumer legal guides based in Berkeley, Calif. "Let's say you think your house is haunted. If you find out there was a horrible murder, or someone's body was left in the attic, that could matter. That property could be stigmatized. And that could materially affect the value of the house," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Hunter, a real-estate agent with William Raveis Real Estate in Sudbury, Mass., says once clients hear that a house is believed to be haunted, 90% of the time, they pass. But there are the rare few who seek out haunted homes, he adds. In the Realtor.com survey, 12% of the respondents said they would pay a home's full market value or more if they believed a house was haunted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People are more likely to believe a house is haunted if experts express their support, says Paul Brewer, professor in the department of communication at the <span class="companylink">University of Delaware</span>, who studies beliefs about the paranormal. "If a house has a reputation, with media coverage presented as credible or even scientific, that can shape people's beliefs and shape people's perception," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some agents cast these properties in a positive light, focusing on their historical significance or interesting architecture, says Leslie Piper, Realtor.com's consumer-housing specialist and an agent with Pacific Union in Lafayette, Calif. "It's a fine line," she says. "What's spooky to one person might be intriguing to another."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GROSSE POINTE, Mich. -- Just outside Detroit, where thousands of homes are being sold this week at auction for as little as $500, real estate is hot again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After years of slow sales and depressed prices, homes here in some of the wealthiest communities around the Motor City now receive multiple offers as inventory shrinks. Prospective buyers often carry big wads of cash, and some of the most sought-after properties change hands in secret "whisper listings," according to local brokers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the city of Detroit has run out of money, many home buyers in the region appear to be taking little notice. "You try to get your people in the house the day it lists because it might sell right away," said Pat Chasteen, a real-estate agent with Monaghan GMAC in Grosse Pointe Farms. She spent nearly every night last week closing deals and met her first client Friday at 6:30 a.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five years ago, when auto sales crashed and two of the Detroit Three auto makers filed for bankruptcy, car plants closed, thousands lost their jobs and those who held on were stripped of pay, benefits, and bonuses. But in recent years, the car companies have posted record profits, while salaried and union workers have collected some of their biggest bonus checks in history. Home prices are rising here as fast as any major metropolitan market in the country, attracting some new investors, said Jed Kolko, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, a real-estate website.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, Detroit and its suburbs are still digging out of a big hole. The region's housing lost about 36% of its value during the recession, and its value remains 28% below prerecession levels, according to housing and mortgage-refinancing data tracked by the <span class="companylink">Southeast Michigan Council of Governments</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the Detroit region is still seeing little new residential construction. And the market has the nation's highest home-vacancy rate after suffering from two decades of the country's worst job losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have a long way to go, but I think we're starting to turn a corner," said Brian Parthum, economic analyst at the Southeast Michigan council.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What we know is that during the housing boom, Detroit did not do nearly as well as the rest of the country and suffered more on the way down," said Craig Lazzara, senior director, S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. "But it's had a much bigger bounce off the most recent bottom."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Increasingly, it is a tale of two Detroits, the beleaguered city in bankruptcy court with few jobs and abundant vacant property, and the larger metropolitan region bouncing back gradually with falling unemployment and rising home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across four counties that comprise metro Detroit, the median home price jumped 48% in September over a year ago, and the number of sales rose 7%, according to sales figures compiled by Realcomp, a multiple-listing service in Farmington Hills, Mich.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's like someone turned off the water five years ago and just turned it back on," said John Hannett, a real-estate agent based in the tony northern suburb of Birmingham who has sold property for almost a half-century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the upswing touches few places in the city of Detroit, where state-appointed leaders filed for bankruptcy protection in July, citing an estimated $18 billion in long-term debt. Sales in the city last month fell 13% compared with the same month a year ago. The median sales price of a home in Detroit last month was $11,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agents say sales are up in the city's downtown and nearby Midtown but that potential buyers are often frustrated by Detroit's high taxes, spotty public safety, shaky public schools and antiquated assessment system that often overvalues property and prevents traditional financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I was very apprehensive about which areas were safe, but I never really wanted to move out of Detroit," said Lisa Card, a 41-year-old special-education teacher and mother of two who moved back from the suburbs and closed in August on a $74,000, three-bedroom, bank-owned house on the city's east side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosures continue to haunt the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This fall, Wayne County is trying to sell at auction 18,000 properties -- 90% in Detroit -- on which taxes weren't paid for at least three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first round of the auction, only 880 were sold. In the final round of the auction ending Oct. 25, bids start as low as $500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics say the massive auction keeps real-estate prices in the city low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And new buyers often fail to pay taxes, pushing the properties back into tax foreclosure, said the county's chief deputy treasurer, David Szymanski.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Alessia Pirolo   </div><div>697 words</div><div>16 October 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>19</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign investors are showing a growing appetite for Italian commercial real estate, a sign that the gradual improvement of the European economy is being felt in some of the Continent's weaker property markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From January through early October, the volume of Italian cross-border transactions totaled 2.75 billion euros ($3.71 billion), or about 79% of all commercial real-estate transactions in Italy so far this year, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is the largest amount of foreign investment in Italian commercial real estate since 2007, though it still is only half that year's total, says Joseph Kelly, a European analyst at <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With overall confidence in the euro zone rising, investors are becoming more willing to buy into riskier countries such as Spain and Italy, experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Now that the euro-zone crisis is no longer as relevant, people look to Italy. It has a real economy and good quality assets," says Stephen Screene, chief operating officer of European capital markets at <span class="companylink">Cushman &amp; Wakefield Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyers in the biggest deals of 2013 are investors who haven't bought property in Italy since before the global financial crisis, or ever. For example, in early October <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>, which hadn't purchased property in Italy since 2007, said it had acquired a majority stake in 13 Italian shopping malls and two retail parks in a deal valued at about 635 million euros.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allianz Real Estate's acquisition last May of two office buildings in Milan and Rome was its first investment in Italy since 2008. Following this roughly 90 million euro deal, the German insurance company is planning further investments worth about 500 million euros, according to Mauro Montagner, CEO of Allianz Real Estate Italy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors say that in havens such as London, Paris, Germany and Sweden, prices have jumped in some cases to prerecession levels, making investments less appealing. Investors buying properties in those markets are accepting initial yields as low as 5%, analysts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, in the second quarter of 2013, yields in Europe's harder-hit markets such as Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Greece were on average 7.3% for retail property and 8.4% for office property, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the end of 2013, about two thirds of the year's deals will have involved foreign buyers, says Alessandro Mazzanti, chief executive <span class="companylink">CBRE Group Inc</span>.'s Italian division. This is about double the average between 2009 and 2012, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, <span class="companylink">Qatar Holding LLC</span>, which before 2012 was completely absent from the Italian market, closed on a 40% stake of Porta Nuova, a 2 billion euro mixed-use development in Milan, the largest transaction this year in Italy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Qatar Holding</span>'s move piqued the interest of foreign investors, says Manfredi Catella, CEO of Hines Italia SGR, the developer of Porta Nuova.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newly interested foreign investors include U.S. private-equity firms <span class="companylink">Cerberus Capital Management LP</span>, <span class="companylink">KKR &amp; Co</span>. and Oaktree Capital Management, Mr. Catella says. In particular, Cerberus is close to completing two transactions for a value that could reach 400 million euros, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span>, which in recent months has invested in shopping centers across northern Italy, is in exclusive talks to buy the historic Milan headquarters of the heavily indebted Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera for 120 million euros, according to people familiar with the matter. <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> didn't respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But not everyone in Italy is eager to see real estate sold to foreign buyers. After the announcement of the possible sale of the building that has been Corriere's home since 1904, the paper's union of journalists called a strike.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, many foreign investors are deterred by an Italian political and economic system that they say lacks transparency and a clear set of rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is important that the government should adopt laws to erase rules that penalize real estate," says Massimo Caputi, vice chairman of the Italian real-estate management firm <span class="companylink">Prelios SpA</span>.</p>

</div><div class="author">Sarah Portlock </div><div>630 words</div><div>16 October 2013</div><div>10:20</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—The U.S. economy expanded at a "modest to moderate" pace in recent months, though uncertainty from fiscal deadlock in Washington was felt throughout the country, according to the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s survey of regional economic conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central bank's "beige book" report, released Wednesday, found eight of 12 districts reporting steady growth rates from the summer and four districts indicating slower expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Contacts across districts generally remained cautiously optimistic in their outlook for future economic activity," the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, "many also noted an increase in uncertainty due largely to the federal government shutdown and debt-ceiling debate."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economic snapshot was prepared by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago</span> and is based on anecdotal information from other regional banks gathered through Oct. 7. It comes two weeks before the Fed's Oct. 29 and 30 policy meeting and may be one of a diminished number of data points the central bank has to determine the state of the economy. The partial government shutdown since Oct. 1 has shuttered the agencies that produce major economic reports. Already, the Labor and Commerce departments have postponed publishing data covering employment, inflation from consumer-price data, and retail sales, among others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">The Fed</span> determined at its last policy meeting that the economy still needed support and continued its $85 billion-a-month bond-buying stimulus program, aimed at lowering borrowing costs and encouraging hiring and spending. The central bank pointed to risks and uncertainty in the economy as reasons to leave its program unchanged, according to minutes released last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were several bright spots in Wednesday's report that could indicate growth. Many districts pointed to continued increases in consumer spending, activity in the travel and tourism sector and residential construction, the report said. Business spending and payrolls grew in many districts, as well as manufacturing activity. Financial conditions were "little changed" on balance, with lending activity remaining modest in most districts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Auto sales were strong for the period in some areas, particularly in New York. But the Chicago, Kansas City and Dallas districts reported slower growth in auto sales. Retail spending picked up in the Cleveland and Richmond districts, but slowed in the Chicago, Kansas City and Dallas areas. Back-to-school spending was lower than a year ago in Chicago and Atlanta, but retailers generally remained optimistic about the holiday-shopping season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tourism groups in the Boston and Richmond districts pointed to the government shutdown, which started Oct. 1, as having some impact on local attractions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employment growth remained modest in September. Several districts said employers were cautious to expand payrolls because of uncertainty around the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and fiscal policies in general. In the Cleveland and Dallas areas, retail hiring was primarily limited to staffing new stores. New positions at manufacturing facilities in Boston were largely to fill key needs or replace former workers. New York noted slower job growth, according to the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential construction "increased moderately on balance," growing at a stronger pace in the Minneapolis and Dallas districts but only slightly in Richmond and Philadelphia. Home sales and prices continued to rise and inventories remained low in most districts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, "a number" of districts reported concerns from homebuilders and realtors over rising mortgage rates. In Boston, there are signs of a boost to activity by homeowners anticipating future increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall loan growth remained modest in most areas, while consumer loan demand weakened slightly, the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price pressures remained limited in September, with most districts reporting only slight increases in commodity prices and limited ability to pass those increases to customers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many U.S. banks are starting to see new growth from the old business of commercial-real-estate loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From office buildings to shopping centers to warehouses to apartments, lending to developers and owners of such properties is on the rebound because of rising real-estate values and improved credit quality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of June 30, U.S. banks had $991.2 billion in total commercial-real-estate loans, up 3.3% from a year earlier, according to research firm SNL Financial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co</span>. on Friday reported that outstanding commercial-real-estate loans rose to $61.5 billion in the third quarter, a 12% increase from a year earlier. "The commercial-real-estate business continues to grow strongly," J.P. Morgan Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said during a conference call with analysts, noting loans have increased "every month for the last 13 months."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors and analysts will be looking for more clues when <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>. reports quarterly results on Wednesday. <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo &amp; Co</span>. on Friday reported relatively flat commercial-real-estate lending in the U.S. for the third quarter. Other banks slated to report results this week include large commercial-real-estate lenders <span class="companylink">U.S. Bancorp</span> and <span class="companylink">PNC Financial Services Group Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"More banks are now on the offense, not on defense anymore, when it comes to commercial real estate," said Anthony Polini, a banking-sector analyst with <span class="companylink">Raymond James Financial Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total commercial-real-estate loans outstanding by U.S. banks declined to $950 billion in 2011, a 25% plunge from 2008, according to SNL.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year's 2.4% rise in total commercial-real-estate loans to $972.7 billion was the first growth in four years, according to SNL. Analysts said the lending rebound, still in its early stages, is being fueled largely by one area: apartment projects. The boom could start to peter out as the single-family housing market recovers, but for now banks are eager to keep lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial real estate is "definitely becoming a significant driver of loan growth," said Kevin Barker, an analyst with Compass Point Research &amp; Trading. "To the extent that the banks can take advantage, it could be a tailwind to earnings."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial-real-estate properties include office buildings, retail complexes, industrial properties and apartments. Lending to developers and owners of such properties fell out of favor when the economy went south but has become a focus again for many banks as conditions have improved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the market has gotten more heated as banks ramp up commercial-real-estate lending, analysts said financial institutions are more cautious about the type of loans they make to property developers and owners. Loan pricing "is getting beaten down," but "there's less speculative lending" today than before the market downturn, Mr. Polini said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regulators have increased their scrutiny of banks' exposure to commercial property in recent years, which is likely to cause lenders to be conservative as they increase their portfolios, analysts said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rebound in the commercial-property market has helped bolster lending activity. After bottoming out in 2009, commercial-property values rose 44% through August and were down just 14% from the peak reached in 2007, according to the <span class="companylink">Moody's</span>/RCA Commercial Property Price Indices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartment property prices, specifically,had increased 13% over the past year as of August, but growth has slowed in recent months, according to the <span class="companylink">Moody's</span>/RCA report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction activity also has picked up, with new commercial-construction starts estimated to increase 15% this year, after having risen 12% last year, according to an October report from <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Ratings Services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Production of new multifamily properties increased in the second quarter, according to a <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> index, which rose nine points from the first quarter to 61 on a 100-point scale. It was the highest level reached since the index was established in 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recovery is prompting some banks to make acquisitions to seize on growth opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">UnionBanCal Corp</span>., which is part of <span class="companylink">Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc</span>., in April said it was acquiring a commercial-real estate business from <span class="companylink">PB Capital Corp</span>., a subsidiary of <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank AG</span>. The deal included a $3.7 billion loan portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal was driven by subsidiary Union Bank's desire to beef up its real-estate presence nationally, said Michael Stedman, senior executive vice president and head of commercial banking and real estate for San Francisco-based Union Bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The competitive environment has been increasingly challenging," Mr. Stedman said, adding that Union Bank is focused on expanding its commercial real-estate lending business organically but would consider doing more deals if they fit with the company's growth plans.</p>

</div><div class="author">Paul Hannon  </div><div>596 words</div><div>15 October 2013</div><div>03:41</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON—A member of the <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span>'s rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee Tuesday said he is "concerned" about the U.K. housing market after official figures showed house prices accelerated in August to hit their highest level on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices across the U.K. rose 0.5% in August from July and were up 3.8% from a year earlier, the fastest annual increase since October 2010. That left the index of prices at its highest level since records began in 1968, the <span class="companylink">Office for National Statistics</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking to lawmakers, MPC member Martin Weale said that while it is never clear whether a housing bubble has developed until after it has burst, he was "concerned" by the "elevated" level of prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People who are taking on mortgage debt need to be sure they can look after it even if interest rates return to normal levels," Mr. Weale said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added that one warning sign would be if "people are buying houses because of the expectation that house prices will continue to rise at a rapid rate," and said an increase in the number of houses purchased with the intention of renting them out could be one alarm signal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weale's comments come a day after the BOE's incoming deputy governor for financial stability said that while he doesn't think the U.K. is in the throes of a house-price bubble, he would favor action to cool the property market if there was a risk to banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In testimony to lawmakers ahead of joining the BOE on November 1, John Cunliffe said that while house prices have risen rapidly this year, and homeowners and potential buyers seem to expect similarly rapid rises in the future, the fact that price rises have been "patchy" across the country suggests there isn't yet a bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cunliffe will play a key role in deciding when and how to employ new tools given to the central bank's Financial Policy Committee that are intended to prevent a recurrence of the 2008 financial crisis. He said that he would be prepared to take action to damp mortgage lending if there were evidence that a bubble was developing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If I thought a housing bubble was there, or if things in the housing market were causing risks to build up in the financial sector, then we would want to use the FPC's tools," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">U.K. government</span> last week launched the controversial second phase of its mortgage-guarantee program which will provide home buyers with a government guarantee for a proportion of their mortgage to an aggregate limit of £12 billion ($19.14 billion). The program was brought forward by three months, having initially been scheduled for launch in January 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing experts fear that the program will fuel demand before there is time to build new homes, and lead to a sharp increase in prices that could lead to problems for borrowers and lenders in coming years, repeating a pattern that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treasury chief George Osborne last month asked the <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span> to make an annual assessment of the impact of the program, including whether that price cap needs to be lowered, or whether the fees charged to lenders under the program may need to rise.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The popularity of a tiny sliver of Brooklyn among the Sephardic Jewish community has pushed some of the home prices there to among the borough's highest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The borough's Gravesend section is primarily known as a diverse, middle-class neighborhood, and the median home price there is slightly below the median for all of Brooklyn. But in the part of Gravesend where the Sephardic Jewish community lives, some large, single-family homes are selling for several million dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers said prices hinge not only on how big a house is, but also on its proximity to area synagogues and Jewish community centers. They say it isn't uncommon for buyers to purchase relatively modest or outdated houses in order to tear them down and build new residences that allow for easy walks on the Sabbath.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At present, the highest-priced listing in the area, according to real-estate listing website StreetEasy.com, is a seven-bedroom house on Ocean Parkway with an asking price of $8.99 million. The house was initially listed for $14 million in 2012, and if it had fetched that price it would have been one of the most expensive homes to ever sell in Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A number of homes in Gravesend have already been among the most expensive to ever sell in the borough: One house on Avenue S sold for $10.25 million in 2011; another on the same avenue sold for $11 million in 2003; and one on East 2nd Street went for $10.26 million in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those are rarified numbers for real estate in Brooklyn, where only a handful of home sales have ever been above the $10-million mark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Today Gravesend is the heart of the largest Sephardic Jewish community in the United States," Avi Spitzer, the executive director of the nonprofit Sephardic Community Federation, wrote in an email. "The community has grown because we have built schools, synagogues, facilities and social service agencies to serve the community's needs."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Spitzer said the city's Sephardic Jewish community moved from Manhattan's Lower East Side to Bensonhurst, which borders Gravesend, in the early 1900s, and migrated to Gravesend in the 1940s. Approximately 30,000 Sephardic Jews live in the neighborhood, he said, and many more live in adjacent neighborhoods such as Midwood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most in-demand blocks in the neighborhood are concentrated in a small, tree-lined enclave from Avenue S to Avenue U, between McDonald and Coney Island avenues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ocean Parkway is the main thoroughfare running through the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of Gravesend's housing stock consists of single-family homes built in the mid-20th century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you take some of these houses and put them anywhere else in Brooklyn, you would not get the same prices for them," said Athanasia DiMaggio, who grew up in the neighborhood and is a broker with the firm Re/Max at the Slope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all of Gravesend, according to data gathered by StreetEasy.com, the median price for sales in the third quarter of this year was $465,000, below the Brooklyn median of $495,000 in the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frank Lupi, the owner of the real-estate firm Wolf Properties, which is based in Gravesend, said, "I sell all over Brooklyn but this is the mecca of real estate. This is where the property values are worth most."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some residents in the community believe that the city's plans to put a waste-transfer station on Gravesend Bay -- which is situated in neighboring Bensonhurst -- could affect property values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Many in the Sephardic community don't live close, but they are concerned about the negative impact in terms of quality of life and the value of their homes," said William Colton, the New York state assemblyman whose district includes Gravesend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Colton and other community leaders fear that the dredging that will need to take place in order to accommodate the station has the potential to reintroduce toxins buried dozens of feet below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A municipal incinerator operated on the site between the mid-1950s and 1989, said Mr. Colton, and there is worry that potentially carcinogenic chemicals will be released into the environment when dredging occurs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Southern Brooklyn needs an investment in infrastructure, new schools and better transportation," said Mr. Colton. "Not a garbage station."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to a spokeswoman for the Department of Sanitation, sampling performed by the city "shows that dredging will also remove some of the contaminated sediments in Gravesend Bay and expose a new, cleaner layer of sediment."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said the dredging will comply with a permit from the state Department of Environmental Conservation, "including the use of an environmental bucket and reduced hoist speeds, to minimize water quality impacts and protect natural resources."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city said that work on the project is pending a construction contract but is expected this fall. If the contract is registered next month, construction of the waste-transfer station could begin by late December or early January; the project is expected to be finished in late 2016.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Stefanos Chen   </div><div>1380 words</div><div>11 October 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bella Ross lives on one of the most infamous landmarks in American history: the site of the 1804 duel between secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton and sitting Vice President Aaron Burr, which mortally wounded one and turned the other into a fugitive. Or at least she lives near it, probably.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When she and her husband, John, decided to list their Weehawken, N.J., property, their real-estate agents created an eight-page brochure inviting prospective buyers to "own a part of American history." "We wanted to give it a nice flavoring -- it's not just another mansion," said Helena Lobo-Zagorski, one of the listing agents with Prominent Properties Sotheby's International Realty, adding that words like "historical" are powerful in luxury real estate. The couple's 7,000-square-foot, recently built home went on the market in May for $6.95 million; it was previously listed at $7.5 million in 2010, and taken off the market in January, 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that the high-end housing market is improving, more homeowners and brokers are spinning old yarns to sell new listings, with mixed results. While a select few properties command a hefty premium for their links to mainstay architects and A-list celebrities -- a New York townhouse designed by architect Stanford White sold for $42 million last year -- many others claim a place in the annals of Americana to stand out from the crowd.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span> launched a historic homes section on its luxury listings website. John Passerini, vice president of interactive marketing, said the section was created because searches for such homes are growing; in 1 1/2 months, the section had about 38,000 property views. "During the economic downturn, real estate was totally practical, and it was not romantic," said Jud Henderson, a managing member of Callaway Henderson Sotheby's International Realty based in Princeton, N.J. Now that prices are rising, buyers have the confidence to shop with their emotions again, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in today's ad-saturated, marketing-savvy environment, the standard of what might be considered "historic" has grown more generous, encompassing sites where events might (or might not) have taken place, and including lesser events that don't make most textbooks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marketing for the Patterson Mansion, a roughly 36,400-square-foot home in Washington, D.C., plays up the fact that President Calvin Coolidge stayed there while the White House was under renovation in 1927. It is listed for $26 million, but "would just be square footage," without its historic pedigree, and would therefore list for a fraction of the price without it, said Michael Rankin, principal and managing partner of TTR Sotheby's International Realty, which has the listing. He added that historic homes can command around 20% more than comparable new homes on a price per-square-foot basis in the Georgetown area of D.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Beverly Hills, Calif., a 1941 home designed by Paul R. Williams, a prominent African-American architect, was built for Bert Lahr, who played the Cowardly Lion in "The Wizard of Oz." The home passed on to Betty Grable, Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson before being bought by current owner Guy Attal, president of fashion company Fabrizio Gianni, in 1999 for $2.55 million, according to public records. Mr. Attal, 61, has since doubled the size of the home to roughly 12,000 square feet and added a guesthouse and two-lane bowling alley, he said. While the compound was built out in a similar style to the Williams home, less than half of the space is technically "historic."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the property is listed for $25.58 million, with prominent mentions in the marketing materials of its prior celebrity owners. While it has remained on the market since November 2012, listing agent Joyce Rey of Coldwell Banker Previews International said the property is leased through December at $100,000 a month. Ms. Rey admitted that it can be hard to assess the value of a celebrity connection, especially in star-studded Beverly Hills, but in the case of Mr. Attal's property the name-dropping has helped generate leads. "It gives them certain bragging rights," she said of prospective buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The demand for more obscure and increasingly complicated history reports on homes is leading some real-estate agents to seek out home genealogists. According to Kenyatta Berry, president of the Association of Professional Genealogists, the number of members who claim researching home history as a specialty has grown from 5% to about 10% year over year, in part because home sellers see the value in historic provenance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tim Gregory, a Pasadena, Calif.-based historian known as the Building Biographer, has been in the business for 20 years but said this has been his best year since the recession. He charges brokers and homeowners about $500 for historical reports and $1,000 or more for more detailed narratives. He has been credited by clients with discovering homes designed by prominent Southern California architect Wallace Neff, Paul Williams, and trailblazing designer and builder Anna Latham.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there is the Weehawken, N.J. property and its possible link to the Hamilton-Burr duel. While many historians agree that the home is located somewhere in the vicinity of the duel (the house is on Hamilton Avenue), the exact location is disputable, said Lauren Sherman, chairperson of the Weehawken Historical Commission, partially because the story has been retold and recast in popular history. Adding to the confusion is a bust of Hamilton. Located near the house, it is said to be where he laid his head after being shot (also untrue, Ms. Sherman said). Stuart Fisk Johnson, president of the Aaron Burr Association, believes that the true location of the duel is about one-eighth of a mile away, near the New Jersey side of the Lincoln Tunnel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Ross, who previously lived in Princeton, N.J., said whether her home is precisely on the site or not, she still appreciates the uniqueness of the story. "In Princeton, everything was 'Washington slept here, and Washington slept there.' It became a joke." So far, she said, most prospects have been international buyers who aren't interested in the stories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes a house can have historical value, but the nature of that history can make it nearly unsalable. Stigmatizing events such as violent crimes can stick to a home for years. A murder -- even one long in the past -- might cause a loss of value of 15% to 25%, said Randall Bell, an appraiser with Bell Anderson &amp; Sanders in Laguna Beach, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Miami Beach, Fla., Peter L. Corsell, a 35-year-old tech entrepreneur, didn't bat an eye when he heard his 1920s, 6,100-square-foot Mediterranean home with 100 feet of waterfront overlooking Biscayne Bay was owned by gangster Al Capone, or that Mr. Capone died in the home from complications with syphilis. Mr. Corsell started reading books about the one-time bootlegger and chatted with neighbors about Mr. Capone's softer side: Neighbors told him Mr. Capone entertained orphans at the home and hosted Catholic charity events.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mr. Corsell decided to sell the home earlier this year, he said he wouldn't consider offers from buyers seeking to tear down the home and start over on the 30,000-square-foot lot. "It gave me great personal joy to save it," he said. He sold the home for about $7.5 million to a French buyer, down from an original asking price of $9.5 million. (The new owner was more interested in the architecture than Mr. Capone, he said.) Had he torn it down and built new, he said he could have gotten double that. One of the listing agents, Jill Hertzberg of the Jills Team at Coldwell Banker, said a nearby property of the same lot size with a home built in 2004 sold for $14.5 million.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON—Output in Britain's construction sector fell unexpectedly in August, the latest official data to cast doubt on business surveys that have indicated economic growth picked up strongly in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Office for National Statistics</span> on Friday said construction output fell 0.1% between August and July, after production rose 2.8% the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists had been expecting output to rise 1.6% on the month in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday's data showed construction output increased 4.0% compared with the corresponding period a year earlier. However, this was also weaker than expected, after economists forecast an annual increase of 5.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The construction figures are the third batch of official data this week that have been considerably weaker than expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, the ONS released two sets of figures showing output from British factories fell in August and that the country's trade performance was disappointing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These figures contrast with private-sector business surveys, which have indicated economic growth picked-up in the third quarter after expanding at an annualized rate of 2.9% in the previous quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span> on Tuesday raised its forecast for the U.K., saying it now expects the economy to expand 1.4% in 2013, compared with an earlier forecast of 0.9% published in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ONS will release its first estimate of third quarter GDP on Oct. 25.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alan Clarke, director of fixed income strategy at Scotiabank in London, said while the overall economy should still produce a solid performance in the third quarter, the official data had reduced expectations for a significant rise in growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The surveys made things look we were going gangbusters. We're not doing badly, but we're not doing as spectacularly as we had hoped," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investec cut its forecast for third quarter gross domestic product to 0.8% from 1.0%, and <span class="companylink">JP Morgan</span> cuts it forecast to 0.7% from 0.8%, as a result of the figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our broad observation is that the <span class="companylink">Office for National Statistics</span> figures have not quite kept pace with the survey data on which we had based some of our predictions," said Philip Shaw, an economist at Investec in London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sterling fell against the dollar, dropping to the day's low of $1.5972 soon after the data was released from $1.5985. In the past 10 days the pound has dropped from $1.6259—its highest level against the dollar since Jan. 2.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Basing their expectations on survey data, investors expected the <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span> to raise its benchmark interest rate earlier than the early 2016 date it has indicated, but the disappointing official data mean some have reconsidered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forward contracts tied to sterling money market rates imply a 37% probability of an interest-rate increase by the BOE in November 2014, down from nearly 90% in mid-September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one bright spot, construction of new private housing increased 1.6% on the month in August and 16.7% on an annual basis, indicating the government's intervention in the housing market may be leading to an increase in house building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, the government launched the second stage of its Help to Buy program, which will provide home buyers with a government guarantee for a proportion of their mortgage to an aggregate limit of £12 billion ($19.2 billion).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evidence of more housebuilding will come as a relief to the government, which has faced criticism from economists, housing experts and opposition lawmakers who argue that Help to Buy will fuel demand before there is time to build new homes, leading to a sharp increase in house prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction accounts for just 6.3% of U.K. GDP and has been one the most volatile sectors in recent years and had a bigger impact on Britain's overall economic performance than usual. Output from the sector collapsed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and continued to struggle between 2010 and 2012 as austerity measures led to fewer state-sponsored building projects and private building projects stalled. The sector has turned around this year as house prices picked up and commercial activity increased.</p>

</div><div class="author">Ilona Billington  </div><div>828 words</div><div>10 October 2013</div><div>06:09</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Euro-zone house prices rose slightly in the three months to June, the European statistical agency <span class="companylink">Eurostat</span> said on Thursday, in another indication that the currency area's economy is slowly mending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separate national figures released since June suggest the rise may have continued in recent months, with Dutch and Irish prices rising in July and August. <span class="companylink">Eurostat</span> has only recently begun issuing the euro-zone data on housing prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House prices across the 17-country euro zone were 0.3% higher in the second quarter of this year compared with the first three months, although they were still 2.2% lower than in the second quarter of 2012. The quarterly gain was the first since the second quarter of 2012, when prices rose 0.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House prices in the euro zone are still 5.5% below the peak reached five years ago, according to <span class="companylink">Eurostat</span>. Home prices plummeted in some countries as the impact of the 2008's global financial crisis caused banks to reduce mortgage lending and many people lost their jobs. Now, with the economy emerging from an 18-month-long recession in the second quarter, conditions are beginning to change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The economies which are showing reasonable strength at the moment are beginning to see their housing markets improve," said Professor Michael Ball, housing expert and professor of urban and property economics at Henley Business School at Reading University in the U.K. "There is evidence of economic growth, rising jobs and mortgage availability is quite good, and above all mortgage interest rates remain quite low."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising house prices make homeowners feel wealthier and more willing to spend. They also reduce the risk that banks will suffer losses on their mortgage loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless Mr. Ball advocated caution. "One quarter of rising prices doesn't make a boom, and in real terms prices are still falling in many countries," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Details from <span class="companylink">Eurostat</span> show the second quarter gain was led by a 3.7% quarterly rise in Estonia, a 2.8% gain in Luxembourg and a 2.7% quarterly increase in Ireland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite that rise, property prices in Ireland are still only around half their 2007 peak value, after one of the most devastating crashes recorded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent months a strong increase in Dublin home prices, however, helped house prices rise nationwide, according to figures from the Central Statistics Office, which showed prices countrywide rose 0.9% August, compared with the previous month, the fifth consecutive month of gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House prices in Germany also played a part in the rise reported by <span class="companylink">Eurostat</span>. The statistical agency doesn't provide its own measure of German house prices, instead using an estimate based on <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> statistics which showed house prices in the euro zone's largest economy grew around 1.3% in the second quarter from the first.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is a rate of increase not seen since the first quarter of 2008, according to ECB figures, and up from around a quarterly 1.0% increase in the first quarter of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some euro-zone countries are still seeing house prices fall, but the <span class="companylink">Eurostat</span> data showed that the rate of fall was slowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Spain house prices fell 0.8% in the second quarter compared with the first; this is a marked improvement from the 5.1% quarterly decline recorded for the first quarter of this year compared with the last quarter of 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Spain's property slump, which has left prices around 36% below their 2007 peak, according to government estimates, has had harsh knock-on effects throughout the economy, there are now signs there are signs of a property market recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fotocasa, one of Spain's largest real-estate firms, says that the prices for used homes inched 0.7% higher in July from June, the first monthly increase in over three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the company remains cautious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This appears to indicate that housing price decreases are slowing and that we may be seeing a change of trend," said Beatriz Toribio, head of research at Fotocasa. "But it's too early to tell and we must see how the rest of the year goes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Netherlands, where house prices fell 20% from their peak in 2008, there are also signs of improvement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Eurostat</span> data showed that while house prices were 2.0% down in the second quarter, this was still a smaller drop than the 2.7% fall recorded for the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More timely data from Dutch statistics agency CBS have reported a monthly gains of 1.2% in July and 0.1% in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But yet again, experts say it is too early to talk about a recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We should not become too optimistic," said Ger Hukker, the chairman of NVM, an association of Dutch real-estate brokers.</p>

</div><div class="author">Chao Deng </div><div>877 words</div><div>8 October 2013</div><div>07:13</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors in retail property are piling back into China's biggest cities as slower economic growth makes second- and third-tier centers—once considered a good way to bet on brands' eagerness to expand into new markets—less appealing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retail-property investments in first-tier cities such as Beijing and Shanghai have risen to $9.8 billion so far this year, eclipsing the $8.8 billion for all of 2012, according to <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>. In major regional hubs that the global real-estate services company defines as tier-1.5 cities, such investments have fallen to $2.3 billion from $9.3 billion in all of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Investors' tolerance for risk has gone down amidst more moderate economic growth," said Steven McCord, the Shanghai-based director of China retail properties research at <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>. "Buyers are going back to areas that already have mature retail markets and deep consumer bases."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retail property in major cities has become slightly more affordable because investors don't expect rents to rise as fast as they once did, said Mr. McCord. In Shanghai and Beijing, average investment yields on retail properties—a metric that compares the income from a property to its price—have increased by 0.3 percentage point in the past year, according to <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another attraction of first-tier cities for retail-property investors is continued strong demand from luxury brands. "There are more properties with solid cash flow" in tier-one cities, enabling buyers "to get financing, as banks place large importance on this," said Mr. McCord.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In China's smaller cities, the risk is greater that owners can't find tenants, he said. The cities with the most mall space per consumer are outside of tier one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far this year, the largest investments in Chinese retail properties have been in Shanghai and Beijing. In the biggest retail property sale this year, Singaporean developer <span class="companylink">Keppel Land Ltd</span>. and a co-investor bought Life Hub @ Jinqiao, a shopping complex in Shanghai, for 2.64 billion yuan ($431.5 million) in February. In the second-biggest sale, Chinese property developer Guangyao Dongfang bought Zhongguancun Plaza Shopping Centre in Beijing for 2.2 billion yuan, according to <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The growing affluence and rising income among the Shanghainese will see strong demand for well-located premier retail malls," <span class="companylink">Keppel Land</span> China's president, Ho Cheok Kong, said in an email.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That isn't to say investors are giving up on retail properties in smaller cities. U.S. private-equity firm <span class="companylink">Carlyle Group LP</span>, for instance, bought stakes in a shopping mall in Suzhou and another in Hangzhou in May. The malls, which are near Shanghai, are owned by Chinese developer SZITIC Commercial Property Co, which is considering an initial public offering in Hong Kong. Carlyle didn't respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors' preference for locations where retail sales are known to be strong echoes a rethinking by foreign brands. "A core group of luxury brands that have been in China for many years and have already established a large geographic footprint are now allocating more capital toward improving their stores in major cities," said Sebastian Skiff, executive director for Asia retail at CBRE, a real-estate services firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It takes longer to stabilize sales in new markets, including in many third-tier cities, compared to building on strong performance in established core locations," he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">French brand Louis Vuitton is "focusing on improving [and] upgrading the existing stores instead of opening in new markets," a spokeswoman said. The luxury retailer, which has 47 shops around China, including in Urumqi, a third-tier city in the west, has refurbished two of its stores in Beijing and Shanghai in the past 18 months. It is now renovating its China flagship store in Beijing's China World building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Due to the huge population base and higher income, average per-store sales for luxury goods is much higher in first-tier cities than second-tier cities," said Wu Weiyi, vice president of AlixPartners, a consultancy that has helped to restructure retailers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Key players in luxury retail sectors are realizing that too many stores in second-tier cities have negative impacts on their brand image and profitability," he said. "Covering too many customers with less expensive products will dilute the brand's image and is harmful to its luxury position."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jones Lang expects total investment in Chinese retail properties this year to match last year's 19.9 billion yuan, falling short of 2011's 23 billion yuan high. Investors have spent 13.9 billion yuan on retail properties in the first half of this year, suggesting that they are still fairly confident despite expectations that growth in Chinese retail sales will slow in coming years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors are playing it safe by buying mostly in top locations. "Generally speaking, retail sales growth in many lower-tier cities is faster than tier-one cities…but the largest retail markets still lie in tier-one cities," said Xianfang Ren, a Beijing-based economist with IHS Global Insight.</p>

</div><div class="author">Ilona Billington  </div><div>669 words</div><div>7 October 2013</div><div>15:11</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the <span class="companylink">U.K. government</span> launches the controversial second phase of its mortgage-guarantee program Tuesday, yet another survey indicates that house prices are rising and that demand for dwellings is consistently outstripping supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A monthly survey by the <span class="companylink">Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors</span> released Tuesday showed the balance of surveyors reporting an increase in house prices rose to plus 54 in September, the highest level since June 2002 and up from plus 40 in August. The balance is calculated by subtracting the proportion of surveyors reporting that house prices have fallen from the proportion who said they rose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey comes as the <span class="companylink">U.K. government</span> roles out the second phase of its Help-to-Buy scheme, which will provide home buyers with a government guarantee for a proportion of their mortgage to an aggregate limit of £12 billion ($19.2 billion). The scheme was brought forward by three months, having initially been scheduled for launch in January 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Help-to-Buy is going to make the dream of home ownership a reality for many who would otherwise have been shut out," Prime Minister David Cameron said. "This goes right to the heart of my vision for Britain—a country where everyone who works hard can get on in life."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But housing experts fear that the scheme will fuel demand before there is time to build new homes, and lead to a sharp increase in prices that could lead to problems for borrowers and lenders in coming years, repeating a pattern that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a big concern that the supply of property coming to the market is lagging so far behind demand," said Peter Bolton-King, global residential director of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. "This imbalance is likely to result in further upward pressure in prices over the coming months, particularly in the nation's hot spots."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government has tweaked the scheme to respond to concerns that it may inflate a house-price bubble. Treasury chief George Osborne last month asked the Bank of England to make an annual assessment of the impact of the program, including whether that price cap needs to be lowered, or whether the fees charged to lenders under the program may need to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, parliament's Treasury Select Committee, which is charged with scrutinizing the Treasury and Bank of England, on Tuesday's issued a report saying the government has yet to allay its concerns about the program. The committee called on the Treasury to clarify whether the Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee now has the power to cancel the program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The political pressure to extend the [Help to Buy] scheme could be immense. It is therefore all the more important that the Financial Policy Committee's role be clarified as soon as possible," the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development</span> and the International Monetary have also criticized the program and said that a lack of new house building could push prices up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite those concerns, some view the government's increased presence in the mortgage market as supportive for regions where prices have only begun to edge higher in the last month or so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The London market appears more at risk of a bubble, but in other regions such as Northern Ireland and Scotland, where there have been no sustained pickup in house prices, it seems too early to discuss a house price bubble," said Melanie Bowler, U.K. economist for <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Treasury confirmed that Natwest, <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC</span>, Halifax and <span class="companylink">Bank of Scotland</span> will start offering new Help to Buy mortgages this week, while <span class="companylink">Virgin Money</span> and <span class="companylink">Aldermore Bank</span> will begin lending under the program at the start of next year.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OTTAWA--Canadian building permits fell three times more than expected in August, dragged lower by the biggest plunge in planned non-residential construction since 1989.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The total value of building permits issued by Canadian municipalities fell 21.2% to 6.34 billion Canadian dollars ($6.16 billion), Statistics Canada said Monday. Non-residential permits plummeted 37.9%, the most since September 1989, and residential permits were down 5.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consensus call was for overall permits to drop 7.4%, according to a report from <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Canada</span>. The decline came after a large increase the previous month. July's gain, originally estimated at 20.7%, was revised up to 21.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline in August means the trend for building permits since the beginning of the year is "relatively flat," the statistical agency said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the non-residential sector, commercial building permits plunged 45.8% in August with declines in office buildings, retail and wholesale outlets, retail complexes and recreational facilities. Permits were lower in eight provinces, led by Ontario, Alberta and Quebec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Institutional building permits fell 36.7%, the fourth drop in five months, and were down in seven provinces. Ontario accounted for much of the decline from lower planned construction of hospitals and schools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Permits for industrial buildings were down 1.2% from lower planned construction of factories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the residential sector, permits for multi-family dwellings such as condominiums and apartments fell for the third time in eight months, by Ontario and Quebec. Permits for single-family homes also dropped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's housing market was strong in the summer, defying expectations for a slowdown after the <span class="companylink">Canadian government</span> tightened mortgage insurance rules last year for the fourth time since 2008 to cool the market and rein in household debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said last month that he doesn't foresee a housing bubble, and that developments in the market are consistent with a "soft landing." Last week, the Bank's number two official, Senior Deputy Governor Tiff Macklem, said there is a "more constructive evolution of household imbalances, referring to housing and household debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, municipalities approved construction of 17,471 new residences in August, a 0.7% drop from the prior month, with single-family homes down 3.4% but multi-family dwellings up 0.8%.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Daniel Lippman   </div><div>887 words</div><div>7 October 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>R12</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed's planned "taper" has been tough on real-estate mutual funds and exchange-traded funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After generally rising strongly over the past few years, the funds have fallen an average of about 12% since late May, when the Federal Reserve signaled it might soon scale back its bond-buying program and interest rates started to climb. (Although the Fed surprised the market in September by maintaining its monthly bond purchases, most see the move as only temporary.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some professionals say that even though rising interest rates are negative for real-estate funds in the short term, investors shouldn't give up on the group yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If rates are rising because the economy is improving, it's generally going to be positive for earnings growth" at real-estate businesses, says Paul Morgan, managing director at investment bank <span class="companylink">MLV &amp; Co</span>. Moreover, analysts say, when interest rates started to rise in 2004, real-estate securities and funds rebounded after an initial hiccup.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At many real-estate funds and ETFs, the primary holdings are equity real-estate investment trusts, which are public companies that own properties such as office buildings, warehouses and shopping centers and make their money mostly in rents. REIT-heavy funds tend to be income-oriented because REITs have to pay out 90% of their taxable income in dividends to retain REIT status. The average dividend yield on equity REITs was 3.83% as of Sept. 30, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The funds have suffered this year because rising rates make it costlier for REITs to borrow money for new developments or acquisitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some investors also have used REITs and REIT-heavy funds as alternatives to bond investments. With their big dividends, REITs "have had a lot of capital inflow just because of the interest in yield," says David Toti, REIT analyst at <span class="companylink">Cantor Fitzgerald</span>. But when interest rates rise, that pushes down the prices of older, lower-yielding bonds -- and can put similar price pressure on REITs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the first five months of 2013, investors pumped more than $10 billion of net new cash into real-estate funds and ETFs, according to research firm <span class="companylink">Morningstar Inc</span>. Then in June, July and August, nearly $3.5 billion flowed out of these funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mitch Roschelle, leader of the U.S. real-estate advisory practice at <span class="companylink">PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC</span>, says that these funds are "very sensitive" to investor behavior and that "when investors run for the hills and sell, prices fall . . . and that's exactly what investors did."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in fleeing these funds and REITs, investors may have lost sight of the big picture: The reason the Fed may wind down its bond-buying program is because the economy is slowly, but steadily, growing, which will ultimately help businesses that own real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, "in many markets, there's not a mismatch between supply and demand," says Marc Halle, manager of the Prudential Global Real Estate Fund, up 4% this year through September. "As the economy gets better and we add more jobs, you can't produce more supply overnight. . .[so] we'll start to see landlords have pricing power." Higher retail sales and increased business confidence might push up demand and prices for many types of real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Roschelle says that while the correction since May has made it "a tremendous buying opportunity" for investors with long-term horizons, it will take some time for cash flow at REITs to improve substantially because of higher rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For investors who are less interested in income, Colleen Chandler of investment-management firm VennWell LLC likes (and has clients currently invested in) Baron Real Estate, which focuses on growth and has holdings in land development, senior living, hotels, and data centers. The fund is up 16% this year through September. It has held up well because most of its holdings are in non-REIT real-estate-related companies that are less at risk from interest-rate spikes. Only 10 to 13% of its assets are in REITs and it has a 1% yield, according to Baron. Ms. Chandler has used REIT funds in the past but says a growth-oriented real-estate approach is more appropriate in this investment environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brenda Wenning of Wenning Investments LLC in Newton, Mass., moved her clients out of real-estate funds in late May. She says she'll buy again once interest rates start to stabilize. She likes funds from manager <span class="companylink">Cohen &amp; Steers Inc</span>. for U.S. real estate, as well as Fidelity International Real Estate fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One big question mark is how much interest rates will move up and how swiftly. "The worst-case scenario is if we have a situation where rates go up very quickly, much faster than anybody anticipated," says Mr. Toti. That would raise REITs' cost of capital, reduce the profitability of new developments and acquisitions, and hurt real-estate demand.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vince Camuto, co-founder of retail brand Nine West, and his wife, Louise, have put their 20,000-square-foot home in Water Mill, N.Y., on the market for $49.5 million, according to their agent Tim Davis of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Called Villa Maria, the 11-bedroom, 12-bathroom estate was built in 1887 and sits on 7.6 acres on Mecox Bay. It has a triple-story spiraling staircase, a 1,682-square-foot grand salon with a floor-to-ceiling fireplace and a library with a domed atrium. A solarium connects a family room with heated limestone floors to an adjacent carriage house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Upstairs, a 2,700-square-foot master suite takes up the west wing. At the opposite end are five bedroom suites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the third floor, there's a barrel-vaulted playroom that leads to a terrace that overlooks the bay. A spa is also on that floor, as well as a gym that opens out onto another roof terrace overlooking the water. In addition, there's a media loft with a fireplace and cathedral ceiling. Outside, there's a 68-foot-long pool, a tennis court and a guesthouse with two bedrooms and three bathrooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Camuto and his wife, who together run women's fashion company the Camuto Group, bought the home in 2005 for $35 million from the Sisters of the Order of St. Dominic of Amityville. They had owned the property since 1931. The Camutos then spent five years rebuilding the home, from the studs up, with architect Andre Tchelistcheff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An additional adjacent 8 acres are available for an undisclosed price, according to Mr. Davis. Mr. Davis adds that the Camutos are selling because they are about to embark on another similar project in the Hamptons. "We love transforming iconic properties, although this was certainly not a speculative project," said the Camutos in a statement. "Another opportunity has become available on a slightly smaller scale which we are very excited about."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to Mr. Davis, Peter Huffine, also of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, has the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Restaurateur Jeffrey Chodorow has sold his 3,700-square-foot Manhattan condominium in Trump Tower for $16.5 million, one of the highest recorded sale prices in the building's 30-year-history, according to Mr. Chodorow's broker Oren Alexander. The buyer purchased the property under a limited-liability corporation called Legal 1031 Holdings 1787R.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Chodorow, whose group of restaurants includes Red Farm and China Grill, created the three-bedroom, six-bathroom unit by combining three separate apartments into one. He spent $5.4 million on those apartments in 2004 and took three years to combine and redo them, turning 10 rooms into seven.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The modern, corner space is on the 38th floor and has floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the Empire State Building and Central Park. The master bedroom is connected to a white marble bathroom with heated floors and room-sized closets. Two of the bedrooms are in a wing with a kitchenette that can be accessed separately.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Chodorow initially put the seven-room apartment on the market in April 2011 for $16.4 million with a different broker. He then raised the price to $18.8 million in 2012 but later lowered it to $17.5 million in 2013. Mr. Alexander says Mr. Chodorow wanted to sell because he and his family are spending the majority of their time traveling and in Miami, and he is now an empty nester. Mr. Chodorow didn't return a request for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rana Williams of <span class="companylink">Keller Williams Realty</span> represented the buyer. Mr. Alexander and Tal Alexander of the Alexander Team at <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> represented Mr. Chodorow in the transaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate investor and developer Richard Papalian has put an 11,000-square-foot home in Beverly Hills on the market for $36 million, according to his agent Mauricio Umansky, co-founder and chief executive of the Agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Papalian, 58, said he bought the home in 2006, tore it down and spent four years building a new home on the property in a modern style. The home comes fully furnished, down to the bathroom towels. Mr. Papalian built it as a spec home. "I built the house to take advantage of what I thought was an extraordinary lot in Beverly Hills," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home sits up on a promontory in the hills on nearly an acre north of Sunset Boulevard. The home has six bedrooms and 10 bathrooms and floor-to-ceiling windows with views of the city, from downtown Los Angeles to the coastline and the ocean. The kitchen has lacquered Italian cabinetry, <span class="companylink">Miele</span> appliances and a separate beverage bar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A master suite has a fireplace that sits in a white glass wall and a wet bar. There's also a 2,200-square-foot private deck with a fire feature and a six-person Jacuzzi hot tub. There is a home theater with seating for 11 people on the home's lower level. On that same level, there's a 1,000-bottle wine room that is visible from the glass floor above. There is also an all-glass six-car garage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside, there's an infinity pool and another Jacuzzi. A guesthouse on the property has a gym as well as a bedroom, living room and built-in kitchenette. A balcony off the guesthouse has a fire pit and views of the city and the ocean. </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SYDNEY—Samantha Walton and her fiancé Simon Cleary feel their dream of buying an apartment in Sydney's trendy eastern suburbs is slipping out of reach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They have secure jobs and live with Ms. Walton's parents, an arrangement that has helped them save money for a deposit over the past year. Their ambitions are modest: a one-bedroom property worth 500,000 Australian dollars (US$470,000), well below the average for a new Australian home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But house prices are on the move—spooking first-time home buyers and worrying central bankers, who fear record-low interest rates and looser mortgage lending are boosting property speculation, which could potentially derail a fragile economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Mr. Cleary and Ms. Walton, what had been a five-year plan to get to the first rung on the property ladder looks like it could take up to a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't think in five years we'll be paying A$500,000 for a one-bedroom apartment," said Mr. Cleary, a 23-year-old information-technology support worker. "I think it will be a lot more than that. With houses so expensive, and they're only going up in price, it makes us a bit wary of actually purchasing a house."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They aren't alone. The strong rebound in home values this year—particularly in cosmopolitan cities like Sydney—has made saving enough for a deposit harder for the average Australian working couple. And it may get tougher as low interest rates spur monthly gains in mortgage lending that threaten to put the housing market out of step with the rest of the economy as it nears the end of a long mining boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Australian house prices jumped more than 5% in the second quarter from a year earlier, the fastest pace in three years, while auction-clearance rates and home-loan approvals have risen steadily. Data this week showed capital-city house prices climbed to a record high, led by properties in Sydney and Melbourne.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors are betting that rising home values will outpace other asset classes in Australia and overseas. New lending to investors surged by almost 26% in July from a year earlier, the steepest gain in six years, according to government data. In contrast, loans to owner-occupiers increased at half that rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Chris Fellas, a Sydney-based financial adviser, that has set off alarm bells. The 42-year-old recently sold a house in the leafy inner-city suburb of Paddington for around A$2.5 million, but plans to stay out of buying property for at least the next few months. "I think the market is quite hot," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span> has urged governments to prevent house prices from rising too steeply, recalling the experience of 2008, when reckless lending helped to trigger the global financial crisis. Australian house prices last spurred a sharp increase in borrowing that gave the central bank pause in 2003, when it raised rates to avert a banking crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central bank last week warned the nation's lenders against offering mortgages too freely, citing the risk of a dangerous surge in speculative home buying. It said excessive speculation posed a threat if house prices were to suddenly drop sharply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has lowered interest rates eight times in two years, hoping to spur other parts of the resource-dominated economy and contain swelling unemployment as mining firms cut jobs. At its last policy meeting in early September, it kept interest rates at 2.5% and didn't rule out further reductions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it faces a dilemma. While the low rates are needed to cushion the economy from the resource slowdown, and despite home buyers stimulating sectors like construction, retail and manufacturing, the bank doesn't dare let prices rise unchecked. A housing crash would rapidly undo what little progress has been made reigniting the rest of the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It would be difficult to nip a house-price boom in the bud when the economy is weak and jobs are being lost," said Michael Blythe, Sydney-based chief economist at <span class="companylink">Commonwealth Bank of Australia</span>, one of the country's biggest mortgage lenders. "It could be a nasty choice one way or the other."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low interest rates have had a modest impact on other industries. Reports this week showed retail sales rose by more than economists expected, and manufacturing expanded for the first time in more than two years following sharp falls in the Australian dollar. Consumer and business confidence has also risen since last month's election of a new conservative government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some economists are looking for more evidence that a broad-based recovery is under way given that retail sales grew at their weakest pace in half a century in the year through June and manufacturing has only just expanded after 26 months in contraction. In the second quarter, the economy grew by 2.6% from a year earlier, compared with quarterly expansion rates as high as 4% in early 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing story is much more compelling. RP Data-Rismark's property gauge, which tracks median house prices across the nation's major cities, rose 1.6% on month and 5.5% on year in September—to a record high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is activity far beyond what we have seen in more recent times," said Scott Kennedy-Green, McGrath Estate Agents' chief auctioneer for the last 16 years, based in Sydney.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, government figures show the number of mortgages approved by lenders has risen each month so far this year. Along with retail, housing is among the most rate-sensitive sectors, and recoveries in both have led previous expansions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A sustained period of below-average interest rates could increase speculative activity in the housing market and encourage marginal borrowers to increase debt," the central bank said last month. Its remarks, and a briefing it had on New Zealand's central bank, which faces similar pressures, reinvigorated the debate over whether there is now a risk of a bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Warwick McKibbin, a professor of economics at <span class="companylink">Australian National University</span> and a member of the central bank's board until two years ago, said it is possible. Strongly rising house prices against the backdrop of a slowing economy spells danger, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You might think houses prices are higher than fundamental value, which is a bubble, but it's hard to see it until it bursts," he said. "If a shock comes from overseas, you don't want to be in a situation where a whole bunch of bubbles start to burst."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For others, the continuing house-price surge is nothing to be too alarmed about, and may even be necessary to allow other sectors to take up the slack from the mining slowdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are a lot of people in Australia that believe housing either booms or collapses and does nothing in between," said Adam Boyton, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> in Sydney. "I think the reality is we have a recovery in housing and that's essential in getting a rebalancing in the economy."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When superstorm Sandy hit parts of New Jersey, it sparked concerns about future investor demand for commercial real estate in the waterlogged region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly a year later, only some of those fears have materialized. Sales growth for office, retail and apartment properties overall in New Jersey has slowed somewhat, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, a real-estate research firm. But in Northern New Jersey, which includes areas less affected by the storm, sales of industrial properties are on pace to hit a record high this year, according to real-estate firm Cushman &amp; Wakefield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total sales volume of industrial properties 100,000 square feet or larger hit $1.02 billion as of the middle of September, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield. That is a 64% increase from $623 million in all of 2012, and surpasses the previous record of $922 million in northern New Jersey industrial transactions in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Northern New Jersey also is outperforming the national industrial market. Nationwide, the volume of industrial sales valued at $2.5 million or higher are on pace to hit about $37 billion this year. That is still shy of the annual peak of $60.8 million set in 2007, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Everyone wants to know if Sandy impacted buildings but at the end of the day there's still a need to be close to [New York City]," said Kyle Schmidt, a broker who specializes in industrial sales with Cushman &amp; Wakefield. Mr. Schmidt said that while investors prefer buildings outside of flood plains, when necessary they are willing to pay the higher insurance premiums to have access to one of the nation's biggest industrial markets. Even properties in the Meadowlands, a marshy area prone to flooding, are prized by many investors because of the area's proximity to Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the most noteworthy deals is the recent sale of a 887,000-square-foot warehouse in Cranbury, N.J., about 45 miles southwest of New York City, purchased for $98 million by the <span class="companylink">California Public Employees' Retirement System</span>. The property fetched 20% more than what Exeter Property Group paid two years ago, and it was one of the largest single-property warehouse deals in the region since the financial crisis. Calpers, the giant pension fund, declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, the flurry of deals in northern New Jersey is partly fueled by a rising pack of large institutional investors that are bulking up on warehouses. <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span> has made a series of large acquisitions since the downturn to become one of the largest U.S. owners of warehouses and distribution centers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently, <span class="companylink">Brookfield Asset Management</span> has agreed to acquire <span class="companylink">Industrial Developments International Inc</span>. Calpers is expected to invest several billion dollars in the next three to five years on industrial properties, according to Martin Standiford, a senior vice president of acquisitions with adviser Bentall Kennedy. The firm represented Calpers in the purchase of the Cranbury property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the deal flow recovering faster than some areas' rents and occupancies, analysts and investors are on the lookout for overheating. Exeter Property Group, which sold the Cranbury building, say it would cheer rising prices because its strategy is to buy properties in need of improvement and then sell. "A run up in prices is good for us on the exit," said Ward Fitzgerald, Exeter's chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While industrial properties are among the least glamorous sectors in commercial real estate, the returns tend to be higher than what office buildings or apartments offer. Some analysts say the improving economy means a greater need for warehouse space for consumer goods and housing-construction materials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Northern New Jersey is one of Calpers' target markets, according to Mr. Standiford. He said the property's long-term tenant along with its unusually high ceilings and solar panels made it an attractive investment. In addition, it isn't in the flood plain and the building wasn't affected by Sandy. "That's the acid test," Mr. Standiford said. Hopefully you only have one of those storms every 20 years or so."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The net worth of U.S. families and nonprofit organizations rose 1.8% to $74.82 trillion in the second quarter as rising home values and stock-market gains boosted balance sheets, the Federal Reserve reported Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That put household net worth—the value of homes, stocks and other investments minus debts and other liabilities—at its highest level since records began in 1945, not adjusting for inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed's quarterly "Financial Accounts of the United States" report provides the latest evidence that Americans are gradually rebuilding their wealth after the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices of new homes, which have risen at double-digit rates in the past year, are starting to level out, the latest evidence that builders are backing away from aggressive increases as mortgage rates rise and buyers have second thoughts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the nation's biggest home builders have pushed through price increases as high as 20% in some parts of the country this year, driven by strong demand. But the combination of rising mortgage rates and rising prices is starting to give some buyers pause, prompting builders to rethink their pricing strategyContracts for sales of new homes remained relatively brisk in August, rising 7.9% from July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 421,000 units, according to data released Wednesday by the <span class="companylink">U.S. Census Bureau</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contracts had tumbled in July. But the average sale price registered $318,900 in August, little changed from July's $318,500 and up 4.4% from August 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The annual rush to add seasonal workers this holiday looks to present a mixed picture. <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart Stores</span> said it plans to add 55,000 seasonal workers this holiday, 10% more than last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Kohl's</span> said it plans to increase hiring this holiday "slightly" to "well above" 50,000, with the biggest increase in its distribution centers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast, Target has said its holiday hiring will decline about 20% to 70,000. It said the change came as its year-round employees request to work more hours, with the company planning to give them as much as 5% to 10% more hours for the busiest periods around Black Friday and the week before Christmas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. officials disclosed insurance prices that will be offered through new federally run health-care exchanges starting Oct. 1, showing that young, healthy buyers likely will pay more than they do currently while older, sicker consumers should get a break.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Costs will vary widely from state to state and for different types of consumers. Across the country, the initial average premium for a 27-year-old nonsmoker, regardless of gender, will be $163 a month for the "bronze" plan; $203 for the more comprehensive "silver" plan; and $240 for the "gold" plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department's latest revision of second-quarter GDP numbers left growth for the quarter unchanged at 2.5%, but disclosed good news for third-quarter growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growth came more from final sales and less from inventory building. As a result, any increase in demand this quarter is being met mostly by increased output.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Treasury Department warned that the federal government would have just $30 billion in cash "no later" than Oct. 17.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Congressional Budget Office</span> said this would be exhausted by Oct. 31 if Congress doesn't raise the debt ceiling. </p>

</div><div class="author">Nicholas Winning  </div><div>762 words</div><div>27 September 2013</div><div>02:01</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON—U.K. Treasury chief George Osborne has asked the <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span> to make an annual assessment of the impact of his government's flagship housing policy on the property market, amid concern the initiative risks stoking a boom in prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.K. Treasury said Friday the central bank's Financial Policy Committee, which safeguards financial stability, will report to the chancellor each September on how the Help-to-Buy program is operating and whether it needs to be changed. The first report will be next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The program offers would-be home buyers taxpayer-funded loans to make down payments, and from next year buyers will be able to take advantage of government loan guarantees to get bigger mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Help-to-Buy loans are available only for homes worth up to £600,000 pounds ($962,460). Part of the FPC's role will be to determine whether that price cap needs to be lowered, or whether the fees charged to lenders under the program may need to rise, a treasury spokesman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The committee will also decide in three years whether the program should be scrapped altogether, a responsibility it has had since the initiative was first announced in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We welcome the opportunity to for the FPC to assess each year the effect of the Help-to-Buy scheme on the sustainable evolution of the housing market," a BOE spokesman said Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Help-to-Buy program is the flagship policy in a range of measures aimed at revitalizing a long-subdued housing market in the U.K. A central bank facility that offers banks cheap funding to make more loans has already helped fuel extra mortgage lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics of the government's policies—including economists, lawmakers and business minister Vince Cable—warn that without greater supply the programs will only inflate a bubble in prices and lock poor and first-time buyers out of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Tumbling mortgage interest rates, falling uncertainty and rising optimism are already driving a sharp upturn in the housing market. Adding a subsidy to an already improving market is not a risk worth taking," said Rob Wood, chief U.K. economist at <span class="companylink">Berenberg Bank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The opposition Labour Party has accused Prime Minister David Cameron's government of trying to engineer a rise in house prices for political gain ahead of the next general election in 2015. On Friday it said the central bank should review the second phase of Help to Buy immediately and slammed Mr. Osborne for failing to address the fundamental problem of low levels of home construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Rising demand for housing must be matched with rising supply. Unless George Osborne acts now to build more affordable homes, as Labour has urged, then he risks making it even harder for first time buyers to get on the housing ladder," Ed Balls, Labour treasury spokesman, said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Treasury spokesman didn't immediately respond to requests for additional comment Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are signs Britain's housing market is already taking off. Mortgage lender <span class="companylink">Nationwide Building Society</span> said Friday house prices in the U.K. rose 0.9% in September from August and were 5.0% higher compared with a year earlier, the fastest pace of annual growth in prices in more than three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in prices is even more acute in London and the prosperous southeast of England. Average prices in London were 10% higher in September than a year earlier and are now 8% higher than their prerecession peak, <span class="companylink">Nationwide</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government ministers say they are alert to the risks but argue the programs are needed because activity in the housing market—an important driver of consumer confidence and spending in Britain—remains subdued. Prices in most parts of the country remain well below their prerecession highs and the number of transactions in the market are low compared with previous years, they say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Help-to-Buy is the right thing to be doing," Danny Alexander, Mr. Osborne's No. 2 at the treasury, told The Wall Street Journal earlier this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FPC said on Wednesday officials discussed the housing market at their regular quarterly meeting and concluded that while a recovery is gaining momentum, activity is still well below past norms. The panel said it intends to be "vigilant to potential emerging vulnerabilities."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Continue Their Slide</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of Americans signing contracts to buy previously owned homes fell in August for the third consecutive month, more evidence that higher mortgage rates are restraining the real-estate recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Thursday its seasonally adjusted index for pending sales of existing homes fell 1.6% from a month earlier to a reading of 107.7 in August.

</div><div class="author">Esther Fung </div><div>769 words</div><div>26 September 2013</div><div>15:42</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHANGHAI—Tighter credit and falling housing prices in the eastern Chinese city of Wenzhou have led to a wave of mortgage defaults and abandoned properties in the city, where persistent property-price drops have flown in the face of a national upturn in prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners in the city have abandoned 580 homes and there are another 15 cases of mortgages in default, according to a national state-radio broadcast citing a local official in charge of investigating mortgage defaults. The broadcast, which followed local-media reports of more widespread defaults, didn't give a timeframe for the cases cited, and the official numbers are hardly staggering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the trend is noteworthy because Chinese property buyers have typically preferred to hang on to their investments rather than surrender to a sinking market. Credit problems are the key reason behind the rising number of buyers who walk away from their purchases, the official said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speculation had helped drive up Chinese property prices, prompting a government clampdown that briefly brought some price stability, but prices in most Chinese cities have been climbing this year. Last month, new-home prices in 70 Chinese cities rose at their fastest pace since January 2011, according to official data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wenzhou, known as the birthplace of Chinese entrepreneurship, is an outlier. Known for abundant lending fueled by trust-based financing networks, much of it without collateral, the city has posted year-on-year declines in housing prices every month since August 2011. It was the only city among the 70 included in the official price survey to do so, though private-sector data tracker China Real Estate Index System, has seen price drops in Haikou and Sanya, both on the resort island of Hainan, where speculation was also rife prior to the property-tightening campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wenzhou, which had built export industries around cigarette lighters, buttons and zippers, has been hit extra hard by the slowdown in China's export sector and controls on informal financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The loose credit environment in the previous years caused many people in Wenzhou to be excessively leveraged. The party is over and some people are being forced to sell off their assets," said Johnson Hu, an analyst at CIMB Securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At its peak, average home prices in the city were almost at par with first-tier cities like Beijing and Shanghai and 160% above second-tier cities, according to brokerage CLSA. Prices in Wenzhou started to correct in 2012 as a result of a liquidity crunch and government curbs on multiple home purchases, while resilient demand in major Chinese cities kept prices relatively firm there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price drops in Wenzhou have moderated recently. According to data from Creis, the private-sector data tracker, prices for new homes in Wenzhou last month fell by 10.2% year on year, compared with a 21.7% fall recorded in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price declines in Wenzhou have meant that many of those who borrowed heavily to make purchases mainly for investment now owe more on their mortgages than the homes are worth, making them more inclined to give up their property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were 2,584 nonperforming loans out of 210,000 existing mortgages in Wenzhou, "so the risk isn't big." the radio report said, citing the official. At the end of July, mortgage loans in the city totaled 247.7 billion yuan ($40.5 billion), while nonperforming loans totaled 5.29 billion yuan, making the nonperforming-loan ratio a still manageable 2.13%, the report added. A total of 3.85% of all loans in Wenzhou, including mortgages and other borrowings, are nonperforming, it said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokeswoman at the Wenzhou branch of the <span class="companylink">China Banking Regulatory Commission</span> declined to answer questions and directed queries to the broadcast for details.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, Wenzhou was allowed to ease restrictions on purchases of second homes, amid concerns over slowing economic growth, while most other cities had to keep existing curbs in place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wenzhou, in coastal Zhejiang province, said at the time that the restriction was lifted because prices had been kept at reasonable levels since the second half of last year, and that the property sector still has a role in driving the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beijing has maintained property-market controls for nearly four years in a bid to keep prices from spiraling higher and triggering social unrest. For home buyers, curbs include limits on credit and higher down-payment requirements. For developers, they include restrictions on stock and bond offerings and on bank borrowing.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—The number of Americans signing contracts to buy previously owned homes fell in August for the third consecutive month, more evidence that higher mortgage rates are restraining the housing-market recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But new filings for unemployment benefits dropped to a six-year low last week, offering hope that the labor market is withstanding turbulence from volatile interest rates and uncertainty from Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> on Thursday said its seasonally adjusted index for pending sales of existing homes fell 1.6% from a month earlier to a reading of 107.7 in August. An index of 100 roughly coincides with annual existing-home sales around 5.3 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending home sales offer a timely reading on the market because they are tallied when a contract is signed rather than at the closing, as with some other indicators. Sales are usually finalized one or two months after the signing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales spiked earlier this year as Americans rushed to close deals when rates were even lower. Mortgage rates started climbing in May, when the Federal Reserve signaled it could start to wind down its $85 billion-a-month bond purchase program. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose more than a percentage point to as high as 4.58%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed officials last week decided to stand pat on the bond-buying program while they assessed the fallout from rising rates. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage dropped to 4.32% following the Fed's decision, a nine-week low, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing, along with consumer spending, has been an important driver of economic growth this year. Higher home prices tend to boost confidence and make Americans feel wealthier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A healthier labor market also would help sentiment in American households.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest drop in the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits points to a sharp improvement in the jobs picture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs, decreased by 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 305,000 in the week ended Sept. 21, the Labor Department said Thursday. That pushed the four-week moving average of claims down to the lowest level since June 2007, though recent data irregularities in some states cast doubt on the reliability of the figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next week's employment report should offer a clearer picture of the jobs market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing market may be starting to feel the effects of the higher rates during the summer but that may be countered by improving labor market conditions," said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Labor-market indicators have been mixed this year. The unemployment rate drifted to 7.3% in August from 7.9% at the start of the year, though the pace of job creation has been unimpressive amid slow economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. economy expanded at a 2.5% pace in the second quarter after its 1.1% gain in the first quarter, the Commerce Department said Thursday. The figures for gross domestic product, the broadest measure of all goods and services produced in the economy, showed the economy expanding at a modest rate ahead of potential turbulence this fall from uncertainty about government policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economic growth in the current quarter already looks weaker, with forecasts indicating a growth pace of 2% or less.</p>

</div><div class="author">Eamon Quinn  </div><div>715 words</div><div>26 September 2013</div><div>04:59</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DUBLIN—Irish home prices rose for the fifth consecutive month in August, again led by a strong rise in the capital, evidence that the country is beginning to emerge from the property crash that sent its economy into a tailspin and wrecked its banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ireland's government and its international bailout creditors watch home prices for signs that the economy is recovering from its banking and fiscal crisis. The banks need the property market to recover very strongly to help stem losses they suffered on their loan books after house prices collapsed more than five years ago and sent the country to the brink of bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scars of the country's long property slump remain deep. Home prices countrywide are still 49% below their 2007 peak, marking one of the largest declines recorded world-wide, and it will likely be many years before they ever again match such levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Central Statistics Office data published Thursday shows prices are at last stabilizing and starting a "slow recovery," said David Duffy, a housing expert at the <span class="companylink">Economic and Social Research Institute</span>, Ireland's leading think tank. He predicts that prices will rise 5% countrywide in 2013, the first such annual rise since the crash began, led by large gains in Dublin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices rose 0.9% in August, following increases of 1.2% in July, 1.2% in June, 0.3% in May and 0.8% in April, the CSO said, and were 2.8% higher than in August 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Dublin, residential prices rose by 1.9% in August, and were 10.6% higher than a year earlier, marking the largest annual increase since April 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices outside the capital rose in August by only 0.1% on the month, showing evidence of a clear urban/rural divide, and a very uneven housing-market recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is no doubt that lack of supply has driven Dublin house prices up," said Alan McQuaid, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Merrion Capital</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash buyers are also driving price rises in the capital, which isn't a sign of a healthy housing market because there are only so many people who can pay cash for property, analysts warn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Simon Ensor, chairman of real-estate agency Sherry FitzGerald Residential, estimates that half of the Dublin transactions are cash deals, led by expatriate Irish investors who are returning home after doing well in the U.S. and U.K.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But the stock of houses for sale in Dublin is less than 1%, which is well below the 3% level of transactions that would characterize a healthy market," Mr. Ensor said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A strong and sustained recovery in home prices will require a return to a sound market for home loans, but banking industry figures don't yet suggest that is under way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many households continue to grapple with large debts and few economists expect a very strong recovery in residential prices. The Irish government is preparing to detail next month tax increases and spending cuts in its budget for 2014, which will mark the country's sixth year of austerity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unemployment, though down from its peak, is at 13.4%, and emigration remains at elevated levels. Ireland's economy expanded in the three months to June by 0.4% from the first quarter, but was still 1.2% lower than a year earlier, the CSO said last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, the evidence of rising house price rises should come as a relief to the coalition government as a sign that the wider economy is starting to recover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the final years of the housing boom, 2006 and 2007, prices rose 14.7% and 7.3% respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the bubble burst, Irish home prices fell by an annual 7% in 2008, and then plunged 18.8% in 2009 and 12.4% in 2010. Prices also posted double-digit declines in 2011 and 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With prices for commercial property also slumping, Irish banks were left with huge losses, and required huge sums from Irish taxpayers to rescue them from collapse. Ireland eventually was forced to strike an international bailout deal in late 2010.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Ben Casselman   </div><div>865 words</div><div>26 September 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans' household finances have made up most of the ground lost in the recession, but rising interest rates and renewed turmoil in Washington are threatening to short-circuit that recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rebounding home prices and a rising stock market helped boost household wealth by more than $1.3 trillion in the second quarter of this year, Federal Reserve data showed Wednesday. The gain marked the seventh consecutive quarterly increase and pushed household net worth -- the value of homes, stocks and other assets minus debts and other liabilities -- to $74.8 trillion, an all-time high. Adjusting for inflation, net worth is about 4% below its peak, meaning households have made back about 80% of what they lost during the bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data echo other recent signs that households are emerging from their prolonged postcrisis slump. After years of deleveraging -- both voluntarily, through paying down debts, and involuntarily, through foreclosures and bankruptcies -- the share of Americans' paychecks that goes to debt payments stands near a 30-year low. That has given households more money to spend on everything from cars to vacations: Average consumer spending surpassed its prerecession high in 2012, before adjusting for inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That recovery has been a key driver of economic growth during a period of government cutbacks and lackluster business investment. Economic output would actually have contracted in both late 2012 and early 2013 if it hadn't been for solid gains in consumer spending. Many economists expect the government to revise upward its estimate of second-quarter spending growth when new figures are released Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is unclear whether that momentum can continue. Job growth remains weak and may even have slowed modestly over the summer; many economists expect next week's monthly employment report to show little if any acceleration in hiring in September. Income gains have been muted and concentrated among wealthier Americans. Income for the typical household was flat in 2012, after adjusting for inflation, and remains well below precrisis highs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Reserve policy makers have hinted that the uncertain consumer outlook is one reason for their decision last week to leave unchanged their $85 billion-a-month bond-buying program. "The drivers of consumer spending do not look particularly supportive," New York Fed President William Dudley said in a speech Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another wild card: Washington, where the latest budget battle is threatening to lead to a government shutdown next week and a fight over raising the congressionally mandated borrowing limit could roil financial markets. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke cited the issues as another reason for last week's decision to keep stimulus efforts in place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One key factor offsetting both weak income growth and Washington turmoil has been the rebound in the housing market. Home prices rose at their fastest pace in more than seven years in July, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller index, and new-home sales rebounded in August after dropping sharply in July. Rising real-estate values accounted for nearly half of the gains in household wealth in the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Linda Miner, a real-estate agent in Vail, Colo., said home sales were strong this summer, especially at the high and low end of the market. But she said that with prices still down from before the housing bust, sellers aren't experiencing the windfalls that might once have led them to spend big on renovations or furnishings when they moved into a new home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joe Blair and his wife sold their Vail-area home last fall for about $30,000 less than they'd paid for it in 2005. After several months of searching, they paid about $600,000 for a new home in the area in July. Despite trading up to a larger home to accommodate their three young children, the Blairs held on to their old furniture. Their one splurge, Mr. Blair said, was on new patio furniture he found at <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> for 60% off. If not for the sale, Mr. Blair said, "we'd be hitting the garage sales."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists fear the recent spike in interest rates could slow the housing rebound. Mortgage rates are up nearly a full percentage point since May, and were even higher before the Fed's bond-buying announcement last week. Rising rates, combined with higher prices, are making homes less affordable: The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>' housing affordability index is down more than 25% since January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising rates haven't yet dented prices, although many economists expect that to change as August data become available. But higher rates are already bringing an end to the three-year refinancing boom that has helped millions of borrowers free up cash for other uses. The mortgage company <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> estimates that borrowers who refinanced in the second quarter will save more than $6 billion in interest over the next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a real shot in the arm in terms of supporting both consumer spending and investment spending," Freddie Mac chief economist Frank Nothaft said. "We'll see a lot less refinancing going forward."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">River House, a 1930s co-op apartment tower on the East River, wants to turn its private club into New York's largest and most expensive home, a 62,000-square-foot residence with a price of $130 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The five-story club space, with a private entrance on East 52nd Street and a riverfront garden, has enough room for about 10 typical Manhattan townhouses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If sold at anything close to the asking price, the home -- at just under $2,100 a square foot -- would rate as a bargain, at least compared with recent penthouse sales that have hovered at $10,000 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For the right person, this is a trophy of all trophies, "said Kirk Henckels, director of private brokerage at <span class="companylink">Stribling &amp; Associates</span>, who isn't involved in the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers noted that prices in east Midtown long have lagged behind those on the Upper East Side or in new downtown condos, with an especially deep discount for larger trophy properties. The most expensive sale at River House has been $11.65 million, city records show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The co-op board at River House decided to put the space on the market after it failed to agree on a long-term lease renewal or sale of the space to the private club, the River Club of New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The not-for-profit group has leased the space at River House since the 26-story Art Deco tower opened in 1931.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The club has two tennis courts, a swimming pool, a squash court and a card room. It once opened onto a private dock on the East River, before the FDR Drive was built. River House has had many prominent residents, including Henry Kissinger and novelist Barbara Taylor Bradford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charles G. Berry, a lawyer and president of the board of managers at the River Club, said the 900-member club was "still very much in discussions with River House" because there was a "broad recognition that the club adds significant value" to the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Allison, the chairman of the River House board and an investment manager, said the board was open to continued talks with the River Club, but that in the meantime it decided to consider alternatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Allison and a majority of co-op owners at River House are members of the club. But he said that plans have been drawn up to create a pool, a gym and recreation space within the co-op's existing space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The co-op board brought in Georgetown Co., a privately held real-estate group, as a development adviser to explore options for the space. It concluded that conversion to a single-family home, or an ambassadorial residence and mission, made the most sense, said Adam Flatto, Georgetown's president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the co-op board plans to deliver the residence as raw space, the listing for the space by Brown Harris Steven shows it reimagined it as a single-family home by New York designer Tony Ingrao. In images of Mr. Ingrao's vision, a low-ceilinged warren of guest rooms would be ripped out so a library and other rooms one floor below could have double-height ceilings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most expensive closed sale to date in New York is $88 million for a penthouse at 15 Central Park West owned by the former chairman of Citigroup, Sanford I. Weill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was 6,744 square feet and went for more than $13,000 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kyle W. Blackmon, who represented Mr. Weill, has the River House listing, along with another Brown Harris Stevens Broker, John Burger, who has sold many of New York's most expensive apartments.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos  </div><div>544 words</div><div>25 September 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices rose by their fastest pace in more than seven years in July, according to an index released Tuesday, though more-recent data suggest price gains could soon moderate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in 20 major U.S. cities increased 12.4% in July compared with the same month last year, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price inflation has accelerated sharply over the past year as more buyers have chased a shrinking supply of houses for sale. Fewer properties have been selling out of foreclosure, and until May, mortgage rates had hovered near record lows, which let buyers qualify for slightly more debt without significantly increasing their monthly payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising mortgage rates, which are up nearly one percentage point since May, could ultimately test buyers' willingness to pay more. That may have accelerated some purchases from buyers who had initially planned to buy later this year, but it has made other buyers more hesitant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agents and executives have reported slowdowns in sales traffic in August and September. Also, there are signs that investors have begun to step back from the market amid higher prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data releases expected on Wednesday for new-home sales in August and on Thursday for contracts to buy existing homes should provide more up-to-date gauges of demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday's report hinted at a possible slowdown in the rate at which prices are going up. While all 20 cities tracked by the Case-Shiller index gained in July, the pace at which prices rose slowed in 15 cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The slowing in monthly gains is not a nail in the recovery's coffin," said Bill Banfield, director of capital markets at Quicken Loans. "In fact it shows a normalizing of the market and that this growth can be sustained."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices rose 1.8% in July from June. While that was more sluggish than the month-over-month increases in the previous three months, home prices tend to rise fastest in the spring, and they typically peak in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gain in July was still the largest for that month since the Case-Shiller index began its count in 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index tracks home prices on a three-month moving average. Tuesday's report measured prices on home sales that were recorded in the May-to-July period, and buyers would have entered into contracts to buy those homes one or two months before then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices are up most sharply in many of the Western and Southwestern markets that saw some of the biggest declines. Prices have jumped 27.5% in Las Vegas over the past year, while San Francisco's have gained 24.8% and Los Angeles's 20.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising mortgage rates could make it more difficult for sellers to keep asking buyers to pay more, especially in markets that have witnessed some of the sharpest gains. Home builders have been particularly aggressive over the past year raising prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, rising mortgage rates have been "almost like a red light on the frantic price inflation," said Ivy Zelman, chief executive of Zelman &amp; Associates, a research and advisory firm.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Moody's/RCA Commercial Property Price Indices were incorrectly called the Moody's/REAL Commercial Property Price Indices in a Money &amp; Investing article on Sept. 25 about commercial real-estate loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(WSJ October 2, 2013)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Western Alliance Bancorp</span>. got a pleasant surprise in May when it sold a vacant store in Victorville, Calif. out of its foreclosed-property portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Phoenix-based bank had internally marked down the value of the 30,000-square-foot property, which fell into default in June 2012, to $972,000 from the $1.2 million value of the loan. Western Alliance was actually able to book a profit by selling it for $1.1 million to David Hong, who plans to use it to house his clothing-embroidery company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As real estate values have risen, along with demand from buyers, banks are in the better position to dispose of their OREO," Robert Sarver, Western Alliance's chief executive, said in an interview, referring to Other Real Estate Owned, the term the banking industry uses for foreclosed properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising commercial property values throughout the country have enabled banks to cleanse themselves of the mountains of distressed office buildings, shopping centers, hotels and other real estate that they reluctantly took over during the financial downturn. That has helped banks return to health and transferred thousands of properties to new investors who have breathed new life into them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is even more important is what didn't happen. As delinquent loans and OREO swelled, there was widespread fear among regulators that commercial real estate would follow residential real estate off the cliff and deliver another massive blow to the economy. In 2010, bad commercial-real-estate assets hit a postcrisis peak of $146 billion, according to debt research firm <span class="companylink">Trepp LLC</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks posted huge losses and dozens failed due to bad commercial real-estate loans made during the boom years. But the pain wasn't nearly as bad as expected, in large part because banks didn't sell their troubled loans and foreclosed properties during the darkest days of the downturn and values bounced back faster than many expected, banking and real-estate experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks have whittled down the volume of bad loans and OREO to $60 billion by selling assets or working out deals with borrowers, according to Trepp. For commercial OREO alone, the five largest U.S. banks have reduced their holdings to $1.7 billion in the second quarter, down from $3.5 billion in mid-2010, according to the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp</span>. "I sleep a lot easier today," says Julie Stackhouse, a vice president at the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis</span>, which has examined the holdings of banks' foreclosed properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, in the real-estate industry, the steady sale by banks of the troubled assets has boosted a new class of developers and investors. While moguls and institutions have been on the other side of most high-profile distressed sales of assets such as Worldwide Plaza in Manhattan, the great majority of properties sold have been purchased by mom-and-pop investors, immigrants and other smaller players, property brokers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hong, who bought the store in the Victorville strip shopping center, is the 36-year old son of South Korean immigrants. His manufacturing company, X-Treme Stitching, which specializes in baseball hats, will take half the space and the other half will be sublet to retailers, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks are the largest holders of commercial real-estate debt, with about $1.1 trillion of the total $2.1 trillion in commercial mortgages, according to the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>. Many decided in the early years of the crisis not to sell OREO and distressed loans because they wanted to avoid a repeat of the early 1990s, when lenders dumped assets at huge discounts only to see them rebound in value in a few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their strategy this time to hold and extend troubled loans rather than sell was derided by critics as "extend and pretend." But now many who raised red flags at the time say the practice looks smart in hindsight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's worked a lot better than I would have guessed," said Arthur Segel, a real-estate professor at Harvard Business School.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. banks wrote down the value of their commercial real-estate holdings by $134.5 billion between 2007 and 2012, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. But banks are getting better prices as the real-estate market has improved. For example, in 2009, lenders were taking 70% to 80% losses when selling risky assets like raw land, according to Matthew Anderson, a managing director at Trepp. Today that discount is in the 30% to 40% range, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank selling also has picked up in the past few years as values have rebounded. U.S. commercial-property values have increased 42% since hitting their postcrash trough in 2009, according to the <span class="companylink">Moody's</span>/REAL Commercial Property Price Indices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, for commercial loans, the problem hasn't gone away. The cache of OREO and delinquent loans is still far larger than historic levels -- it was $13.6 billion in the first quarter of 2007 for U.S. banks, according to Trepp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many community banks in particular continue to struggle, and banks with less than $1 billion in assets have cut their OREO and delinquent loans by only 40% since 2010, according to Trepp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The steady sale of OREO and troubled loans has helped fuel a virtuous cycle within the commercial-property markets. New owners are reinvesting in buildings, helping boost the value of surrounding properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A set of 16 condominium town houses in La Mesa, Calif., sat vacant for more than four years, after <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>. foreclosed on the nearly-completed project in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, investment group <span class="companylink">Pathfinder Partners LLC</span> bought the property for $3.1 million. After the floors were fixed and lighting fixtures replaced, the town homes are being rented now. Pathfinder co-founder Lorne Polger says he is on track to eventually sell the units for two-thirds more than he paid for them.</p>

</div><div class="author">James Glynn </div><div>681 words</div><div>25 September 2013</div><div>01:13</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SYDNEY—<span class="companylink">Australia's central bank</span> advised the nation's lenders against being too keen to offer mortgages to their customers, saying record low interest rates risked fueling an economically damaging surge in speculative home buying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its routine review of financial stability, the central bank said lenders should maintain the highest standards when offering mortgages, as house prices continue to recover from a long period of stagnation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The low interest-rate setting combined with loose mortgage lending may end up boosting property speculation, it said, posing a risk to the economy if house prices were to drop sharply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government figures show the number of mortgages approved by lenders has risen each month so far this year. Still, the central bank refrained from referring to the accompanying rise in house prices across the country as a bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Lending practices in the residential mortgage market will be an important area to watch," the central bank said in its twice-yearly review of the health of banks and household debt. "A sustained period of below-average interest rates could increase speculative activity in the housing market and encourage marginal borrowers to increase debt."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span> has called on regulators to act to prevent house prices from rising too steeply, recalling the experience of 2008 when reckless mortgage lending triggered the global financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Reserve Bank of Australia</span>'s burgeoning concern over house values has made further immediate rate cuts that could fuel further price gains less likely, some economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The strength of the property market and the comments today raise the bar for further rate cuts," said Paul Brennan, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> in Sydney.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central bank's cautious language comes amid anxiety that the sharp rebound in Australian home values this year has been driven to a significant extent by property investors--particularly in more cosmopolitan cities like Sydney.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Australian house prices rose more than 5% from a year earlier in the second quarter, the fastest pace since 2010, while auction clearance rates and home-loan approvals have also risen, turning the housing market into a rare bright spot in an economy that is slowing as a long mining boom cools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central bank has lowered the official cash-rate target eight times in almost two years to help spur nonmining parts of the country's resources-dominated economy. It left the rate at a record low 2.5% at its last policy meeting, on Sept. 3, and hasn't ruled out further reductions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its review Wednesday, the central bank said lenders needed to resist the temptation to ease borrowing standards as demand for mortgages climbed and competition in the loan market increased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is important they do not respond to pressures to boost revenue by imprudently loosening their lending standards, or by making ill-considered moves into new markets or products," it said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">National Australia Bank Ltd</span>., one of the nation's top four lenders, said it was remaining "cautious" in its approach to mortgage lending. The <span class="companylink">Australian Bankers' Association</span>, an industry group, said there was nothing in the central bank's remarks to indicate concern over current lending practices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Banks are lending responsibly," said Tony Burke, acting chief executive of the lobby group. "There's no doubt home lending is a competitive marketplace, but we're confident banks are lending responsibly because problems aren't emerging."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central bank cautioned home buyers, too, not to have unrealistic expectations about the scope for future house-price rises. It added that households appeared to be steering clear of excessive debt levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Indicators of household stress are low," it said in the review, but added it was concerned an increasing number of property investors were being advised to finance new home purchases with their retirement savings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This type of investment strategy is being heavily promoted," the central bank said, adding that it risked pushing up speculative demand for property.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Spencer Jakab   </div><div>331 words</div><div>23 September 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Asia</div><div>AWSJ</div><div>22</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Federal Reserve showed itself to be a taper tiger last week, one of the sharpest reactions came from U.S. homebuilding stocks. For example, <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> and <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>., which both report quarterly earnings Tuesday, leapt by 9.6% and 6.6% in the last two hours of the trading session, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower rates for longer clearly are positive for companies that sell people the most expensive purchase of their lives on credit. Even so, there are plenty of other positive factors for homebuilders, from rising prices to increasingly compelling demographics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is that these appear to have been priced in well before the prospect of less Fed bond buying and rising interest rates appeared. Despite headline after headline about rising home prices and even bidding wars, not a single major homebuilder has outperformed the broad U.S. market so far this year. A number of them, including <span class="companylink">PulteGroup Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Hovnanian Enterprises Inc</span>., are actually lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Profits are rising for homebuilders, of course. KB is seen earning 21 cents a share for the period through August, compared with four cents a year earlier, and <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> is seen earning 45 cents versus 40 cents, according to FactSet. But earnings will have to get a lot better to compensate for stock gains before 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lennar</span> now trades at 14.8 times the next 12 months' projected earnings and KB is at 17.6 times. In the seven Septembers prior to the bursting of the housing bubble, they traded at 7.62 and 6.57 times on average, respectively. Even on projected 2016 earnings, they appear pricey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barring a much more substantial rise in mortgage rates, the underlying impetus for the housing recovery remains intact.Construction and home sales probably have a long runway ahead of them. Just don't bet the house on it.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sarah Portlock   </div><div>564 words</div><div>20 September 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of previously owned homes rose unexpectedly in August to the highest level since 2007, as buyers rushed to lock in deals before mortgage rates increased further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the industry's trade group warned that sales could slow in the coming months amid higher borrowing costs and home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales rose 1.7% in August from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.48 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Thursday. That was the best month of sales since February 2007, when the housing bubble was just starting to burst. The pace was 13.2% higher than the same period last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is partly due to the rise in interest rates, which again hurries some of the people into making the decision," said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the Realtors' group. August is a lagging indicator of activity in June and July, when rates began their ascent, he said. Economists had predicted sales would fall to a pace of 5.25 million in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figure "is especially encouraging as it suggests that the housing-market recovery is not showing any ill-effects from the recent surge in mortgage rates -- at least not yet," said Millan Mulraine of <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Yun warned the surging home-sales pace could be the "last hurrah" for the next 12 to 18 months as rising rates and home prices start to affect affordability and hold back buyers. Already, real-estate agents are seeing a decline in house tours, Mr. Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A strong housing market has buoyed the economic recovery by improving confidence among consumers, encouraging household spending and generating construction jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising mortgage rates this summer have sparked a rush to buy homes as prospective homeowners want to lock in rates before they climb further. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 4.5% this week, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> said Thursday. That level, while historically low, is well above spring levels of around 3.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates have been increasing in recent months as speculation grew that the Federal Reserve would start winding down its $85-billion-a-month bond-buying program, which was designed in part to push down long-term interest rates. But Wednesday, the central bank said it would keep its program in place as it awaits more evidence that the economic recovery will be sustained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other reports have indicated a slower pace of sales of new homes as buyers adjust to higher rates. Contracts to buy new homes fell by 13.4% in July from June, and some builders and analysts have reported softness in new-home orders during August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If rising mortgage rates are accelerating purchases by some buyers that had been sitting on the fence, that could benefit existing homes over new homes because buyers can't lock in a mortgage rate on a home that is under construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors group said Thursday the median price of an existing home was $212,100, up 14.7% from a year earlier, its strongest gain since October 2005. And inventories of previously owned homes remain tight. The number of homes available for sale in August was 2.25 million, up slightly from July but down 6% from a year ago.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON—Britain's resurgent property market has led to an improvement in the government's finances. As the number of transactions climbs, so does the revenue from taxes on those transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the first indication that the economic recovery is helping Treasury chief George Osborne's task of narrowing the country's budget deficit, which remains one of the highest in Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stamp Duty Land Tax—which is charged in the U.K. on property purchases over £125,000 ($201,000)—has hit its highest level since the financial crisis hit in 2008, data from the tax department, <span class="companylink">HM Revenue and Customs</span> shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, stamp duty totaled £886 million—£203 million higher than the same month last year. The latest figure for August shows stamp duty revenue remains buoyant at £803 million. In comparison, at the height of the recession in 2009, stamp duty plunged to £200 million per month as the property market stalled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in stamp duty was highlighted in public finance data, released Friday, that showed the budget deficit was £13.2 billion in August, lower than the £14.4 billion borrowed in the same month last year, according to the <span class="companylink">Office for National Statistics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent months, economic data have indicated a recovery is beginning to take hold in the U.K. As the economy strengthens it should lead to an improvement in public finances as tax revenues from companies, sales and employment boost government coffers, while the amount the government has to pay in welfare payments such as unemployment benefits declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An ONS statistician Friday said the rise in stamp duty receipts was the first evidence of this improvement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This should aid Mr. Osborne's task of tackling the county's budget deficit, which is forecast to be 6.8% of gross domestic product this year, one of the largest in Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Martin Beck, U.K. economist at Capital Economics, said Friday's data suggests that the economic recovery could be finally starting to make its presence felt in the borrowing figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With signs that economic growth is accelerating, the public sector deficit could well be on course to decline more rapidly than the <span class="companylink">Office for Budget Responsibility</span> [the government budget watchdog] expects," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increased stamp duty take is the latest evidence showing a revival of the U.K. property market, largely as a result of government-sponsored programs to support demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Official figures released Tuesday show that the average U.K. house price was 3.3% higher in July than in the same month last year. A gauge that measures house prices in England, the largest part of the U.K., is now above its precrisis peak of January 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in property prices has ignited fears the U.K. is at risk of inflating a new property bubble, as demand for homes has yet to be matched by a significant increase in supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fiercest criticism has been directed at the government's Help-to-Buy program, which offers cheap loans for home buyers struggling to find the cash for a down payment and taxpayer guarantees to lower the cost of mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One company benefiting from the revival in the property market is U.K. estate agent <span class="companylink">Foxtons Group PLC</span>, which Friday priced its initial public offering at the top of its range and will begin trading with a market value of about £649 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foxtons, which has 40 branches in the London area, said the IPO was priced at 230 pence a share and would raise £390 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company was bought by private-equity firm <span class="companylink">BC Partners</span> in 2007 for £360 million. Foxtons is the second major U.K. estate agent to list its share publicly this year after <span class="companylink">Countrywide PLC</span>, which raised £200 million in March.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WELLINGTON, New Zealand—Economists have long focused on dairy prices when gauging the health of agriculture-rich New Zealand. When a quake destroyed the country's second-largest city in 2011, they turned their eyes to heavy equipment and building materials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, economists are starting to more pay attention to another indicator: household items like the latest liquid-crystal-display televisions and sofas. New Zealand's gathering economic momentum is creating a feel good factor among consumers that is adding to expectations the country will be among the first developed nations to hike interest rates since the global financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Zealand's economy expanded by 2.5% on-year in the second quarter, official figures published Thursday showed. Economists had expected the economy to expand by 2.2%, hurt by a drought earlier in the year that hampered production in the country's dominant dairy industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending by households in the three months through June on durable goods like TVs was the largest in more than six years, Statistics New Zealand said. Economists took that as a signal that the economic recovery was spreading beyond sectors like housing and construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Des Flynn, a customer services manager at national retailer <span class="companylink">The Warehouse Group Ltd</span>., which sells everything from big screen TVs to clothing and furniture, said there is been a "steady increase" in consumer spending over the last few months, with TV sales especially strong across all brands, including international name-brands like <span class="companylink">Sony</span> and the retailer's own brand. "More people are buying and more people are buying more," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer confidence is around a three-year high, house prices are rising and unemployment remains below levels seen last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the second quarter, the economy expanded only 0.2% but it was a "remarkable number when you consider that the agriculturally-leveraged economy of New Zealand was in the midst of one of its worst droughts on record," said Stephen Toplis, head of research at <span class="companylink">Bank of New Zealand</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While agricultural output was down 6.4% on the quarter "households, buoyed by rising house prices, increasing employment, ultralow interest rates, and modest real wage growth are spending up large," Mr. Toplis said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government in March declared a drought across the entire North Island and parts of the South Island, saying it could shave more than 2 billion New Zealand dollars (US$1.7 billion) off the NZ$200 billion economy. Still, a construction boom led by Christchurch, where a string of earthquakes since early 2011 have caused more than US$34 billion in damage, has helped fuel activity in previously weak parts of the economy like retail sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Aside from drought-induced volatility, the New Zealand economy is firmly in the grip of a widespread upturn," said Westpac Chief Economist Dominick Stephens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House prices in Auckland, a city experiencing rapid population growth, rose 13% on-year in August, while in Christchurch, prices rallied 11% over the same period amid an ongoing housing shortage. Nationwide prices are up 8.5% on-year. That is flowing through to service industries like architecture firms and realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We haven't seen this level of activity for a long time," said Lisa Hinton, a practice director of Context Architects, which has offices in Auckland and Christchurch. Record-low interest rates are spurring residential construction, she said, adding that the firm plans to add three staff to meet growing demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Zealand's central bank has held its policy interest rate steady for more than two years, but rising costs of housing and construction may force it to act before the end of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nick Tuffley, chief economist for <span class="companylink">ASB Bank</span>, said the <span class="companylink">Reserve Bank of New Zealand</span> may hold off until March next year but "the risks are skewed to a slightly earlier or more aggressive start" given heat in the housing sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Zealand experienced a housing boom in the early 2000s, fueled by easy credit and a local preference for investing in the housing sector. At the time, the central bank tried to moderate house prices by boosting the cash rate, with little success. With so much of the country's wealth tied up in housing, when prices eventually did fall the nation dipped into a recession even before the global financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sydney-based <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Canada</span> economist Michael Turner said that while growth was starting to spread beyond the construction sector, "there is not much sign of inflation at the moment and the currency is still fairly strong" which will likely keep the cash rate unchanged for now.</p>

</div><div class="author">Esther Fung  </div><div>662 words</div><div>18 September 2013</div><div>08:07</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHANGHAI—Average new-home prices in 70 Chinese cities rose faster in August than at any time since January 2011 despite government measures to keep property prices in check, spurred by strong home-buying in major cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the seventh straight month of price increases compared with year-earlier levels, data released Wednesday by the National Bureau of Statistics showed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Month-on-month price gains also picked up, after moderating for the previous four months, signaling limited impact of the government's tightening measures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central government has been tightening property-sector controls for nearly four years to rein in surging house prices, restricting second-home purchases and slowing the flow of credit to developers. But Beijing is also concerned that excessive curbs on the housing sector could derail the country's fragile economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Liu Jianwei, a statistician from the statistics bureau, said in a separate commentary that the jump in year-over-year prices was partly due to a lower base of comparison and that the sequential gains in new-home prices have moderated since March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The statistics bureau's continued effort to paint a picture of still-benign housing-price conditions may imply that the central government wants to deal with other issues first before making a very clear stand," said Jinsong Du, a <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> analyst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said this indicates that new tightening measures, particularly national curbs, are unlikely to be rolled out in the near term, though may come after a meeting of senior Communist Party officials in November, where leaders are expected to discuss key policy objectives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts and government researchers have called for more sustainable measures, such as land overhaul and property taxes, to rein in the real-estate market, rather than relying on moves such as limits on home purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Entrenched imbalances in the housing market, such as strong demand in major cities and oversupply in smaller cities, as well as local governments' reliance on revenue from land sales, have complicated Beijing's efforts on home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in August rose an average 7.5% from a year earlier, compared with 6.7% in July, calculations by The Wall Street Journal showed. Prices were up an average 0.79% month-over-month in August after a 0.68% gain in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices of new homes in 66 of the 70 large and medium-size cities surveyed rose in August from July. In July, prices rose in 62 cities. Year-on-year, prices were up in 69 cities in August, the same as July's tally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average home prices in large cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou recorded strong on-year gains in August. Beijing prices rose 14.9%, above the 14.1% gain in July, and Shanghai prices advanced 15.4% from a 13.7% increase. In Guangzhou, prices were up 18.8%, accelerating from the 17.2% gain the previous month and in Shenzhen, average home prices rose 18.1%, picking up from a 16.6% rise in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While developers may be pleased with the sales increases, they are wary of rising land costs. The land market in major cities has seen breakneck price appreciation in recent months as companies aggressively buy more land. The record prices have caused them to take a longer-term view on their operations, holding on to already-developed areas and shifting away from a purely "build-and-sell" model.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're adopting a more sustainable model of property development, including tourism elements such as having hot springs in our projects, which will add value to our property," said Tracy Wong, vice president of Rong Hui Group, a closely held developer in Fuzhou. "Now with scarcity of land, we can't just depend on sales and can't keep replenishing our land bank."</p>

</div><div class="author">Jonathan House </div><div>628 words</div><div>18 September 2013</div><div>06:50</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home construction picked up in August, indicating continued growth for the sector despite recent signs of softening demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. housing starts rose 0.9% from July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 891,000, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. That was less than the 915,000 forecast by economists and below the five-year high of just over 1 million they hit in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the August home starts were driven by a 7% increase in single-family homes, which account for the biggest share of the market and represent a more significant barometer of the sector's health. The volatile multifamily category fell 11%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits, an indicator of future construction, fell 3.8% in August overall, though they rose 3% to 627,000 for single family homes, their highest level since May 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family housing starts rose in all major regions last month, while single-family permits rose in every region except the Northeast, where they were flat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The breadth of the gains adds to the picture of sustainability in the housing market recovery," economists at RDQ Economics said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home starts have been volatile in recent months, though they have been trending higher and providing key support to the economic recovery. Home building creates jobs as well as demand for a broad array of building materials and household goods. The sector's growth, however, has been held back by supply constraints as the industry emerges from its long slump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some recent data have also shown signs of softening demand for housing after a rapid run-up in prices and as mortgage rates rise from historically low levels. Rates have been climbing since the Federal Reserve signaled earlier this year it could start reining in a bond-buying program designed to keep financing costs low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed officials could announce a decision to start the pullback at the end of a two-day meeting later Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage stood at 4.57% last week, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, still a historically low level but higher from the spring, when rates dipped below 3.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher rates appear to be tempering optimism in the sector. The steady rise of home-builder confidence paused in September, according to a gauge released Tuesday by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>. The NAHB said its index remains at its highest level since November 2005, but many builders are "reporting some hesitancy on the part of buyers due to the sharp increase in interest rates."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent reports from the government and the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> showed declines in housing sales in July, while the rapid run-up in prices has started to ease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices rose 12.1% for the year ended in June, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index, which tracks prices in 20 major U.S. metro areas, down slightly from a gain of 12.2% for the 12 months ended in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, home builders and economists say more homes are needed to meet rising demand driven by a gradually improving labor market and interest rates that remain historically low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We look for [home-] start activity to continue to move broadly higher in coming months as rising prices and lean inventories boost demand," said <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> economist Cooper Howes. "We expect that residential investment will provide a positive contribution to GDP growth in coming quarters despite the recent month-to-month volatility in start."</p>

</div><div class="author">Nicholas Winning </div><div>1421 words</div><div>17 September 2013</div><div>05:49</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GLASGOW, Scotland—The U.K. isn't in the early stages of a fresh house-price bubble and the government will proceed with the next stage of its support program for new home buyers, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview on the sidelines of the Liberal Democrats' annual conference, Danny Alexander also said his party intends to see out the full five-year term of the coalition government with Prime Minister David Cameron's Conservative Party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Alexander is the second most senior minister in the Treasury—behind Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne—and his comments on the Help-To-Buy program highlight a lack of agreement about its potential risks among economists, trade bodies, and ministers, including within the junior coalition party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The treasury minister said the biggest problem in the residential property market was a lack of supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Help-to-Buy is the right thing to be doing," he said, adding that he didn't foresee the government wrapping up the program before it is due to end in three years' time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Official figures released Tuesday show that the average U.K. house price was 3.3% higher in July than in the same month last year. A gauge that measures house prices in England, the largest part of the U.K., is now above its precrisis peak of January 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in property prices has triggered concerns—voiced by Business Secretary and fellow Lib Dem lawmaker Vince Cable among others—that the government's policies may be inflating a new house price bubble. The fiercest criticism has been directed at the Help-to-Buy program, which offers cheap loans for home buyers struggling to find the cash for a down payment and taxpayer guarantees to lower the cost of mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House builders report that the Help-To-Buy program has been a shot in the arm for the sector, but the speed of the recovery has meant profit margins have been squeezed in some areas by a shortage of materials and laborers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen Stone, chief executive of home construction firm <span class="companylink">Crest Nicholson PLC</span>, said Tuesday that he expected the firm to hit a target of 2,500 homes built by the end of 2014. In January it said it would take at least three years to reach that goal. Still, getting hold of bricks and tiles takes twice as long as it did before Help to Buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Galliford Try</span>, another builder, said it is having to pay bricklayers up to 20% more than it was six months ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What would have been a gradual increase in unit numbers is instead a shock, so house builders are struggling to come to grips with that," said Chief Executive Greg Fitzgerald.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cable has questioned whether the second phase of the Help-To-Buy program due to start next year should go ahead. On Monday he suggested the government should look into restricting it to specific areas of the country. Much of the increase in house prices has been fueled by London and southeast while the market in other parts of Britain has been more sluggish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Underscoring the growing concerns over the risk of a new housing bubble, the <span class="companylink">Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors</span> trade body said on Friday that the <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span> should use its powers to prevent house prices in the U.K. rising by more than 5% a year. Firmly anchored house price expectations would limit excessive risk taking and help limit an unsustainable rise in debt, it said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BOE Governor Mark Carney has said that aside from some pockets, housing market activity in the U.K. remains below precrisis levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We do need to be vigilant about this, but we also need to look at the starting point," Mr. Carney told a parliamentary committee Thursday. "There are big pockets in the country where there has not been any meaningful recovery in the housing market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking ahead to the next general election in 2015, Mr. Alexander said his party was committed to keeping the coalition alive until the election is held.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, Mr. Cable also said it was "certainly possible" that the Lib Dems and the Conservatives could go their separate ways a few months before the election, which is due in 2015, a rare comment on an issue ministers seek to avoid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's our intention as a party to make sure this coalition sees out its full term," Mr. Alexander said. "The last thing you do as a party of government is walk away with a few months to go."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Alexander said there were good early signs that the economy was recovering in a balanced way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But also it's very early days and there is a lot more work to be done to make sure that it is a lasting recovery. So I don't think there's any sense... of complacency, that we can take our foot of the gas. Quite the opposite," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.K. economy expanded by 0.7% in the second quarter and in recent weeks a run of strong economic data and surveys have indicated that the recovery is gathering pace. The <span class="companylink">Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development</span> said this month that it expects economic growth in the U.K. to outpace the U.S., Germany, France and Japan in the second half of 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In new guidance, the <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span> has said it would not consider changing its ultralow interest rates or reversing its additional monetary stimulus program until the U.K. unemployment rate falls to 7%, which it forecasts won't happen until 2016. The latest official figures show the unemployment rate was 7.7% in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, in a sign that investors are more bullish about the economic outlook, financial markets are pricing in an interest rate rise in the second quarter of 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We broadened slightly the bank's mandate earlier this year and the bank is rightly operating within the wider flexibility that they have using tools that are used in other parts of the world," Mr. Alexander said. "It seems to me that markets respond rationally to those signals and that's the whole basis on which the bank is operating its policy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People should believe what the <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span> says, I certainly do," he said, declining further comment on monetary policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rising cost of living is fast becoming a key political battleground after several years in which inflation has outpaced wage growth. Mr. Alexander said he hoped workers would benefit as firms start to grow, but the government was also helping by raising the income tax threshold to £10,000, a level Lib Dems say they want to raise further in the next parliament.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Alexander is due to give a speech at his party conference later in which he will say taxes on the wealthy will be one of the Lib Dems' central promises for the next parliament. He explained that the party would be targeting accumulated wealth rather than earnings and it didn't have a set definition for wealthy people in salary terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the party's key tax offerings at the next general election is likely to be is long-standing plan for a so-called "mansion tax"—a 1% levy on the value of homes valued at more than £2 million—a measure they say could raise about £2 billion a year but which is opposed by the Conservatives, who say it would be expensive and ineffective.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday the Lib Dems accidentally sent to reporters an internal document for lawmakers' eyes only that said it was looking at how those earning more than £50,000 ($79,328) a year could make a "further contribution" in taxes. The party quickly said it was a mistake and not its policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have no plans to increase any of the rates of income tax. None of the income-tax rates will go up under the Liberal Democrats," Mr. Alexander said. "So on the value of a home over £2 million you would pay a bit extra, and we would reduce the tax relief on pension contributions. The Liberals basically believe in taxing work, effort and income less and accumulations of wealth, particularly unearned wealth, more."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a yearlong rally, the U.S. housing market is showing signs of cooling as higher prices and interest rates, a slowdown in investor purchases and shortages of homes for sale weigh on one of the economy's brightest sectors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While few economists and industry watchers believe the housing recovery will stall, there is growing evidence that the exuberance that prompted bidding wars and led to double-digit price gains is easing. Redfin, an online real-estate brokerage, said its agents had multiple bids on 61% of its homes in August, down from 76% in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's clear there will be some moderation in demand," said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors. He noted that the use of electronic "lockboxes" used by listing agents, an indicator of foot traffic at homes on the market, showed a "measurable decline" during August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some closely watched measures of housing activity, including sales of previously owned homes, may not yet capture the full extent of any slowdown, in part because they measure sales that went under contract earlier in the summer when activity was still robust. The Realtors group is set to report Thursday on existing home sales for August, which will show completed sales of homes that went into contracts one to two months earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consensus of economists surveyed last week by Dow Jones Newswires estimates that the pace of sales fell to a 5.24 million seasonally adjusted annual rate in August, down about 3% from July but ahead of last year's 4.84 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent reports by some of the nation's biggest new-home builders look worse. <span class="companylink">Hovnanian Enterprises Inc</span>. last week blamed higher home prices and interest rates on a 12.7% decline in new orders during July and August versus those months last year. "In hindsight, we might have been a little bit aggressive with our price increases," said Ara Hovnanian, the company's chief executive, on an investor call.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales declined 4% in August from July, according to a survey by John Burns Real Estate Consulting. New-home orders rose by just 1% from a year earlier, compared with year-to-year gains of 11% in July and 25% during the second quarter, according to research firm Zelman &amp; Associates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates have climbed more than a full percentage point over the past four months, to around 4.8% last week for the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage from 3.6% in May, as investors predict that the Federal Reserve will wind down measures that had pushed mortgage rates to rock-bottom levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some real-estate agents believe new homes will be hurt more than existing homes because builders have been more aggressive in raising prices on new homes and because buyers can't close quickly on homes that haven't been built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers "want to lock something in before the rate gets away from them," said Brett Dickinson, a real-estate agent with <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span> in San Diego.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, there is often a slowdown in real-estate sales between the summer and fall, as school starts up and families look to stay put. And some real-estate agents welcome a slowdown because it eases their fears that prices were rising too fast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some agents say the biggest problem in the market is "seller greed" -- that is, sellers pricing their homes too high, said Jim Klinge, a real-estate agent in Carlsbad, Calif. Faced with rising rates, buyers aren't going for higher prices. "They don't realize our 12- to 18-month full-tilt boogie is over," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While higher rates and prices are knocking marginal buyers out of the market, others, like Ghalib and Nancy Wahidi, will remain in the market but look for a less expensive house. The Wahidis' original price range topped out at $1.2 million, but they reduced it after rates went up, said Dr. Wahidi, a 38-year-old physician. They are set to close this week on a four-bedroom $1.03 million home in Ladera Ranch, Calif., around 4% below its original list price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sarah Withers and her husband accelerated their decision to buy a home in August after rates increased. She said they are willing to pay $1,000 to get out of their apartment lease, which runs through next April. Last week, they signed a contract to buy a three-bedroom townhouse for $115,000. After the house sat on the market for a month, the sellers reduced the price, drawing four offers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We don't believe that the recent increases in mortgage rate are going to in any way, shape or form snuff out the housing recovery," said Timothy Sloan, chief financial officer at <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo &amp; Co</span>., at an investor conference last week. It wasn't logical, he added, to expect double-digit price gains to last forever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, any slowdown in home construction could take a bite out of the economy's already slow growth rate. Steve Capen, a real-estate broker with <span class="companylink">Keller Williams Realty</span> in St. Petersburg, Fla., had planned on hiring another agent or assistant this year. "Now, there wouldn't be a need for it," he said. "We have to work harder to find the buyers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To some extent, the housing market has become a victim of its surprising success. The inventory of existing homes for sale has plunged to a 4.8-month supply in July from twice that in July 2010, according to the Realtors' group. Inventory has risen six straight months even after adjusting for seasonal factors, according to <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, a real-estate listings service, but it remains low by historical levels, frustrating some buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Burt's biggest complaint is the lack of attractive homes on the market in Scottsdale, Ariz. "They're pretty few and far between," said the 40-year-old lawyer. He recently narrowed his search to homes that don't need any renovations. "When you're looking at rates hovering around 5%, it really takes a bite out of your buying power," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, prices have ramped up so fast that investors, whose purchases helped ignite the recovery, have pulled back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, the share of investors buying homes was 18% in July, down from 20% one year earlier, according to the Campbell Housing Pulse Survey.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anya Martin   </div><div>751 words</div><div>13 September 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In hot markets where bidding wars are common, the property-appraisal process has been short-circuiting transactions, spurring some would-be buyers to walk away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few forces are at work. First, many homes are being appraised at a lower price than what buyers have offered on a house. That is because home values are improving so fast in competitive, high-priced markets that "comps," recent sales of nearby homes with comparable characteristics, haven't kept up. When the appraisal comes in low, the buyers either lose the loan or must quickly make up the difference with a higher down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The impact can be significant, said Peter Grabel, a senior mortgage loan originator at Stamford, Conn.-based Luxury Mortgage. A jumbo borrower required to put 20% down on a $1 million purchase expects to pay $200,000. But if the home appraises at $900,000, the down payment goes up to $280,000 -- the sum of the $100,000 shortfall plus the $180,000 down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A second deal-breaker can be the length of time it takes to get an appraisal. "I had one buyer call up and say 'I'm dying a slow, painful death waiting for the appraisal to come in,'" said Sara Benson, president of Chicago-based <span class="companylink">Benson Stanley Realty</span> who specializes in luxury homes. "I'd never heard that before."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Appraisals of luxury properties tend to be more complex and results may not be ready until as many as 20 days into the loan process, said Allen Cravello, president of El Segundo, Calif.-based mortgage lender and broker <span class="companylink">American Capital Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To help predict appraisal issues, Mr. Cravello said he runs the home value through an online tool called Cloud Real Estate Network, developed by Denver-based EMC2 Data. It uses Multiple Listing Service data, generally only available to real-estate professionals, to analyze comparable properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Delays can also mean losing an interest-rate lock, particularly risky with anticipated rate increases. For example, between May 24 and June 28, rates on a 30-year, fixed-rate jumbo mortgage rose almost a full percentage point from 3.98% to 4.72%, according to HSH.com, a mortgage-information website.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A third force scuttling some transactions is the mortgage-contingency clause in many contracts. That clause allows buyers to walk away from a deal without penalty if they can't get a mortgage; the contingency includes loans that fall through because of a low appraisal. In hot markets, many sellers won't accept an offer that comes with the mortgage contingency -- even if the buyers are preapproved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hana Karar, 31, a senior producer at ABC News, and her husband, Kashif Zafar, 33, head of e-book sales for <span class="companylink">Barnes &amp; Noble</span> Nook, have been saving for the past three years to buy a New York condo. "We need more space and wanted to upgrade; plus, the amount we would have to pay in rent was exceeding what a mortgage payment would be so it made sense," Ms. Karar said in an email.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At multiple open houses, seller's agents told the couple that their offers wouldn't be considered if they didn't waive the mortgage-contingency clause. In another case, a two-bedroom, 1 1/2-bathroom co-op apartment in Brooklyn's Cobble Hill was priced at $859,000. Mr. Zafar and Ms. Karar were encouraged to make an offer and bid $975,000, but the sellers accepted a lower bid that had no mortgage contingency, Ms. Karar said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here a few more appraisal considerations:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Proactive appraisals. If borrowers suspect appraiser error, they can also request an additional appraisal from a lender, file a rebuttal letter in the slim chance the appraisal will be overturned, or switch lenders to get a new appraisal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Prescreen the appraiser. Ms. Benson recently demanded a lender reassign an appraiser for a $2 million downtown Chicago cooperative after discovering that the appraiser was an uncertified trainee from an office an hour away from the property who had never appraised a cooperative before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Share info. Federal regulations prevent a lender from interacting directly with the appraiser, but those rules don't prohibit a real-estate agent from providing relevant information about the property, such as upgrades, special features, architect name or neighborhood characteristics, said Michael Vargas, president of New York-based Vanderbilt Appraisal Co., which specializes in high-end homes.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Lauren Schuker Blum and Candace Jackson </div><div>1834 words</div><div>13 September 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What attracts this generation of wealthy second-home buyers: zip lines, kids clubs and grilled cheese sandwiches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For decades focused on golf, skiing or hunting, today's master-planned resorts are being reimagined as fancy family camps, a trend that's helping revive a number of struggling high-end second-home communities. Developers say they're aiming to please everyone from toddlers to great-grandparents by merging luxurious trappings with amenities like bowling alleys, soda shops and video arcades. It's all designed to woo wealthy buyers on the hunt for a perfect family vacation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These days, you can't just offer a Jack Nicklaus golf course and instantly be successful," says Chris Fair, president of Resonance Consultancy, which advises developers of destination homes and resort communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shift comes after several difficult years in some second-home markets. Residential resorts made up some of the hardest hit real estate during the downturn: Some residential golf communities sold lots for $1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, interest in kid-focused activities has boomed. There's a "child-centricity" in families that didn't exist in previous generations, says Jon Last, president of Sports &amp; Leisure Research Group, which provides customized research to marketing professionals. Fathers have nearly tripled the amount of time they spend with children, from 2.5 hours a week in 1965 to 7.3 hours per week in 2011, according to a recently released Pew Research report that analyzed years of time-use data. Also, as people are living longer and traveling much later in their lives, vacationing with both parents and grandchildren has become more commonplace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first to capitalize were luxury hotel chains like the <span class="companylink">Ritz-Carlton</span>, which turned some of its properties into five-star playgrounds, complete with game rooms, movie nights and kids classes on everything from marine biology to pastry-making. <span class="companylink">Ritz-Carlton</span> launched its first major kids programs in the early 1990s, and have expanded them greatly since, according a spokeswoman. "As hotels began offering more of these amenities, buyers began expecting them more when they were on vacation," says Mr. Fair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it opened to members in 2000, the Yellowstone Club in Montana was touted as one of the most exclusive clubs in the country, boasting 13,600 acres with private skiing and golf, and members like Bill Gates and former Vice President Dan Quayle. It certainly remains among the more expensive: Although prices are down about 30% from their prerecession peak, according to real-estate agent Tim Murphy, home sites currently begin at $1.5 million, with single-family homes starting at $3.5 million and climbing up to $26.5 million for a full ranch. In addition, owners must pay $32,000 in annual membership dues and a $300,000 refundable deposit upon joining.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, the club filed for bankruptcy protection. The following year, a group of investors bought the club for $115 million in a bankruptcy auction. One of those investors, <span class="companylink">Discovery Land Co</span>., an Arizona-based real-estate developer that took over the club's operations in 2009, installed a bevy of family-friendly amenities, including a "20 Below" arena that includes a climbing wall, movie theater, videogame area and a diner with kid-friendly fare like grilled-cheese sandwiches. It created a club for younger children with baby sitting and installed "sugar shacks" -- small cabins stocked with candy and treats -- all over the mountain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strategy appears to be working. Last year the club added 35 members compared with 10 in 2009. By the end of the summer of 2013, it had added 45 new members to its ranks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, Nick Woodman, the newly minted billionaire who founded and now is chief executive of digital-camera company GoPro, and his wife bought 34 acres along a ridgeline with a 10,000-square-foot furnished Montana-style home at the Yellowstone Club. "It was really the family-oriented nature of the club that made it a no-brainer for us," says Mr. Woodman, who has two young children. Although he declined to comment on the purchase price, people familiar with the club's real estate estimate that Mr. Woodman spent in excess of $20 million on the home and its land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a kid-friendly atmosphere may appeal to some buyers, it also poses a challenge for the resort: making sure that the family focus doesn't turn off a more traditional skiing and golf constituency that is used to exclusive amenities aimed at adults. At Yellowstone, the golf course doesn't have a strict dress code, and there are no tee times, giving the course a more casual feel. But that approach can sometimes backfire. Mr. Woodman says that the club's family-friendly attitude means that it often gets "a bad rap" from the skiing community for being "too easy" of a mountain. "But nobody who actually skis it thinks that," he says. The Yellowstone Club's Director of Sales Bill Collins says the club offers skiing for all levels, from beginners up to the most advanced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pine Creek Sporting Club, a private resort community in Okeechobee, Fla., was originally conceived around 2006 as a traditional hunting club with 23 ranch properties of 40 acres each and amenities including a clubhouse, dog kennels and shooting facilities. But by the time developers broke ground in late 2007, in the midst of the economic downturn, they decided to re-brand the property as a 2,400-acre family-centric resort with both ranch properties and smaller cabins, with hunting as just one of many activities available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the club has a swimming pool and spa, a fitness center and a 600-foot-long zip line that runs across a small lake. There are overnight camping trips and, soon, an Outdoor Pursuits center for kids. A clubhouse wall is lined with photos of member families, and a library is being converted into a game room with coolers that will stock soft drinks and juice boxes. John Reynolds, director of sales and marketing, says about 40% of members are hunters. The other 60% are attracted to the outdoorsy, family-friendly activities. Smaller cabins start at $700,000 and larger ranches, each with 40 acres, range from $2 million to $5 million. The $22,500 annual dues cover most of the amenities and activities, including overnight camping trips for kids (spa treatments, some overnight trips and restaurant meals are additional).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, Karin Taylor, a full-time mom from Palm Beach, Fla., bought a 5,600-square-foot home on 40 acres at Pine Creek with her husband, who runs an industrial buying group. "We really see this as where our kids will have a lot of family memories," says Ms. Taylor, who has five children ranging in age from 3 to 10. "We really weren't interested in being part of a place that didn't welcome the kids." On a recent afternoon, the kids got a hunting-dog demonstration and played in a playground area near a large tree house. Ms. Taylor says they spent about $2 million on their ranch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Martis Camp -- a 2,177-acre resort near the north shore of Lake Tahoe that developer DMB/Highlands Group started in 2006 -- amenities aimed at families have helped to ramp up sales in recent years, says Brian Hull, the club's director of sales. There is a family barn that features a bowling alley, a 44-seat movie theater, a swimming area, soda fountain, indoor basketball courts and an outdoor amphitheater. A soccer field, a softball diamond and a barbecue area are nearby. And for the artistically inclined, there's a "folk school" with classes in photography and pottery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, the club sold 117 properties for $115 million, a step up from the 73 properties it sold in 2010 for $72 million. So far this year, the developer has sold 103 properties for $128 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BJ Jenkins, chief executive of computer security and storage company <span class="companylink">Barracuda Networks</span>, and his wife purchased a 3,250-square-foot modern ski chalet-style home with four bedrooms at Martis Camp last year. The home has become "a gathering place for the entire family," says Mr. Jenkins, who recently had 14 family members stay at his house. "When we get there, we just relax." The couple paid about $3 million for the property, according to people familiar with Martis Camp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As golfers have been replaced by families, developers are starting to restructure their fees. At Martis Camp, regular members pay an annual fee of $8,900 a year, but golf memberships cost $15,400. At Palmetto Bluff, a 20,000-acre club in Bluffton, S.C., developers recently introduced a lower-priced "social golf" membership at $2,500 per year that includes just 12 rounds of golf. Full-fledged golf members pay a $75,000 refundable deposit upfront, and then $5,500 per year in dues. All homeowners pay $6,650 per year in fees, which includes access to hiking trails, use of kayaks, the fitness center, bike rentals and other activities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some communities are also rethinking their architecture. At Yellowstone, a more contemporary look is taking hold, replacing the old mountain style log-and-stone home. The club is planning a renovation of its golf clubhouse with the architect who built the most contemporary residential house on the property -- a 10,000-square-foot structure for new members Steve Taylor, a Las Vegas-based entrepreneur, and his wife, Sascha. The Taylors spent about $10 million to build their home, which has travertine floors, 25-foot-tall ceilings, and 40-foot-tall glass windows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Nobody else here has the percentage of glass that we do," says Mr. Taylor while sitting in his living room, which is decorated with sleek black couches and petrified, polished wood stumps from Indonesia. "It's definitely a different look for Yellowstone, but people here have been very supportive of it." Ms. Taylor says that she and her husband are looking forward to raising their daughter, Isabelle, in the club's friendly, social atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, <span class="companylink">Discovery Land Co</span>., which operates Yellowstone, has more family-centered resorts planned, including an 82-lot private golf club in Quogue, N.Y., and a 260-unit property in Millbrook, N.Y., with a golf course, equestrian center and farm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Meldman, the company's founder and chief executive, says he got the idea to focus on kids' activities from personal experience. "I became a single parent when my kids were very young and I was always trying to create fun, sporty experiences for them without a huge hassle," he says. "My philosophy is that the one thing people can't get more of is time with their families. So that's what we offer."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the core of the financial crisis was a creature called a subprime mortgage bond, and among the more toxic was one with the bland name of CWABS 2006-7.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Made entirely out of loans from <span class="companylink">Countrywide Financial Corp</span>., the bond was so battered by delinquencies in 2009 it appeared that nearly all of the thousands of mortgages inside the bond could default.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One might think that today, such a relic of misbegotten lending would be as dead as orbiting space junk. Instead, CWABS 2006-7 is alive and well, a sought-after asset that has made big profits for savvy investors. A senior slice of it now trades at 91 cents on the dollar, having come nearly all the way back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has been a boon for firms such as bond giant Pimco, whose stake in the Countrywide bond has helped make one of Pimco's funds a top performer in its category.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the bond has affected the lives of struggling Florida homeowners, some unable to make their payments and others, such as Amanda Gavini of Fort Myers, determinedly continuing to do so at above-market mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For others still, such as an immigrant from Russia named Alimzhon Iznurov, the bond and the homes tied to it have spelled an opportunity to snap up housing for their families at a bargain price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story of the bond called CWABS 2006-7—its borrowers, its investors and others touched by it—is the financial crisis seen from inside, illuminating complexities that often upended expectations and dealt widely differing fates to its many participants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wall Street Journal, using real-estate records and the bond's financial reports, tracked down three dozen homeowners whose loans are bundled in CWABS 2006-7. Few knew that or were aware of the possible effect this could have on their mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CWABS 2006-7 appeared in June 2006 as the run-up in home values and Wall Street's mortgage-securitization machine hit peak velocity, fed by newfangled lending that enabled millions of people with spotty credit to become homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These were the final months before the realization sank in that many borrowers couldn't repay, a notion that undermined subprime-mortgage bonds and set off a chain reaction engulfing mortgage-finance firms <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, major banks and even the world's biggest insurance company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Countrywide bundled 5,954 of its subprime loans into the bond, loans carrying interest rates as high as 15% but with an average of 8.5%. Some included special features to accommodate people less able to buy, such as letting them pay only the interest at first. Countrywide offered pieces of the bond for sale, the highest-yielding slices for those willing to bear the most risk and vice versa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the largest initial investors was <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, which put up more than $300 million to buy a top-rated slice at 100 cents on the dollar. Part of the rationale for government-sponsored <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> was that such investing helped more Americans afford to become homeowners, securities filings by the mortgage firms said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lawsuit later filed by <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>'s overseer, the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span>, said that Fannie and Freddie poured more than $26 billion into Countrywide residential mortgage-backed securities from mid-2005 to early 2008. The bonds were "supposed to represent long-term stable investments,'' said the suit, adding that instead, Countrywide borrowers defaulted at a "staggering" rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The suit in New York state court claimed that Countrywide had doled out loans that people weren't suited for and couldn't afford. Defendants Countrywide and its new owner, <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>., dispute the claims in the suit, which is still pending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In early 2009, as U.S. unemployment rose and home prices fell, "people were starting to consider the possibility that every loan in [the bond] would default,'' said Cory Lambert, vice president of analytics at BlackBox Logic LLC, a mortgage-bond research firm. Delinquencies were rising so fast "there was no telling when or if they would ever level off."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bond slice owned by <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> was down more than half in value by the summer of 2009. That was when Countrywide borrower Donald Mudd first started missing his payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and his wife, Patricia Starr, had gotten their loan in March 2006—about three months after Mr. Mudd emerged from a personal bankruptcy involving unpaid medical bills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I was surprised they approved me right after a bankruptcy," said Mr. Mudd.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple received a $171,000 adjustable-rate loan from Countrywide, county records show, and put down $10,000 to buy a two-bedroom house in Port Charlotte, Fla., a retirement haven on the Gulf of Mexico where home values soared 63% from 2004 to 2006. Countrywide put the 30-year, 8% mortgage into CWABS 2006-7.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With his business of selling water-filtration systems hitting headwinds, Mr. Mudd discussed with <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> the possibility of changing his loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government had just created a plan called the Home Affordable Modification Program, or HAMP. Mr. Mudd said the bank rejected him because the investor in his mortgage didn't participate in the program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokeswoman for <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> said it has no record that was the reason Mr. Mudd was denied a loan modification that year. She said the problem was that Mr. Mudd's approximately $1,200 monthly loan payment in 2009 didn't consume a big enough share of his income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By this time, the riskiest slices of CWABS 2006-7 had been hammered by loan defaults, and losses were spreading toward senior slices, once rated triple-A, that often were owned by large financial institutions. For banks, the sinking value meant having to hold more reserves against losses, plus a threat of huge losses if they tried to unload the bonds in a crumbling market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fate of bonds such as CWABS 2006-7, in other words, was strangling banks' lending ability—at a time when the economy needed it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To put a floor under the bonds, the Treasury Department helped firms willing to step in and buy some. It created a taxpayer-funded initiative called the Public-Private Investment Program, or PPIP, through which the U.S. provided debt and equity investments to nine bond buyers, totaling $18.6 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For these investors, the government financing added five percentage points to returns, estimates one participant, New York hedge-fund firm <span class="companylink">Marathon Asset Management</span>. The government made some unusual requests, including asking Marathon to build a wall in its trading floor to separate PPIP trades from its other business, though Marathon never actually built the wall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While buying some subprime bonds through the program, Marathon invested in other bonds outside of it, including CWABS 2006-7. The firm invested starting in early 2009 and throughout that year as the price dipped and then started to recover, according to people familiar with the trades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 43% of the mortgages in the bond were from California and Florida, hard-hit markets that Marathon figured would have solid recoveries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marathon sold its holdings in the bond throughout 2010. The firm declined to say how it made out, but the bond was recovering during this time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The PPIP "not only established a bottom but it had the effect of facilitating a recovery in the asset class," said Andrew Rabinowitz, Marathon's chief operating officer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal support wasn't the only thing buoying CWABS 2006-7. It also benefited from steady payments by homeowners such as Mrs. Gavini in Fort Myers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With her husband, she paid $398,000 for their three-bedroom house in April 2006, taking out two Countrywide loans, with interest rates of 11% and 7%. By late 2009, she figured the house was worth only half what she owed on it. But despite being "underwater," she has never stopped making payments on the loans, monthly payments that now total $3,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I wouldn't be able to sleep at night" not making the payments, said Mrs. Gavini, a mother of two young children who works as a sourcing manager for a women's-apparel retailer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her resolve to pay is just part of the reason the bond continues to gain from Mrs. Gavini's situation. The bond also benefits because she is stuck with her interest rate, which is 7% in the case of her loan that is in the bond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After steady repayment for seven years, plus employment, Mrs. Gavini has good credit, so that refinancing at today's low rates into a prime loan might bring her monthly payment down by nearly half, mortgage brokers say. But because they owe more than the home is worth, she and her husband, Stephen Gavini, can't refinance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is, in fact, a federal program that lets some borrowers in this fix refinance. Called HARP, for Home Affordable Refinance Program, it allows homeowners to lower their payments by extending the life of the loan or dropping their interest rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But to qualify, mortgages must be guaranteed by a government-sponsored firm such as <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> or <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. While those firms could invest in bonds stuffed with subprime mortgages, they didn't guarantee such mortgages. That left out Mrs. Gavini.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not fair,'' she said. "All we want to do is get refinanced."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its current form, Mrs. Gavini's mortgage is valuable to the investors in CWABS 2006-7, given its interest rate and steady repayment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the lingo of the mortgage-bond industry, her high-rate loan is "trapped" in the CWABS 2006-7 bond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As various other loans have fallen out of the bond—through foreclosures, sales of the homes and other routes—the Countrywide bond has become more and more concentrated with loans such as Mrs. Gavini's that are current, enhancing its value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases, the loans in it are current because of government munificence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carolyn Culbreth, the owner of a single-story house near Interstate 95 in the eastern Florida city of Palm Coast, hasn't made a mortgage payment on her own since March 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unemployed through all of last year, the 62-year-old now earns $9 an hour working at home for a call center offering billing and other customer service for cable, Internet and phone companies. She recently took in her son and grandson to live with her.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> denied her latest request for a modification of a mortgage that Countrywide made. The reason it gave was that the investors in her mortgage—the holders of CWABS 2006-7—didn't participate in a modification program designed to help unemployed homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a government program has covered the payments Ms. Culbreth missed and her most recent ones. The state of Florida has done so through a "Hardest Hit Fund" that funnels federal money to strapped homeowners. The subsidy is technically a loan, but it will be forgiven if Ms. Culbreth stays in the house for 5½ years after the arrival of her last subsidy payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That day has come. The program has a maximum benefit, which Ms. Culbreth just hit. She doesn't know how she will be able to afford her $1,451 monthly payment without the subsidy. "I may end up having to walk out of this house,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Years of modification attempts and state subsidies don't appear to have changed a basic fact of Ms. Culbreth's homeownership, which is that she can't afford the mortgage Countrywide gave her. Today, she owes more than when she first took out the loan in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked about Ms. Culbreth, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>'s spokeswoman said now that she is employed, the bank plans to contact her to see if it can help modify her mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rising value of the CWABS 2006-7 has benefited not just from its growing concentration of borrowers current on their mortgages but also from the courtroom success of investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June 2011, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> agreed to pay $8.5 billion to settle investor claims that Countrywide had lent to people who couldn't afford to repay, leading to losses on CWABS 2006-7 and 529 other Countrywide mortgage bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The settlement still isn't final. Some investors say it covered only a fraction of the losses on the bonds. Nonetheless, traders said it has lifted the value of assets such as CWABS 2006-7.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the investors who suffered losses on Countrywide bonds early on, and were part of the lawsuit, spotted opportunity later and quickly got aboard again. Among them giant money managers <span class="companylink">BlackRock Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Pacific Investment Management Co</span>., the <span class="companylink">Allianz SE</span> unit known as Pimco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In mid-2011, as BlackRock and 21 other investors were hammering out their settlement with Countrywide, a BlackRock fund started purchasing a senior slice of the bond, according to research firm <span class="companylink">Morningstar Inc</span>. By early 2012, after this piece of the bond had risen 44% in value, BlackRock had sold this stake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for Pimco, it poured $31 million into CWABS 2006-7 throughout 2012, a period during which the price increased 11%, and still held the investment as of March, according to Morningstar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Pimco bond fund that holds part of CWABS 2006-7, Pimco Income A, is in the top 6% of funds in its category over the past five years, according to Morningstar. "Its mortgage stake has been on fire,'' a Morningstar analyst wrote in late 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CWABS 2006-7 has created opportunities beyond big investment firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Iznurov, the native of Russia, spent months sniffing around in Florida for a low-price house. A Muslim, he said he came to the U.S. from Russia in 2005 to escape religious tensions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He finally found the right property last year in Jacksonville, Fla., a modest ranch house in a development called Summer Trees, which offered him a chance to relocate his wife and two rambunctious children from a cramped apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loan on the house, part of CWABS 2006-7, was both delinquent and underwater. The loan servicer, or firm that collects mortgage payments, agreed to let the homeowner do a short sale—a sale for less than the sum owed that is a way to avoid foreclosure and move on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bond investors swallowed a loss on the original $121,600 loan as Mr. Iznurov bought the house for $77,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The previous owner had a 9%-interest subprime loan. Mr. Iznurov's mortgage isn't subprime. He has a loan insured by the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span> with an interest rate of 3.65%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That's the market," Mr. Iznurov says. "Somebody lose, somebody win."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mudd, the water-filter salesman, fears he could be about to lose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a rainy afternoon this summer, he sat in his living room in Port Charlotte with the shades drawn and the lights off. A stack of bank documents 13 inches tall was on his kitchen table.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The year after being turned down for a loan modification, Mr. Mudd again applied for a modification in February 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year of back and forth followed. He said he would fax his pay stubs and tax returns, and the bank would tell him they were outdated and ask him to send the documents again. "They would do this over and over and over again,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> spokeswoman said that Mr. Mudd's experience was "unusual." She added that since then, "we've made significant improvement in our processes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February 2011, the bank agreed to lower Mr. Mudd's interest rate to 7.3% from 8.37%. But as often happens with modifications, the change didn't lower his monthly payment. Because the mortgage revision had to cover delinquent past payments, it produced, despite a lower interest rate, a higher monthly bill, $1,323.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his case, the modification was later canceled when Mr. Mudd didn't keep up with the new, higher payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> spokeswoman said, "We've been helping Mr. Mudd since 2008, offering him multiple modifications to help him keep his house."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, the trustee for the investors of CWABS 2006-7 filed notice in court seeking to foreclose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On May 29, Mr. Mudd received two more letters from <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>. One suggested he consider a short sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other offered him "a Trial Period Plan." This variety of modification would again increase his monthly payment, to $1,688. Making three straight payments would qualify Mr. Mudd for a permanent modification, though the bank hasn't disclosed the exact terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He made one of the $1,688 payments in July, but didn't make the August payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mudd said a housing counselor has suggested that he walk away from the house and find an affordable rental in the area. He hasn't. But, he said, "I am not sure it is worth the fight anymore."</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Chinese Developer SZITIC Plans Hong Kong IPO; Offering May Be Held as Early as Fourth Quarter</span>
</div><div class="author">Yvonne Lee </div><div>436 words</div><div>9 September 2013</div><div>21:36</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HONG KONG—Chinese shopping mall developer SZITIC Commercial Property Co. plans to hold an initial public offering in Hong Kong that could raise as much as US$1 billion, people familiar with the matter said Tuesday, following recent gains in developers' share prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SZITIC joins a growing list of companies planning or conducting big IPOs in Hong Kong, once the world's top IPO venue. Chinese milk producer China Huishan Dairy Holdings Co. began taking orders on Tuesday for an offering expected to raise up to US$1.3 billion, which would make it the city's largest IPO in four months. Meanwhile, <span class="companylink">China Cinda Asset Management Co</span>., which buys bad loans from the country's banks, is planning a US$2 billion IPO later this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SZITIC hasn't decided when it would hold the IPO, which could come as soon as the fourth quarter of this year, but it hopes to complete it no later than the first quarter of next year, the people said. It has appointed <span class="companylink">China International Capital Corp Ltd</span>. and <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co</span>. to handle its listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Founded in 2003 in Shenzhen, SZITIC has developed 10 shopping malls in cities including Beijing, Hangzhou, and Suzhou, according to its website. In May, it sold a 49% stake in two of its malls to U.S. private-equity firm <span class="companylink">Carlyle Group</span> as part of a strategic partnership between the two companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The IPO plan comes as Chinese property developers' stocks are again gaining favor among investors as real-estate prices rise and home sales on the mainland surge. As of Friday, shares in the 10 largest Hong Kong-listed Chinese property developers had gained more than 20% on average since late June, far outpacing the MSCI Asia ex-Japan index, an Asia-wide equity benchmark that had gained 8% during the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing sales in China this year were up 40% through July from the same period a year earlier, according to the <span class="companylink">National Bureau of Statistics</span>. In August, prices rose 8.6% from a year earlier, and surged in major cities, according to data provider China Real Estate Index System.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aiming to rein in runaway housing prices, China's central government began tightening property controls since 2010, but took a more relaxed approach beginning this year as economic growth weakened, leading sales and prices to rebound in many cities.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Japan is in a celebratory mood. While the public is euphoric at winning the race to host the 2020 Olympic Games, investors are toasting figures showing brisk economic growth. But to ensure a true national revival, Japan's leaders must seize this moment to push forward with difficult reforms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economic impact of the Tokyo Olympics will be slight. Recent Games, from Athens to London, illustrate that building stadiums and other facilities fails to yield lasting benefits. Nomura estimates that total Olympic construction spending over the next eight years will amount to just 0.3% of last year's gross domestic product.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the psychological impact could be significant. Winning the Games has added to a resurgence of optimism as the economy escapes from decades of stagnation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data released Monday showed that the economic rebound is still going strong. Japan raised its estimate of second-quarter GDP growth to an annualized rate of 3.8%, from a previous reading of 2.6%. And with business confidence on the rise, the economy is showing all-round strength. Private nonresidential investment, which had been a weak spot, is estimated to have risen 1.3% in the second quarter. Earlier figures showed it declining by 0.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Credit goes to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his handpicked central bank governor, who has shaken off deflation and sluggish growth with aggressive money printing. But quantitative easing, like Olympic construction spending, can only stimulate in the short term. Fundamental issues such as a shrinking population, stifling overregulation, and the huge national debt still limit Japan's growth potential.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So it is critical for Mr. Abe to advance politically unpalatable reforms that would build a foundation for long-term growth. A package of measures unveiled before July's parliamentary elections dodged contentious issues like boosting immigration and giving companies more flexibility to dismiss workers. Mr. Abe should revisit those agenda items now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prime minister has also been dithering over a plan to raise sales taxes, though his own ministers say it is necessary to shore up confidence in public finances. Monday's GDP figures give him no excuse to put off the hike.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having built up huge public goodwill, and with a key election behind him, this is Mr. Abe's moment — and Japan's. There may not be a similar chance for the country to change course for a better future.</p>

</div><div class="author">James Glynn </div><div>838 words</div><div>9 September 2013</div><div>08:37</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SYDNEY—The number of home loans approved in Australia continued to rise, cementing evidence that record low interest rates are strengthening the housing market, even as the rest of the economy sags from a slowing mining boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Approvals for the purchase of owner-occupied homes rose a seasonally adjusted 2.4% in July from a month earlier, official figures Monday showed. It was the sixth straight monthly gain. Approvals to buy new homes rose 5.9%, while lending for already-built houses rose 2.7% from the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In further evidence of rising housing demand, a separate government report last week showed an 11% surge in homebuilding permits issued in July, twice the level expected by economists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home loans have risen steadily this year, creating a bright spot in an otherwise darkening economic outlook. Still, indicators such as consumer confidence have been patchy, leading to concern the current low rate setting isn't having a broad enough effect, as the central bank seeks to make the economy less dependent on mining.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think it is generally accepted that housing alone can't carry the economy through the transition from mining," said Matthew Hassan, a senior economist at <span class="companylink">Westpac</span>. "It has to be part of maintaining growth, but we really do need to see non-mining sectors also move ahead to ensure a reasonably smooth transition."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest data add to evidence elsewhere that property markets are recovering. In both Sydney and Melbourne, sales of houses at auctions have risen to record levels in recent months, according to research firm Australian Property Monitors. Government figures show house prices jumped at the fastest pace in three years in the second quarter, compared with a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Australia's central bank</span> has cut rates eight times since November 2011 in a bid to revive activity in weaker parts of the economy, including retail and housing construction, as a decadelong resources boom slows and threatens to boost unemployment. The latest cut in August took the benchmark cash rate to a fresh record low 2.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation's newly elected prime minister, Tony Abbott, said at the weekend that his conservative administration would move quickly to boost the slowing economy by cutting taxes and building new infrastructure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loan approvals data signal whether consumer demand for debt is increasing, making it a useful measure of sentiment at a time when many Australians still prefer to save their money amid continuing anxiety over the state of the global and local economy. Along with retail, housing is among the most rate-sensitive sectors, and a recovery in both have led previous expansions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrew Wilson, chief economist at Australian Property Monitors, said very low interest rates were "jet propelling markets and buyer activity," although he added that "we're not talking boom conditions yet."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Australia avoided the kind of housing crash that consumed the U.S. in 2008 following the implosion of so-called subprime mortgages. Now, the record low rates have led some experts to warn a housing bubble may be forming here that risks destabilizing an already weakening economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday's loan data fueled concern that gains are being driven by speculative investors rather than signaling underlying strength in the housing market, after new loans to investors surged almost 26% in July from a year earlier, the steepest gain since 2007. The value of loans to owner occupiers rose by a much smaller 13%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, parts of the economy outside of housing remain sluggish. Separate data Monday showed job adverts fell 19% in August from a year earlier, capping a sixth consecutive monthly decline. The nongovernment survey is hovering near lows reached during the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retail sales grew at their weakest pace in half a century in the year through June, while manufacturing has contracted for the past 26 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Job ads and other economic indicators suggest little evidence of a pickup in business confidence and hiring intentions, consistent with the unemployment rate continuing to trend modestly higher in the near term," said Ivan Colhoun, chief Australian economist at <span class="companylink">Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group</span>, which carried out the job ads survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Official employment figures for August are due Thursday. The jobless rate in July was 5.7%, still low by global standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Australia's $1.5 trillion economy has expanded for more than two decades, China's slowing economy has driven down commodity prices in recent months, prompting mining companies to shed staff and shutter mines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central bank recently lowered its growth forecast for this year and toned down its job outlook, citing a faster-than-expected cooling in mining investment. The economy expanded by 2.6% in the second quarter compared with a year earlier, data last week showed, much slower than quarterly growth rates as high as 4% last year.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON—Output from British factories stagnated in July and exports to countries outside the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> fell at the fastest rate in over four years, official data showed Friday, in contrast to the recent slew of surveys pointing to strong economic growth in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Office for National Statistics</span> said the trade deficit on goods was £9.9 billion ($15.45 billion) in July, considerably wider than June's deficit of £8.2 billion and the biggest trade gap in nine months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Driving the widening deficit was a fall in exports of goods to countries outside the EU, which dropped £2.2 billion, or 15.8%, to £11.8 billion in July compared with June—the biggest percentage fall since January 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ONS also released production data, which showed overall industrial production was flat in July compared with June, and was 1.6% lower on an annual basis. Manufacturing alone rose 0.2% in July from June, and was 0.7% weaker compared with the corresponding period a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday's weaker-than-expected data contrast sharply with surveys of purchasing managers released earlier this week that showed the manufacturing, construction and services sectors performing strongly in the third quarter. In addition, the <span class="companylink">Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development</span> said Tuesday it expects economic growth in the U.K. to outpace expansion in the U.S., Germany, France and Japan in the second half of 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said that while Friday's data tempered the recent flow of strong figures, it didn't fundamentally alter the improving economic trajectory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Over recent weeks we have become accustomed to upbeat, consensus beating, economic out turns on the U.K. economy," said Victoria Clarke, an economist at Investec. "Today's releases didn't quite match the recent mood, but do not deflect from our view of building recovery momentum."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The disappointing industrial production and trade figures could be a relief for the <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span> if it reverses expectations that interest rates could rise, according to <span class="companylink">HSBC</span> economist John Zhu.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The BOE has found it hard to convince investors that it can stick to its pledge to keep its benchmark rate at a record low 0.5% until unemployment, currently 7.8%, hits 7%, a threshold it doesn't think will be crossed until 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rate pledge, dubbed "forward guidance," is aimed at encouraging greater spending and investment by households and businesses but markets are betting the BOE will raise rates much sooner, perhaps in 2015, as evidence mounts that an economic recovery in the U.K. is rapidly gaining strength.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the pledge does appear to be getting through to ordinary Britons, with a survey published Friday from the central bank showing the percentage of Britons expecting interest rates to rise within a year fell in August to its lowest level since 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The BOE said 29% of 2,050 Britons quizzed in August expected borrowing costs to rise within the next 12 months, down from 34% in May. That's the smallest proportion expecting a rate rise since November 2008. There have only been three occasions since the survey started in 1999 when fewer people thought rates were due to rise within a year, the BOE said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another survey released Friday showed U.K. house prices rose for a seventh straight month in August, suggesting government programs continue to support demand and adding to concerns a bubble could emerge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest house price survey from U.K. lender Halifax showed house prices in August rose 0.4% from July and were 5.4% higher than a year earlier, the biggest annual increase since June 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government's Funding for Lending scheme has increased availability and lowered the cost of mortgages, while Help-to-Buy offers first-time buyers of newly built homes a government loan to help cover the typical 25% deposit required to secure a cheaper mortgage deal. But as potential home-buyers' ability to purchase a home has improved, a lack of new homes has pushed prices higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span>, the <span class="companylink">Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development</span>, and U.K. Business Secretary Vince Cable have warned that a lack of new properties alongside support for home-buyers raises the risk of a bubble forming that could burst if house prices rise beyond the reach of potential home-buyers.</p>

</div><div class="author">Christopher Bjork  </div><div>581 words</div><div>4 September 2013</div><div>11:37</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MADRID—<span class="companylink">TPG Inc</span>. is set to acquire a 51% stake in the real-estate servicing arm of Spanish financial institution La Caixa for €189 million ($249 million), marking the U.S. investment company's first foray into Spain's ailing property sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to people familiar with the sale, the Barcelona bank selected the offer from the Texas-based buyout firm over a rival bid by <span class="companylink">Bridgepoint Capital Ltd</span>. The transaction was at an advanced stage Wednesday, pending regulatory approvals and settlement of some contractual details, these people said. A TPG spokesman in London had no immediate comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal would make <span class="companylink">Servihabitat Gestión Inmobiliaria</span> the biggest of several Spanish property-servicing units to be sold in recent months to U.S. investors. Earlier this week, <span class="companylink">Cerberus Capital Management</span> agreed to buy the servicing unit of Bankia SA. Kennedy-Wilson Holdings Inc. and <span class="companylink">Centerbridge Partners LP</span> have made similar deals with Spanish banks over the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The newfound interest by U.S. investors in Spanish assets comes after a 35% slide in Spain's housing prices over the nearly six years since a housing bubble burst. Investors are flocking to Spain looking for bargains, in the hope that property prices are close to bottoming out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors such as TPG and Cerberus can use servicing companies to manage assets they later hope to buy. The boom and bust of Spain's property market left in its wake vast numbers of unsold homes along the Mediterranean coast that have attracted such investors in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owning a servicer has another advantage, experts say: It becomes a real-time barometer of activity and price levels, because of the work these companies do collecting rent, brokering sales and maintaining assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It allows investors see what's going on in the market and have a tool to manage their assets," said Miguel Hernández López, a real estate professor at Madrid's IE Business School. For someone expanding in property "it makes sense to own these businesses."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal is a first for TPG in Spain. The buyout firm, which has $55.3 billion in capital under management, made an unsuccessful joint bid six years ago with <span class="companylink">British Airways PLC</span> to acquire Spain's flagship airline <span class="companylink">Iberia Líneas Aereas de España SA</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For La Caixa, which will retain 49% of Servihabitat, teaming up with TPG would unlock capital gains as it navigates the fifth year of Spain's economic crisis. The financial group, the third-largest in Spain by assets and the largest by retail branches, is among half a dozen lenders to emerge from the crisis without needing government aid. But it has sold assets to bolster its capital cushion after taking over several weak lenders over the past two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> advised La Caixa on the sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TPG also brings know-how from the real-estate industry to Servihabitat. TPG has committed more than $2 billion in equity on 11 real-estate related investments since 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of the deal, La Caixa has agreed to continue to use Servihabitat for all its servicing needs for 10 years, said the people familiar with the sale. Servihabitat, which has 250 employees, services around 130,000 properties and brokers house sales and rentals valued at roughly €3 billion a year.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STOCKHOLM -- Few projects are as important to the future of Stockholm's constrained housing market as the plan to reinvent the Royal Seaport.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long an industrial and transportation hub with an oil depot, container port and ferry terminal, developers have been working to relocate much of the seaport's activity to make room for thousands of new homes and offices in proximity to the water and city center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There should be no shortage of interest. Stockholm's job opportunities and a desirable city center has made the Swedish capital the second-fastest-rising city in Europe, behind Oslo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the pace of transformation at the seaport shows why Stockholm's supply of housing seems to be shrinking by the day. The seaport project has been under way a dozen years and eventually is slated to include 12,000 new apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But because of the red tape and delays -- over such issues as noise pollution and whether the sanctity of a nearby park will be threatened -- only 600 units have been built. Planners say the project won't be completed until 2030.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is a lot of waiting," said Staffan Lorentz, the project manager for Stockholm Royal Seaport, the municipal organization running the project. "Everything is rejected by someone."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite enormous demand for new housing, Stockholm's home-building industry is being stifled by regulation. Partly because of rules governing development, Sweden's production costs for new housing, for instance, are the highest in the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> -- and 72% above the average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result is that construction projects limp along, and international developers for the most part are staying on the sidelines. Meanwhile, the country's small industry of developers, builders and investors focus primarily on upscale housing where margins are better, largely ignoring the needs of the middle class.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't think we can develop our business by trying to keep things the way they are," says Peter Wagstrom, chief executive of NCC, Sweden's third-largest construction company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stockholm isn't alone. Concerns about housing shortages are echoed in other European cities, such as London and Berlin, that have fared relatively well during the past years of financial turbulence. The rest of Europe is looking to these cities, in part, to fuel the Continent's recovery, but affordable housing could be a stumbling block.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some investors are benefiting from the imbalance between supply and demand. With rents rising in Germany, for example, stocks in German rental-apartment companies have been seen as an attractive long-term bet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, risk-averse institutional investors are buying rental properties in Sweden, seeking safety in their predictable, if low, returns. Residential properties accounted for 36% of the transaction market in Sweden this year, up from 10% to 20% in the early 2000s, according to estimates by Stockholm-based property consultancy Newsec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But officials and business leaders in cities facing housing shortages recognize their economic growth could be stifled if workforces can't find places to live.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a population in the Stockholm region of over 2.1 million, the county administration board estimates that up to 319,000 homes need to be built by 2030, or more than 17,000 new homes a year. But between 2000 and 2012, only an average of 7,248 new homes a year were completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We cannot provide housing for our young colleagues," says Konstantin Papaxanthis, chief executive of small software developer Primekey. While his company is posting a 20% annual sales growth rate and is hiring, the expanding workforce isn't necessarily enjoying the best Stockholm has to offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company "can't expand the way we would like because of the housing shortage," Mr. Papaxanthis says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stefan Attefall, Sweden's 53-year-old housing minister, says there is no quick fix for the problem. Changing the system isn't politically popular in Sweden, where many citizens view rental-market regulation as a critical part of a social safety net that Sweden and other Nordic countries strive to maintain through high taxes and other measures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The dilemma is how do we achieve consumer protection, security for tenants and a decent society?" Mr. Attefall says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Knowing he won't be able to get the political support needed to do away with the current rent regulation, he is fighting instead to reduce red tape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There also has been small steps taken to loosen regulation, and some analysts believe there may be more to come. "It has become more politically acceptable to talk about less regulated rents," says equity analyst Albin Sandberg at Handelsbanken.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that is little consolation for everyday renters like Therese Larsen, who are increasingly out in the cold. A 27-year-old lawyer working on a temporary contract in downtown Stockholm, Ms. Larsen has been searching for a place close to work for more than a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When you're young and ambitious, you want to live where something's going on -- in the city, of course," says 27-year-old Ms. Larsen. As she waits on a list for a rental apartment, her sister has put her up in her apartment, which is a 30-minute train ride from her office. "At least I don't have to live on the street," she says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration wants to create a mortgage market that is more forgiving to borrowers who lost their homes due to the recession, an effort that could widen the pool of potential homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent rule change lets certain borrowers who have gone through a foreclosure, bankruptcy or other adverse event -- but who have repaired their credit -- become eligible to receive a new mortgage backed by the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span> after waiting as little as one year. Previously, they had to wait at least three years before they could qualify for a new government-backed loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be eligible for the new FHA loans, borrowers must show that their foreclosure or bankruptcy was caused by a job loss or reduction in income that was beyond their control. Borrowers also must prove their incomes have had a "full recovery" and complete housing counseling before getting a new mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate companies in bubble hot spots like Las Vegas and Phoenix already have stepped up marketing campaigns to attract these so-called "boomerang" buyers whose finances have improved after a foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it isn't clear if banks will be eager to offer loans with the new terms at a time when they are facing a wave of lawsuits and investigations related to other government-backed loans. The FHA already offers among the most flexible lending standards today, requiring down payments of just 3.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's difficult to see how lenders would even consider doing mortgages with higher risk" in the current environment, said David Stevens, the chief executive of the Mortgage Bankers Association, who served as the FHA's commissioner from 2009 to 2011. Lenders aren't going to expand credit "while you're suing them and threatening them over minor errors."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The policy change reflects broader concerns among administration officials and federal regulators that the mortgage-credit pendulum has swung too far to the restrictive side from the days of lax lending rules that fueled the bubble. Some economists say too-strict credit standards are shutting out some creditworthy borrowers and holding back economic growth. Low participation in the recovery by young buyers "absolutely is a problem, and I'm not exactly an 'easy credit' guy," said Thomas Lawler, a housing economist in Leesburg, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new rules, which expire in three years, also apply to former homeowners who completed a short sale, where a bank approves the sale for less than the amount owed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That could help potential buyers like Candy Alvarado, who sold a condominium in Norwalk, Calif., for $108,000 three years ago, leaving her bank with a $168,000 loss. The 31-year-old schoolteacher, who used a no-money-down mortgage, said it didn't make sense to keep the condo after home values dropped and her work hours were cut during the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Alvarado and her husband began looking for a home for around $400,000 in April and they are preapproved for an FHA-backed loan. "We've been saving, and we want to make sure we have a home where we can build equity," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shaun Donovan, the secretary for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which runs the FHA, played down potential criticism that the agency might invite a return to risky lending practices. "What we are talking about is getting back to responsible, plain-vanilla lending," he said in an interview. "We believe these are low-risk loans that can be made safely."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the four years ended last September, some 3.9 million homes had been lost to foreclosure. About 1 million borrowers who went through foreclosure during the crisis have already waited the required three years to be eligible for an FHA-backed mortgage, according to estimates from <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the new rules could help some buyers, many former homeowners will need more time to repair their credit, said Aviva Lomeli, a real-estate agent with Redfin who represents Ms. Alvarado. "You don't necessarily start recovering one day after you finish a short sale," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government -- through mortgage-finance firms <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> or federal agencies -- has guaranteed as many as nine in 10 new loans in recent years. But over the past four years, banks have had to buy back tens of billions of defaulted loans as Fannie, Freddie and the FHA faced mounting losses. Because of uncertainties about these "put-backs," lenders have imposed more-conservative standards than what the federal entities require.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FHA says it has a separate effort under way to provide greater clarity about when banks could face put-backs, following on the work of the regulator for Fannie and Freddie last year. Lenders say those changes haven't been specific enough to change their lending posture.</p>

</div><div class="author">Esther Fung  </div><div>1183 words</div><div>2 September 2013</div><div>15:22</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pent-up demand driving China's housing prices ever higher was on full view at the launch of the manicured Shanyucheng apartment complex in Beijing's outermost suburbs. A shouting match flared up when 500 people came to sign up to buy 200 units on Saturday and the latecomers realized they had little chance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices nationwide climbed 8.6% year-over-year in August and soared in major cities, according to data provider <span class="companylink">China Real Estate</span> Index System on Monday. That continues a period of rising prices beginning late last year and sustaining momentum as Beijing began relaxing controls on the property market to boost growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the rising prices are doing little to boost construction—and so haven't boosted the wider economy or helped the countries that feed off the Chinese construction industry as much as many had hoped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reason: developers are sitting on a large amount of unsold inventory. With builders preferring to pare down their existing supply rather than take on new projects, housing starts are returning to life only sluggishly—up 7.1% in the first seven months of the year, according to the government. Sales rose 27.1% to 547.3 million square meters over the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The leaden pace of new building in China has been felt around the world. China's overall economic growth is testing a 23-year low. Demand for steel and cement—mainstays of the industrial economy—remains lackluster. Commodity exports from Australia to Brazil have taken a hit. Iron major <span class="companylink">Rio Tinto</span> has cut 2,200 jobs since mid-2012, partly because of disappointing Chinese demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in house prices also threatens to undo the government policy goal of keeping housing affordable and bringing the dream of homeownership to China's expanding middle class. At the Shanyucheng launch on Saturday, would-be buyers jostled to register for the units, which cost around 3 million yuan ($486,000) each and are far from the city center, even as they worried whether the highflying prices may plummet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think about it all the time," said Zhen Heshan, a lifelong Beijing resident who works at a school and was buying a place for his soon-to-be married son. "It's my biggest worry."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices are up 22.5% year-over-year in Beijing, CREIS said. In Guangzhou, the rate is 24.2%. Other cities are seeing more modest increases, with prices in Shanghai up 7.7%</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's leaders find themselves caught between a desire to moderate housing prices and a need to bolster growth. The government says it wants to maintain the limits on purchases of second homes and other controls imposed in a swathe of cities since 2010 to cool the market. The government has said it would introduce a capital-gains tax intended to hit speculators who flip homes, and is considering a nationwide rollout of a property tax being tested in Shanghai and Chongqing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But behind the scenes, credit conditions and regulations in many cities have been relaxed as town halls attempt to pump up construction to support growth and tax revenue. Loans to home buyers surged in the second quarter, with mortgage lending up 21.1% year-over-year. That has driven a boom in sales, prices and profits for real-estate developers as the demand pent-up since 2010 floods into the market. China Overseas Land &amp; Investment—the nation's second-largest developer and a bellwether for the sector—saw profits up 31.6% in the first half of the year. Land sales by local governments, a crucial source of revenue, are up strongly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of new building, however, is anemic. "The pickup in construction starts lagged behind the recovery in housing sales early this year," said Rosealea Yao, an analyst at GK Dragonomics. "Property developers were busy selling off their inventory in the first half."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The backlog in unsold housing is formidable. At the end of 2012, China had more than 4 billion square meters of residential property under construction, enough to satisfy demand for more than four years without a single new project started. The bloated inventory is the result of China's last go-round with slowing growth, in 2009. To recharge the economy, Beijing unleashed bank lending and loosened its controls on the property sector. Sales and construction soared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, even as national prices rise, some developers are offering steep discounts to shift unsold homes. At Bellagio Villas, a luxury development on the outskirts of Shanghai, only a dozen of the 146 Italian-style homes have been sold in the year since its launch. The developer, Happy Home Land Ltd., has cut prices by 25%, and is offering any buyer a free Land Rover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Happy Home Land said current sales are within expectations and would improve: "September and October will be a strong period for us."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other developers are adopting a cautious approach. "This year we didn't push out as many new projects as we'd like to," said Yang Duo, head of investor relations at <span class="companylink">Yuzhou Properties</span>, based in the port city of Xiamen. He cited high inventory and a lack of attractive land plots for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand at some projects remains hot, but nationwide sales are decelerating, a sign the recent increase may be sputtering. "Demand is much lower than before", said Yuan Yanli, manager of Haodaijin Real Estate, a small agency in Beijing, "I don't think it's going to recover."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of income growth—a key driver of demand for higher quality housing—has slowed to 6.5% in the first half of 2013 from an average of 9.4% from 2007-2012. While urbanization continues at a rapid pace, with 21 million added to China's city population in 2012, the majority of new arrivals are too poor to afford a new home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many Chinese already have substantial funds plowed into domestic property. Some 49 million own two or more homes, according to a recent survey by <span class="companylink">Peking University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many are looking to diversify. "I've looked at homes in Texas," said Terry Li, an executive at a technology firm, saying returns look more attractive than in her native Shanghai, where she owns an apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of China's developers are also looking at projects overseas, rather than accelerating building at home. Among them is <span class="companylink">China Vanke</span>, the nation's biggest builder, which is teaming up with U.S. developer Tishman Speyer on a high-end condominium in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government has also sent mixed signals to the market, continuing to talk about controls and raising the prospect of moves to bring prices more in line with income. In major cities such as Beijing, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, "further price increases will affect affordability, which in turn could invite more government measures to cool the sector down," said <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> analyst Kaven Tsang.</p>

</div><div class="author">Jason Douglas </div><div>594 words</div><div>30 August 2013</div><div>05:30</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON—British consumer confidence perked up in July and house prices rose, adding to evidence the U.K. economy is picking up steam. But some economists caution the recovery looks dangerously dependent on cheap credit and warn government policies risk inflating a potentially destabilizing housing bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A flurry of economic reports Friday suggested growth continued over the summer after the U.K. economy expanded at an annualized rate of 2.9% in the second quarter, buoyed by exports and consumer spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A monthly gauge of consumer confidence published by market-research firm GfK hit a high of nearly four years in August, as Britons responded to the steady flow of data pointing to an economic revival.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, mortgage lender <span class="companylink">Nationwide Building Society</span> said house prices in the U.K. rose 0.6% on average between July and August to stand 3.5% higher than a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bank England said approvals for new home loans hit 60,624 in July, the highest monthly total in more than five years. Britons also borrowed more on credit cards in July to fund spending, while interest rates for popular types of home loans hit new lows. Total consumer lending, net of repayments, rose by £1.33 billion ($2.06 billion), the BOE said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Cheaper credit has been doing wonders for housing, and is fueling Britain's consumer-led recovery," said Rob Wood, chief U.K. economist at <span class="companylink">Berenberg Bank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a reflection of growing optimism, the <span class="companylink">British Chambers of Commerce</span> on Friday raised its growth forecasts for the U.K. economy, saying it expects an expansion of 1.3% in 2013, a big uplift to its previous forecast for just 0.9% growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it warned Britain's economic recovery isn't yet secure, citing risks to growth from the potential for a renewed flare-up of the euro-zone debt crisis, a possible slowdown in China's economy and escalating tensions in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have had false dawns in recent years and although this upturn appears to be on stronger ground, we must be aware that complacency could lead to setbacks," said BCC director-general John Longworth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another worry for many economists is whether cheap credit and a surging housing market are storing up problems for the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics say a government initiative called Help to Buy risks inflating a property bubble. The program is designed to revive the U.K.'s moribund housing market by offering taxpayer-backed loans to would-be home buyers struggling to find enough cash for a down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span> and the <span class="companylink">Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development</span> have both warned surging demand for homes needs to be met with more supply to prevent prices spiraling out of control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, economists say the housing market is some way from the exuberance it displayed in the years running up to recession in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Approvals for home loans are still roughly 40% lower each month than they were in the decade before the downturn, said Samuel Tombs, U.K. economist at Capital Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BOE data Friday showed business lending remained subdued in July, particularly for smaller firms, denting hopes for a much-needed revival in investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The BOE this week relaxed rules requiring lenders to hold large emergency pools of salable assets in an effort to free up more cash to finance new lending.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sanette Tanaka   </div><div>651 words</div><div>30 August 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M10</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">College football kicked off Thursday, the official start of face-painting and foam-finger season on U.S. campuses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A preseason poll released by the Associated Press listed the early favorites to win: Alabama, Ohio State, Oregon, Stanford and Georgia. But Spread Sheet wondered: Which college towns of these top-ranked teams perform the best in terms of real estate?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the answer, real-estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> analyzed median home prices in the top five football cities as of Aug. 15. The findings put two schools at the top of the real-estate rankings: Tuscaloosa, Ala., home of No. 1-ranked Crimson Tide, had the highest year-to-year increase in listing price, rising 20%. Eugene, Ore., with the No. 3-ranked Ducks, boasts the highest median listing price at $260,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taken as a whole, the listing prices of the top cities are modest, says Jed Kolko, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>. "Universities that are big enough to support a top-ranked football team are rarely located in expensive areas," he says. "Many big state universities were originally focused on agricultural and technical education, and therefore were located outside the state's biggest city."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Donna Petty, associate broker with Hamner Real Estate, says Tuscaloosa's real-estate market has traditionally been fairly stable, held up in part by big employers like the <span class="companylink">University of Alabama</span> and divisions of Mercedes-Benz U.S. International and <span class="companylink">Nucor</span> Steel. "We really haven't had depreciation like in most areas. It leveled out. Now, it is starting to go up," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Tuscaloosa, the price-per-square-foot increased a modest 5.3% over the past year, suggesting that the higher prices are due to the average home for sale getting bigger, Mr. Kolko says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low property taxes and relatively inexpensive prices make Tuscaloosa attractive, Ms. Petty adds. "We're doing a lot of vacation homes, second homes and game-day homes -- a condo or small home for owners to attend football games or other athletic events," she says. "We have a lot of baby boomers who went to the university, loved it and are now moving back."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By and large, football fans aren't the ones spurring growth. "These aren't just football towns, these are university towns. When you look over many decades, the presence of a university is a big driver of economic development" -- and higher prices, Mr. Kolko says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is true in Eugene, Ore., says Brent Cole, a real-estate agent at Re/Max Integrity in the town, where the <span class="companylink">University of Oregon</span> -- not football -- influences prices. Also, residential real-estate around the stadium is relatively sparse. "Game-day traffic is great because no one lives around there but students," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Stanford, Calif., home prices on the campus escalate, but at a below-market rate, particularly in comparison with nearby cities like Palo Alto, where more than 80% of listings are priced at $1 million or more, according to <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>. That is because homes in Stanford, a census-designated place with its own ZIP Code, are available only to qualifying faculty members. Stanford consists primarily of the university, the medical center, on-campus housing, and roughly 750 single-family homes and 250 condos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shari Ornstein, an agent with Alain Pinel Realtors in Palo Alto, has a Stanford listing for a 2,500-square-foot contemporary house that she can sell only to faculty members. If the new owner were to relinquish a faculty position, that person would have two years to vacate the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Ornstein says she put the house on the market a few weeks ago and has received offers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rare, free-standing mansion in Manhattan near <span class="companylink">Columbia University</span> has sold for $14 million, $500,000 above its asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the Upper West Side, the 12,000-square-foot marble townhouse known as the Schinasi Mansion has 12 bedrooms and 11 bathrooms. Architect William Tuthill, who designed Carnegie Hall, built the home in 1909 for Turkish tobacco baron Morris Schinasi. The French Renaissance-style home has Tiffany stained-glass windows, woodworking throughout and a secret tunnel in the basement, says listing agent Tod Mercy of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span> in New York. It includes 3,400 square feet of outdoor space. Mr. Mercy says the home has a lot of character but "needs a lot of work."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mercy says the buyer is a New York businessman who used to live abroad. He says the sellers are the family of Columbia law professor Hans Smit, who bought the property in 1979 for $325,000 and turned it into a single-family residence. Mr. Smit bought the property from <span class="companylink">Columbia University</span>, which had used it as a day-care center. Before Columbia owned the property, the home was the base for the Semple School for Girls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property originally hit the market in 2006 for $31 million; it was reduced to $30 million in 2007, $24.5 million in 2009 and then $20 million in 2011. Later in 2011 it was lowered again, to $15 million, and then to $13.5 million this year. Four months ago, Mr. Mercy says the market began to heat up and several cash offers started coming in. The home closed earlier this month; Mr. Mercy says he didn't let a bidding war break out and that the sellers took the "best and final offer."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mercy says the Smit family put the home on the market because they didn't need the large mansion and weren't up for undertaking a major restoration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael C. Hall, star of the television show "Dexter," has put his compound in Los Angeles on the market for $2.35 million, according to his agent, Josh Myler of the Agency in Beverly Hills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The roughly 4,600-square-foot, Spanish Hacienda-style house was built in 1926 at the end of a cul-de-sac in the Hollywood Hills. It has four bedrooms and five bathrooms. The home has a courtyard garden off the living room as well as a library, media room, separate den off the kitchen, formal dining room and wine room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An additional patio and garden area connect the house to a one-bedroom, one-bathroom guest home. There is also a three-car garage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">British actor Ronald Colman, who was a Hollywood star in the 1930s and 1940s, was among the first owners of the home; the property is known as the Ronald Colman Estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hall bought the home last year for $1.95 million, according to public records. He landscaped much of the 0.3-acre property and renovated some of the interiors as well. Mr. Hall is selling because he recently bought another house in Los Angeles, says Mr. Myler. In a statement through his agent, Mr. Hall praised the estate's red brick floors, old-Hollywood feel and "understated, earthy elegance."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Myler shares the listing with Jeff Kohl, also of the Agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professional figure skater Oksana Baiul has listed her country home in New Hope, Pa., for $875,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The more than 4,000-square-foot Colonial home on 2 acres has five bedrooms, 3½ baths and two fireplaces. There is a two-story foyer, a master bedroom with a sitting room, a formal dining room with gold-colored crown molding and a recently refurbished deck that spans the length of the home. A lower level of 2,048 square feet has a second kitchen and could become an au-pair suite or entertaining space. The third-floor level has a finished loft, and there is another loft over the solarium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property includes bamboo plantings that Ms. Baiul trained to grow as a privacy fence, says listing agent Melanie Stecura of Kurfiss Sotheby's International Realty in Philadelphia. She says Ms. Baiul completely redid the landscaping and gave the home a "cosmetic face-lift" with ornate details. There is also room to build a pool in the backyard, which is bordered by preserved land, Ms. Stecura says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Baiul bought the property in February 2012 for $580,000, according to public records. Ms. Stecura says Ms. Baiul renovated most of the home and decided to list the property now because the market has improved significantly. According to people familiar with Ms. Baiul's career, she is in the final stages of negotiating a live-entertainment production on ice in Las Vegas and Macau, which will launch in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Baiul has become a real-estate investor in recent years, according to people familiar with her business decisions. Last year, she sold her Cliffside Park, N.J., home for $705,000, after putting it on the market for $799,000, according to public records. She bought it for $465,000 in 1998, records show. She also owns properties in the Ukrainian cities of Odessa and Kiev, and in Venice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Stecura shares the listing with Donald Pearson of Kurfiss Sotheby's International Realty in New Hope, Pa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">News Corp. Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch closed Tuesday on the purchase of an estate and winery called Moraga Vineyards in Los Angeles's Bel Air neighborhood for $28.8 million, according to listing agent Jim Kline of Surterre Properties in Newport Beach, Calif. The property was listed for $29.5 million in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 13-acre property has a 7,500-square-foot home with three bedrooms, four bathrooms, an octagonal dressing room and maid's quarters. A guesthouse across a large lawn has two bedrooms and two bathrooms. Hollywood director Victor Fleming, known for "Gone with the Wind" and "The Wizard of Oz," built the homes in the 1930s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property includes vineyards and a 2,300-square-foot winery that produces about 1,500 cases a year. There are also staff quarters, a tasting room and a wine cave, and about $4 million of wine inventory included in the sale, Mr. Kline says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to people familiar with the sale, Mr. Murdoch first learned about the vineyard from an article in The Wall Street Journal. <span class="companylink">News Corp</span> owns <span class="companylink">Dow Jones &amp; Co</span>., publisher of the Journal. Mr. Murdoch is also chairman and CEO of 21st Century Fox, which until June was part of the same company as <span class="companylink">News Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Murdoch went into contract on the property in April and announced the news via <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> in May. The sale has taken several months to finalize because of a long approval process to obtain liquor licenses, Mr. Kline says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Murdoch plans to continue making wine, as sellers Tom and Ruth Jones did, according to people familiar with the sale. "He's excited about learning the winemaking business," Mr. Kline says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kline also co-represented Mr. Murdoch with Delphine Mann of Coldwell Banker Previews International in Beverly Hills. Ms. Mann declined to comment. </p>

</div><div class="author">Esther Fung </div><div>704 words</div><div>29 August 2013</div><div>09:19</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHANGHAI—Major Chinese cities are turning to fresh measures to temper home-buyer enthusiasm amid a renewed surge in housing prices, but analysts say the moves are unlikely to halt the rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beijing's local housing bureau has made it tougher for property developers to presell apartments in recent weeks, giving approvals only to projects that have completed a sufficient amount of construction. Shanghai officials have called for tighter enforcement of restrictions on second and subsequent home purchases, while local media are reporting sharper lending limits in a number of cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, lenders in some areas are scrutinizing mortgages with a closer eye. In late July, China's banking regulator asked banks to step up their supervision of housing loans and called on them to set aside reserves of at least 10% of their mortgage loans. As a result, some banks in Beijing have removed discounts on their mortgage loans for first-home buyers, state media have reported, while smaller banks in the city of Guangzhou have stopped issuing mortgages altogether.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moves come in response to rising prices. Prices of homes included in a survey of 100 Chinese cities climbed 7.9% in July from a year earlier, according to data provided by China Real Estate Index System. China has been trying to tamp down speculative property purchases without smothering demand from those who want to buy their first homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing experts say the moves are unlikely to curb investor demand for property. "As with previous efforts to control supply, this may backfire and prices will still go up," said Lin Bo, an analyst at E-House China, a data provider, about the local Beijing restrictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moves also run counter to what appears to be a broader willingness at the national level to let the property market grow as the economy has slowed. China's growth slowed in the second quarter to 7.5% on a year-over-year basis from 7.7% in the first quarter. Property is a major driver of Chinese economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is still positive sentiment for a boost in housing demand in September and October," said Johnson Hu, an analyst at CIMB Securities, referring to the peak season for home-buying activity in China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early this month, Xu Shaoshi, head of the <span class="companylink">National Development and Reform Commission</span>, the state's economic planner, said that China needs to keep property purchase restrictions in place. But he added that China needs to continue to expand its real-estate market at a stable and healthy pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The efforts appear to be focused on the cities where appreciation has been strongest. Prices of new homes in Beijing rose 14.1% in July from a year earlier, while prices rose 13.7% in Shanghai and 17.2% in Guangzhou, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under new rules introduced in Beijing in recent weeks, builders of apartments exceeding 140 square meters (1,507 square feet) will need to finish half of the construction if the buildings are higher than eight stories before they can presell apartments. With smaller buildings, they must complete basic construction before they can presell units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The idea is to force developers to push out supply more quickly, which in turn could lower housing prices," Mr. Lin said. "But developers that have access to credit may not be in a rush to release lower-priced homes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the Shanghai housing bureau said it would conduct checks until the end of the year to ensure that local authorities are strictly applying restrictions on multiple home purchases. Shanghai has vowed to crack down on the use of fake documents by people hoping to qualify for first-home purchasing privileges, such as lower down-payment requirements and mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Basically the four large banks have stopped giving discounts to first home buyers, but this isn't really affecting housing demand," said Mai Wenzhao, a Guangzhou-based real-estate agent. "Some people are still buying because they are afraid prices will continue to rise if they wait."</p>

</div><div class="author">Jonathan House </div><div>554 words</div><div>28 August 2013</div><div>08:06</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—The number of Americans signing contracts to buy previously owned homes fell in July for the second straight month, the latest sign that higher mortgage rates are starting to drag down the housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Wednesday that its seasonally adjusted index for pending sales of existing homes fell to 109.5 in July, 1.3% lower than the June reading and a steeper decline than the 1% drop forecast by economists. Despite the decline, the index stands 6.7% higher than its level a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Higher mortgage rates are beginning to take some bloom off the buoyancy in the housing market, but are unlikely to derail the recovery," said <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span> economist Millan Mulraine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of the way pending home sales are tallied—at the signing of a contract, rather than at the closing—they provide a more up-to-date reading on housing-market conditions than some other gauges. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage for loans of $417,000 or less rose to 4.80% last week, the Mortgage Bankers Association said Wednesday. That was the highest rate in more than two years and 0.22 percentage point higher than the average rate for late July, reflecting a continued climb in borrowing costs that could restrain home sales further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest rates have been rising since the Federal Reserve signaled earlier this year it could start to rein in its bond-buying program, which is designed to drive down borrowing costs and boost the economic recovery. Rising rates have prompted concerns that the central bank's pullback, which the Fed has indicated could begin as early as next month, could undercut a resurgent housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing, along with consumer spending, has been one of the chief drivers of economic growth this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The declines in June and July pending sales followed a sharp rise in May, as many home buyers moved to lock in lower mortgage rates. "So the broader trend in the data does not look so bad," said <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span> economist Daniel Silver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said high prices and low supplies of homes were also crimping sales in some parts of the country. "More homes clearly need to be built in the West to relieve price pressure, or the region could soon face pronounced affordability problems," Mr. Yun said in a statement. "The modest decline in sales is not yet concerning, and contract activity remains elevated, with the South and Midwest showing no measurable slowdown."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some other recent housing data also has pointed to a softening housing sector. The S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index tracking prices in 20 major U.S. markets rose 12.1% for the year ending in June, down from a gain of 12.2% for the year ending in May. The Commerce Department's reading of new home sales in July showed a 13.4% drop from June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, most economists believe that steady job gains, mortgage rates that are low by historical standards and a shortage of homes available for sale should continue to fuel the housing sector's recovery.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos   </div><div>424 words</div><div>28 August 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rapid ascent of U.S. home prices witnessed earlier this year appears to be slowing, dimmed in part by rising mortgage rates, according to a widely watched home-price index released Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices rose 12.1% for the 12 months ended in June, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index, which tracks prices in 20 major U.S. metro areas. The rate of increase was significantly higher than nearly anyone expected a year ago, but it was down slightly from a gain of 12.2% for the 12 months ended in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say the brisk acceleration in home prices is likely to moderate because housing no longer is as affordable as it was earlier this year. Mortgage rates shot up in June by a full percentage point and stood last week at 4.58% for the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, a two-year high, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising prices also have cooled home-investor purchases in a few markets, such as Phoenix, where an appetite for cheap homes that could be converted to rentals has been strongest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the share of homes selling out of foreclosure has fallen. Because these homes tend to sell at larger discounts, price gains can be overstated during periods in which the share of distressed-property sales is declining. And since the share of those sales has fallen so far that it can't drop much further, there is less headroom for prices to rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, economists aren't expecting home prices to fall because the economy is adding jobs. Some even say a slowdown in home-price inflation would be welcomed because prices had begun to rise out of buyers' reach in more markets, igniting new concerns about bubbles if the large increases continued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This ongoing stabilization is . . . not the end of the world for the housing market," said Stan Humphries, chief economist at house-price website <span class="companylink">Zillow Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, home prices in June were down by 23% from their 2006 peak, compared with a 31% decline a year earlier. Home prices are back to early-2004 levels, though after adjusting for inflation, prices are at levels last seen in late 2001.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of all 20 metro areas, home prices posted the largest year-over-year gain in Las Vegas. While prices were up nearly 25% there from 12 months ago, they were still down 50% from their 2006 peak.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Marshall Heyman </div><div>806 words</div><div>28 August 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A21</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ed Scheetz has become the Chelsea Hotel's new sole owner after buying back five properties from Joseph Chetrit, his partner in King &amp; Grove Hotels who earlier this year purchased the <span class="companylink">Sony</span> building on Madison Avenue for $1.1 billion. Mr. Scheetz, the onetime CEO of <span class="companylink">Morgans Hotel Group</span>, will now retain Ruschmeyer's in Montauk and King &amp; Grove in Williamsburg, but the crown jewel might be the fabled Chelsea, which is currently under renovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Scheetz said he took over the hotel so he and Mr. Chetrit "could each pursue a focused and clear strategy" in their real-estate holdings. He described the renovation project as "challenging."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You're rebuilding it from the inside out," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he now tells people he owns the hotel, "They say, 'Are you crazy?'" Mr. Scheetz said. "Because it's such a challenging project with a high profile. It's an iconic property, one of the most famous hotels in the city. It has one of those famous cultural histories, from Mark Twain to Sid Vicious. Every time I go by, tourists are taking pictures of themselves in front of the door. It's got that kind of pull."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A home for bohemian artists and writers, the Hotel Chelsea since it opened as a luxury co-op in 1884 has housed, among many others, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Andy Warhol, Tennessee Williams, Patti Smith, Joni Mitchell, Dylan Thomas, Bob Dylan, Arthur Miller and Allen Ginsberg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Scheetz said he is taking over the project mid-construction. "It certainly shows its age," he said. "When the building was acquired, it was in a pretty fat state of disrepair. Not in great shape. It's been a substantial project to renovate all the rooms and rebuild while people are living there."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hotel has around 170 rooms and 65 apartments, said Mr. Scheetz. On Tuesday afternoon, he planned to send a letter to the building's tenants association about the changeover and to describe "the significant enhancements to the way the property is managed and the manner in which the restoration is conducted," including lobby usage and removal of construction detritus. In an interview, he added that all of his area hotels have had residents. "It's extraordinarily common, and I've never had problems with the tenants," he explained. "We anticipate there will always be residents. The fact that people live there is part of the history. It's part of the fabric of the hotel."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Scheetz said it was too early to tell when the hotel would reopen for business, and he was waiting to announce any new food and beverage concepts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The big-picture game plan is to restore the Chelsea to the point where it's respectful of its long and storied history, but able to move forward," he said. "I don't want it to be a museum, but a living, breathing fabric of the culture of the city." To that end, he hopes it eventually will be a place where locals can go for dinner, a book signing or an exhibition. "All of those kind of things can happen at the Chelsea," he said. "Part of what I think is important is the community."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Scheetz said it's surprising that many hotel brands don't have emotional connections with consumers, even though hotels are places where you actually spend time and go to sleep. "You might see someone wearing a Four Seasons golf shirt, but you don't tend to see people wearing a T-shirt that says Marriott," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trying to create that emotional connection is important to him, he said. "People have seen everything," he said. "When I started working with Ian Schrager, what he did was novel, but that attracted everybody's attention worldwide. Subsequently, you had a lot of other players who hired fancy designers, fancy chefs and nightlife people, threw it in a box and said, 'This is a nice hotel.'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's Mr. Scheetz's belief that the new customer is looking for a modern, fun experience, but also comfort and value "more so than being shocked by a new design."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We want to bring that sense of gathering and community back to a hotel space," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In particular, the Chelsea appeals to him as a fan of music and literature. But no one, he added, has an actual picture of the hotel at a specific point in time. "It's much more of a romanticized view," Mr. Scheetz said. "You're not restoring this property to 1972. You're restoring the romantic vision of the hotel of the last 100-plus years and making sure it lasts for another 100-plus years."</p>

</div><div class="author">Renée Schultes  </div><div>385 words</div><div>27 August 2013</div><div>07:28</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foxtons is notorious for its ability to push up prices. That has made the London real-estate firm a hit with homeowners. In some London postal codes, Foxtons arranges the sale of one in three properties. It is also a reason for investors considering the company's initial public offering to proceed with care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foxtons announced plans Tuesday to sell £55 million ($85.7 million) of new shares in an IPO, the proceeds of which will be used to pay down debt. Private-equity owner <span class="companylink">BC Partners</span> and Foxtons employees might also sell shares in the offering, which could value the company's equity at around £700 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For <span class="companylink">BC Partners</span>, whose initial investment in 2007 valued Foxtons at as much as £400 million, that is a decent turnaround. It lost control of its investment in 2010 after Foxtons was overwhelmed by debt. The firm bought back a majority stake from its banks a year ago and holds a roughly 80% stake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real-estate firm's timing looks good. The promise of low interest rates and government-backed initiatives aimed at improving the availability of mortgages are pushing up house prices. That should encourage more homeowners to sell. Although average London house prices recently rose above the previous peak in 2007, transaction volumes between 2008 and 2012 were just 55% of the average between 2000 and 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Foxtons is likely to ask investors to pay a premium relative to U.K.-listed peers such as Countrywide, which trades at 17 times forecast 2014 earnings. That may be merited: Forty of Foxtons' 42 branches are in London, where a lack of space and stringent planning rules create a supply shortage, helping to prop up prices. Meanwhile, a lean cost structure means Foxtons generates 31% margins on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, double those at Countrywide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A top-drawer valuation, however, also would rest on Foxtons' growth plans, which look ambitious. The real-estate firm plans to open between five and 10 new branches a year through 2018. At the top end, that implies a more than doubling of its network into London's crowded market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like a pied-a-terre in the capital, Foxtons has appealing qualities. But investors shouldn't lose their heads.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">More Young Adults Live With Parents</span>
</div><div class="author">Neil Shah </div><div>540 words</div><div>27 August 2013</div><div>19:21</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The share of young adults living with their parents edged up last year despite improvements in the economy—a sign that the effects of the recession are lingering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a report on the status of families, the Census Bureau on Tuesday said 13.6% of Americans ages 25 to 34 were living with their parents in 2012, up slightly from 13.4% in 2011. Though the trend began before the recession, it accelerated sharply during the downturn. In the early 2000s, about 10% of people in this age group lived at home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures are the latest evidence of the recession's continuing impact on young Americans, who are finding it harder to land jobs and take on the costs of setting up their own homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vivien Tsuong, 28, has a job as a marketing specialist, but is living at home in San Gabriel, Calif., to save money. In 2010, after returning from Japan, where she taught English for two years, Ms. Tsuong struggled for a year to find work. After landing a position in 2012, she moved into her current job at a company that sells computer and Internet products this spring. Now that she is stable professionally, she wants to build savings, just in case she encounters more job turbulence, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Tsuong said many of her friends are spending $700 or $800 a month on rent. "I can move out if I really wanted to, but given the situation with rent and gas, I feel like I can save more living at home," she said. "If you can save now, you're sort of investing in your future."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demographers say joblessness during the recession and in its aftermath has fueled the trend of young adults living at home. The percentage of 25-to-34-year-olds living with parents climbed from 10.6% early in the 2000s to 11.8% in 2007, when the recession officially began. But after that the figure jumped sharply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Fry, an economist at Pew Research Center, said the rising share of young adults at home reflects changing attitudes about the phenomenon as well as economic pressures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent surveys by Pew found over 60% of people ages 18 to 34 knew someone who had moved back in with their parents because of the economy, he said, and that four of five people ages 25 to 34 who were living with their parents were satisfied with the arrangement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That may suggest there is less stigma attached to living at home, said Mr. Fry. "Living with your parents may not be what it once was," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other trends also are playing a role: Young adults are marrying later, putting off having children and finding it harder to establish stable careers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest findings have important implications for the nation's housing market and broader recovery, since they suggest fewer young Americans are buying houses, furniture and appliances—purchases that fuel much of the country's economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Americans are spending much more than they did during the throes of the recession, overall consumption growth has remained much weaker than in past recoveries.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese stocks led Asia higher, with Shanghai companies at the forefront, while the rest of Asia moved higher after weak housing data from the U.S. tempered expectations that the Federal Reserve will be quick to withdraw its bond-buying program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks in China advanced Monday, with the Shanghai Composite jumping 1.9% to 2096.47 as the market continued to be boosted by last week's approval of a free trade zone in Shanghai. Companies in the city continued to rise on the news: Shanghai International Port (Group) Co. surged 10% and Shanghai Lujiazui Finance &amp; Trade Development Corp. shot up 10%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 0.7% to 22005.32, with shares reacting to earnings reports from some of China's largest companies, including one of the country's biggest banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">China Construction Bank</span> rose 0.7% after reporting that its net profit rose 13% on year in the first half of the year due to higher interest income and commissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares in Asia's second-largest oil refiner, Sinopec, rose 1.9% in Hong Kong after the company reported a 24% increase in first-half net profit as it improved its refining margins and narrowed losses at its chemical business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More broadly, there were few Asian trading cues Monday, with markets taking their lead from Wall Street's gain Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3% after new home sales for July were much lower than forecast--at 394,000 compared with expectations for 490,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The below-view data reduced expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve's withdrawal of its stimulus was imminent. In recent months, markets have been closely watching U.S. economic data for signs on whether the Fed will alter monetary policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">South Korea's Kospi rose 1% to 1887.86 and Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 inched up 0.2% to 5135.40.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weaker expectations for a change in Fed policy supported the price of gold, which reached its highest price since June 6 early in the session before weakening a touch as the day progressed. The precious metal hit $1,407.10 an ounce and was at $1,396.10 late in Asia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, regional gold miners received a boost: <span class="companylink">Newcrest Mining</span> bounced 4.9% higher in Sydney and <span class="companylink">Zhaojin Mining Industry Co</span>. surged 8% in Hong Kong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The yen was a touch higher against the U.S. dollar in late Asian trade, at ¥98.53 compared with ¥98.71 late Friday in New York--consolidating after the greenback gained 1.2% against its Japanese counterpart over the last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stronger currency in Japan translated into small movements for stocks in Tokyo, with the Nikkei falling 0.2% to 13636.28. The market was also moderating after a sharp 2.2% gain Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weaker dollar invited profit-taking in automakers early, with <span class="companylink">Suzuki Motor</span> suffering a 1.9% loss by the end of the day. The firm, which is heavily exposed to Indian markets, has lost 14% since mid-August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Tokyo Electric Power</span> tumbled 6.9% to Y473 in Tokyo as more media exposure over radioactive water leaks from a storage tank at the firm's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant stoked fears about recovery efforts and other utilities' nuclear restart efforts.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar slipped against most major currencies after a report showed new home sales in the U.S. fell, raising doubts about a housing-market recovery that has been a key driver of growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales dropped 13.4% in July, the Commerce Department said Friday, which was the steepest decline seen in three years. Investors are paying close attention to U.S. economic indicators as they try to predict whether the Federal Reserve will follow through with a pull-back from its monetary stimulus program next month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed has been buying bonds to keep interest rates low and support growth, and speculation the central bank will begin to scale back those purchases as early as this fall has led to a backup in long-term interest rates in the U.S., increasing the appeal of the dollar. But any sign that the economy may be faltering has led to concern among traders that the Fed will decide to delay any reduction in its bond purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar fell against the euro and was slightly weaker against the yen and Australian dollar. Broadly speaking, the U.S. currency remained within its recent trading range as investors wait for more clarity on the Fed's next move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing numbers were terrible, but people need to see more of it to be convinced" the Fed won't start to wind down its bond buying, said George Dowd, who heads <span class="companylink">Newedge USA</span>'s foreign-exchange trading desk in Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar was at ¥98.71 from ¥98.72 late Thursday. Against the Swiss franc, the dollar was at 0.9221 Swiss franc from 0.9232 franc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wall Street Journal Dollar Index, which tracks the U.S. dollar against a basket of currencies, was at about 73.86 from about 73.93.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the euro zone, signs that consumer confidence is on the mend gave the common currency a modest lift. The <span class="companylink">European Commission</span> said Friday its early estimate of consumer confidence in the 17 nations that use the single currency rose in August to -15.6 from -17.4, the highest level since July 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro was at $1.3380 from $1.3356. The common currency was at ¥132.07 from ¥131.85.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.K. pound was at $1.5580 from $1.5589.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in the winter, the air conditioner is working hard -- boosting a home's value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An analysis of property listings in 22 major metro areas found that homes with central air conditioning are offered for 13% more, on average, than homes without central air, according to real-estate brokerage Redfin. Cities in the Midwest see the widest price gap: Homes with central air are listed for 105% more than homes without central air.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, homes with central air may have other amenities that help bump up the list price. But AC seems to be a driving force in the decision making, according to the National Association of Realtors, a trade group. In a survey of recent home buyers released in November, central air was the No. 1 feature sought when house shopping, according to the survey of 2,005 respondents who bought a home between 2010 and 2012. Respondents who purchased a home without central AC would be willing to pay $2,520 more for a home with this feature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don Prather, technical services manager of Air Conditioning Contractors of America, another trade association, says homeowners are installing new features that are both high tech and energy efficient. Touch screens on thermostats make it easy to control temperatures in zones throughout the house. Some systems allow remote access so homeowners (or even the utility company) can adjust settings to manage energy consumption, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luxury homes tend to have more of these high-tech features than starter homes, but because they are larger and have more amenities, the upscale properties typically use more energy, according to Home Innovation Research Labs, a subsidiary of the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some eco-friendly options, such as geothermal heat pumps, are increasingly common in luxury homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These units can both heat and cool by drawing from the relatively stable temperatures within the earth, says Ed Hudson, director of the market-research division at Home Innovation Research Labs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years ago, Amy Musser and her husband, Matthew Vande, oversaw the design and construction of their 2,800-square-foot home in Asheville, N.C. The structure was tightly insulated, and the couple added solar panels to generate electricity and a geothermal heat pump for heating and cooling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house cost just under $500,000 to build, but energy incentives in the form of tax credits and rebates lowered the overall cost, says Ms. Musser, who with her husband founded the technical-consulting firm VandeMusser Design.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now they can crow about their savings: "My average bill is probably $10 a month. And that's pretty much just service charges," she says.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jeffrey Sparshott and Eric Morath   </div><div>423 words</div><div>22 August 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The housing market showed further signs of strength in July, with sales of previously owned homes jumping as buyers locked in low interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales rose 6.5% in July from a month earlier to an annual rate of 5.39 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Wednesday, and were 17.2% higher than a year ago. The increase was the best month of sales since November 2009, when a home-buyer tax credit spurred activity. Prices also continued to climb, notching year-over-year gains for 17 consecutive months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A resurgent housing market has aided the slow-growing U.S. economy, helping generate confidence among consumers, boosting household spending and creating construction jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">July's sales and price increases came as mortgage rates rose from historical lows. Rates on 30-year fixed mortgages were 4.70% on Tuesday, up from 3.56% in early May, according to Bankrate.com. The pace of buying continued despite the rising cost of a home loan, in part because some buyers may have sought to lock in purchases before rates go even higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Today's report is about a 'rush to buy' ahead of higher rates and higher rate expectations," Jonathan Basile, director of U.S. economics at <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>, said in a research note. "Higher rates should cool sales in coming months."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales are counted once transactions are completed, which would mean that many of the contracts were signed in May and June as interest rates started their climb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to higher rates, rising prices, skilled-labor shortages and a shortage of buildable land are all possible factors that could moderate home sales. Builders last month, for instance, started construction on single-family homes at the slowest pace in eight months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the latest sales numbers indicate strong demand among would-be home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of homes sold in July was $213,500, up 13.7% from a year earlier. And the number of homes listed for sale, at 2.28 million in July, rose by 5.6% from June but stood 5% below the level of one year ago, suggesting that home prices should continue to go up, though perhaps more slowly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the current pace of sales, it would take 5.1 months to sell the existing stock of homes for sale, down from 6.3 months one year earlier.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent afternoon, actors stood around a kitchen pouring glasses of fake sparkling wine. A cameraman operating a dolly stood ready.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It needs to look like, 'I want to be in that house, be in that group,' " said Curt Hahn, a director of thousands of television commercials and producer of the 2008 movie "Two Weeks," starring Sally Field. Now, he was at work on his latest project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The camera focused on a man in a vest pouring drinks, then panned to show the movie's real star, the 470-square-foot kitchen with walnut floors, granite countertops, under-cabinet lighting and a large central island under a skylight. This film has one purpose: to sell a 4,000-square-foot condominium with two wood-burning fireplaces and wide, gallery-style hallways in the West End neighborhood of Nashville, Tenn., listed for $1.795 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Minimovies and Hollywood-style trailers complete with scripts, musical scores and even action sequences are cropping up as a new way to pitch pricey homes and condominium buildings. According to the National Association of Realtors, 14% of sellers used video to help sell their homes in 2012, up from 9% five years ago. Mr. Hahn, the director and CEO of Film House, said he shot his first real-estate minimovie in September of last year. He has since shot nearly 10, doing about one a week since June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agents and developers who commission the films say that perfectly lighted rooms and aspirational story lines help grab buyers, and are the next extension of a home-buying experience that has increasingly gone online. Budgets for such films are often a percentage of the home's listing price, and can range from a couple thousand dollars to $1 million or more for large-scale productions marketing condo buildings. The cost is paid either by the listing agents or sellers, and sometimes split between them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Particularly when buying high-end houses, people really don't want to spend time looking," said Tom Patterson, the 4,000-square-foot condo's listing agent. "The video shows it in a much stronger light [than photos] and with a little story for it, it adds a little emotion."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the kitchen shoot, Mr. Hahn and Mr. Patterson met with Sherry Howell, a retired business executive, and Everette Howell, a retired neurosurgeon. The couple are asking $2.8 million for their 6,000-square-foot hilltop contemporary home. Mr. Hahn pitched a three-act story line centered on a charity auction where guests would bid to spend a week at the home. The final scene would take place in the living room, to maximize the home's dramatic views.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Then fade to black?" asked Mr. Howell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Well, fade to Tom's logo," said Mr. Hahn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Howells gave the film the green light. "This is cutting edge and we're like the beta test for it," said Ms. Howell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Movie making is particularly popular in slower-selling markets. Though sales are picking up, homes in Nashville priced over $1 million still typically take a year or more to sell, said Anne Nilsson, a Nashville-based agent. She and partner Keith Merrill commissioned Mr. Hahn to create his first real-estate minimovie last year, a three-minute film depicting an actor following a series of clues on Post-it Notes through a 6,000-square-foot Southern Colonial-style home, leading to an actress playing his daughter, grinning as she shows him a Harvard acceptance letter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I called my husband into my office in London and said, 'take a look at this'," said Judy Neal, a retired directors' representative, who said she liked how the video emphasized the home's estate-like feel and walkable, in-town location. She and her husband flew over to see the home and wound up paying $1.435 million for it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Samuels, who owns an entertainment-advertising agency in Los Angeles, said his real-estate broker, Eric Lavey, offered to create a film about a midcentury modern bachelor pad he was selling in the Hollywood Hills that had been on the market for about a month at $950,000. The film centered on a young man coming home from work and getting ready for a night out on the town, including shots of nearby Sunset Boulevard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Most videos, it's like elevator music and camera tilts and pans across the room, and then you see another room," said Mr. Samuels. The home sold for $920,000 less than a month after its video made its debut online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another film, shot in a $6.495 million listing Mr. Lavey has near Palm Springs, features an actor portraying the home's owner getting picked up from his private jet. The house is still privately listed for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High-end condo developers are using short films to help drum up interest in properties still months or years from completion. Developers for the Mansions at Acqualina, a building expected to be completed next year in Sunny Isles, Fla., spent $200,000 on a short film to market the building's 15,000-square-foot, $55 million penthouse. With no dialogue, the production features live actors portraying a family going about their day in a hyper-realistic CGI rendering of the sprawling apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These films are distributed in a number of ways. A film produced to promote Jade Signature, an oceanfront condo building under construction in Sunny Isles, Fla., will be sent first to early buyers this fall by DVD or iPad and will then debut in the building's sales office when it opens in early 2014. (Prices of the building's units will range from $1.8 million to over $26 million.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sellers of a $35 million Malibu home loaded a short film onto gift-wrapped iPads last summer. Titled "The Spider and the Fly," the movie features a mysterious woman clad in black running through rooms of the house, as maids and cooks prepare the home for a party. (The film is also viewable online at Vimeo.) The property, owned by real-estate developer DeeAnna Staats, is still on the market. Ms. Staats declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some moviemakers try to push the creative envelope. For 432 Park Avenue, slated to be the tallest residential building in New York when it is completed in 2015, developers created a cheeky, dreamlike sequence set to Mama Cass's "Dream A Little Dream." The film stars Philippe Petit, the high-wire artist famous for balancing across landmarks and skyscrapers. At one point, King Kong climbs the building, revealed a few moments later to be the co-developer, Harry Macklowe, in a costume. The film is viewable only at the building's sales showroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others are defying the long-held belief that sex is off-limits in real-estate ads so as to not offend any potential buyers. One real-estate minimovie for a luxury home in Queensland, Australia, features an underwear-clad young woman tied to a chair in a large, glass-filled house as helicopters fly overhead. A SWAT team with machine guns swarms the property. The final scene includes two men rescuing the woman; they later pull off masks to reveal themselves as the home's listing agents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The script for the three-minute, $15,000 film was dreamed up by Australia-based real-estate film company Platinum HD. U.S.-based owner and President Duncan Schieb, who produced the action film, said his goal is to make a splash with real-estate videos that "go viral" online. The more scintillating the story lines, the better. The Queensland home sold for $3.45 million, and the movie, which was posted on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>, has been viewed more than 5 million times, according to Mr. Schieb. Platinum HD opened its first U.S. office last year in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ryan Serhant, a broker with Nest Seekers International and a star of the reality show "Million Dollar Listing New York," recently commissioned a film for a penthouse at 200 Eleventh Avenue, a 19-story building known for its en-suite sky garages and celebrity buyers. The film, which will be in the style of a Hollywood movie trailer, will cost at least $20,000 and will include helicopters, "fast cars" and models, said Mr. Serhant. Mr. Schieb said it would also combine elements of the Hollywood films "Inception" and "Memento."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's going to be a bigger-than-life apartment," said Mr. Serhant. "I can't have a dinky little listing video."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all agents are sold on the tactic. Stephen Shapiro, chairman of Westside Estate Agency, a brokerage with offices in Beverly Hills and Malibu, said he thinks Hollywood-style trailers and marketing videos are, in general, a waste of time and money because most of them don't include enough of the type of information buyers want, such as location or square footage. Minimovies and trailers are more for the benefit of agents in a market where competition for a scarce number of listings is increasingly cutthroat. "[Agents] are always looking for the one additional thing that the competition doesn't have," he said. "They're used as listing tools, not as selling tools."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some brokers are skipping the story lines and are creating more elaborate home-tour movies. "I prefer not to focus on anything other than the property," said Rob Giem, a Newport Beach, Calif.-based broker who has been producing films to sell some of his higher-end listings. A couple of years ago, he spent close to $100,000 on a film to market a contemporary-style home in Cabo San Lucas. It features sweeping shots of the oceanfront home shot with high-definition cameras from a helicopter. Mr. Giem says the home will probably hit the market officially later this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moviemaking trend does face one major stumbling block: the improving market. Many homes have been selling within one or two days of hitting the market, said Mr. Lavey, pre-empting the need for an elaborate movie. In Palm Springs, however, very high-end homes often still take a year to sell. "There are a lot of houses that would be amazing in videos," he said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Heather Haddon </div><div>1000 words</div><div>21 August 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A13</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jersey City's gleaming corporate towers and luxury residential skyscrapers were built in the past three decades with the aggressive use of tax breaks that helped transformed its waterfront district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the city's new mayor, Steve Fulop, says he will steer those tax breaks away from the waterfront in hopes of attracting development, residents and companies to poorer and less saturated neighborhoods in New Jersey's second-largest city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fulop said his plan -- to be announced this week -- would give more incentives to developers building particularly in two other neighborhoods with plentiful transit options: Journal Square, which has a PATH station three stops from Manhattan, and Bergen-Lafayette neighborhoods, which has several light-rail stops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sweeping overhaul of the tax-break plan would precede the city's launch this fall of a $1 million marketing campaign targeting New York companies and residents to move across the Hudson River for cheaper space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a window for us to be aggressive," said Mr. Fulop, who took office in July after defeating the incumbent mayor, Jerramiah Healy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fulop's plan would mark a significant shift in development policy for Jersey City, which has successfully wooed Wall Street commercial tenants and young professionals from New York City in recent years. Its Hudson River skyline was spurred by the city's tax policies, with nearly every waterfront tower -- including those housing <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> and <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span> -- getting breaks known as abatements, Mr. Fulop said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tax abatements have been embraced by cities across the country to spur development, including New York, where new towers on the Brooklyn and Queens waterfronts have received breaks. Each deal is structured differently, but typically allow a developer to forgo a certain portion of state property, school or county taxes for a set number of years. The property is typically still on the hook for local taxes, and in Jersey City, roughly 20% of its $516 million budget comes from properties that have tax abatements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jersey City has "utilized the program much more than the neighboring communities," said Robert Kossar, an executive managing director at <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle Americas Inc</span>., the broker for developers in Jersey City that used abatements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers say the incentives are essential for building in cities, which typical have higher construction costs than in the suburbs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Jersey City's abatement program has been criticized. Some argue the tax breaks starve the state and school districts of revenue and give local officials unregulated say over fiscal decisions affecting the rest of the state. State Comptroller Matthew Boxer cited Jersey City in a 2010 report that found significant revenue was being lost through tax abatements. The city exempted property valued at roughly $2 billion at the time, leading to a loss of about $120 million in property taxes and $30 million in Hudson County revenues, the report found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city currently has abatements on 151 properties, a spokeswoman said. Their value wasn't available Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a City Council member, Mr. Fulop was a strident critic of the abatements, saying they were ripe for mismanagement and given out too freely. He said he would -- for the first time -- set firm criteria for giving out abatements based on where the developers built in the city to spur more investment in targeted areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're trying to move away from the stigma that Jersey City has had for a long time that it's about who you know," Mr. Fulop said. "We are taking the politics out of this."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Healy defended his use of tax abatements, saying negotiated agreements were better than a set policy. "I like to have the most discretion possible," he said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Healy said the process of awarding the tax breaks was transparent and the Jersey City waterfront wouldn't have been rebuilt without them. "It was abandoned railroad yards and abandoned rotting warehouses. Everyone was afraid to invest down there," Mr. Healy said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The abatement program grew, in part, out of a 1961 state law that allowed localities to provide tax breaks in so-called blighted areas. The law was further expanded in 1992, allowing for more urban areas to qualify.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jersey City warmed to tax breaks in the 1980s, when the city was losing its waterfront industry and residents. In 1986, the <span class="companylink">LeFrak Organization</span> tapped abatements to help build the 600-acre Newport mixed-use development on the waterfront.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jersey City was sued in 2009 by a developer who accused the Healy administration of favoritism when a competitor received a more generous tax break. The city settled the suit last year, giving the plaintiff nearly $900,000 more in tax breaks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fulop set up a transition team to review the abatement program this year. Developers with current abatements -- such as LeFrak -- were at the table. A review found that some were given out without the developer providing justification, said William O'Dea, an Elizabeth economic-development official who consulted with the committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Very few of the abatements had a thorough market study review," said Mr. O'Dea, a Hudson County Freeholder who backed Mr. Fulop. "It just became like crack in the rush to get so much development done."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fulop's plan creates a four-tier system of abatements lasting between five and 30 years, with the longest ones available in the areas targeted for redevelopment. The shortest ones will still be available for the waterfront. Developers can get additional tax breaks if they build pre-schools or use local labor on their projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kossar said Journal Square's market has shown promise. He said there would still be interest in building on the city's waterfront.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fulop said he plans to adopt the new policy with an executive order in the next week. It will be used on abatements as early as those under review during next Wednesday's City Council meeting, he said.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Private Equity Retries China --- Firms Dip Back Into Residential Investments as Government Eases Controls</span>
</div><div class="author">By Esther Fung </div><div>731 words</div><div>21 August 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C9</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHANGHAI -- Foreign private-equity firms appear to be dipping their toes back into the residential real-estate market in China, after a nearly four-year government campaign to rein in sky-high housing prices curbed the appetite for investment in the local housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An Asia-focused real-estate fund run by <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span> made an offer this week to acquire Chinese property developer <span class="companylink">Tysan Holdings Ltd</span>. for 2.5 billion Hong Kong dollars (US$322 million).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, Texas-based private-equity firm Century Bridge Capital invested US$44.4 million in a joint venture with Hong Kong-listed property developer <span class="companylink">Coastal Greenland Ltd</span>. to build a middle-income residential project in Wuhan, a city in central China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, UBS AG said last week that its asset-management unit is teaming up with a district government in Shanghai and an insurance company to start a public-housing investment fund that could use public and private financing to help China build more low-cost homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2010, China's central government tightened property-sector controls, aiming to rein in runaway house prices. But with growth fragile and the real-estate sector a significant contributor to demand for everything from steel to furniture, policy makers have taken a more-relaxed approach in 2013, and property sales and prices in many cities have rebounded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This has prompted some foreign institutional investors to resume their investments in China's property market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overseas-based real-estate managers have raised US$1.6 billion in closed-end funds for residential property investment in China this year, higher than the US$800 million raised in 2012 and the US$400 million in 2011, according to data tracker Preqin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> said its investment in Tysan, a small developer that engages in mainly residential property development and investment in Shanghai, Tianjin and Shenyang, is "an opportunity to enlarge its footprint in the real-estate market" in China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Century Bridge said last month that its investment in Wuhan is "right in line with our strategy of investing in middle-income, residential housing in tier-two cities, which targets opportunities that capitalize on China's larger urbanization trend." Century Bridge Chief Executive Tom Delatour said in an interview that "in China, you're now seeing good sales, slightly rising housing prices . . . The returns are solid."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign investors also are looking at niche sectors in the housing market, such as serviced-residence projects in major cities, to limit risks stemming from policy curbs on home purchases, real-estate analysts said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Investors are always on the lookout for residential projects to invest in, but because of the home-purchase restrictions, they have found it hard to find projects that fit their investment criteria," said Regina Yang, China's head of research and consulting at property consultancy Knight Frank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They have had to look for more indirect projects to benefit from the improved home-buying sentiment."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, many foreign funds still aren't that enthusiastic about the residential property sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides having to jostle with local players, the uncertainty of Beijing's policy moves and the anticipated expansion of a property tax nationwide are holding back foreign investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many foreign investors aren't "well-practiced in the fine art of mainland political gamesmanship" and still prefer to invest in the less-politicized commercial sector such as office and shopping malls, according to a recent report by Urban Land Institute, a nonprofit real-estate research organization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is investment money available for deals, but I don't see much excitement in the residential market," said David Blumenfeld, a Shanghai-based partner at law firm Paul Hastings. "Current government policies don't favor residential development, and no one can say with clarity what the policies will be like over the next several years."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Carlyle Group</span>'s recent property investments in China, for instance, excluded residential projects. It bought two shopping malls in Suzhou and Hangzhou in May and one office building in Shanghai in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market in China for the past year has been supported by a recovery in housing sales, and many of the larger developers have benefited from stronger cash flow and were able to fund pricier land plots and projects.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a group led by veteran investor Barry Sternlicht paid nearly $2.8 billion in 2009 for the assets of failed commercial-real-estate lender Corus Bank, which went under during the financial crisis, many of his competitors were sure he had overpaid. Turns out they were wrong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, Mr. Sternlicht's group agreed to sell four high-end apartment buildings to <span class="companylink">Winthrop Realty Trust</span>, a Boston-based REIT, for $246 million. It was a small transaction but it represents one of the final steps in unwinding the Corus investment -- one of the highest-profile real-estate deals of the downturn. Mr. Sternlicht says he has doubled the value of the $1.4 billion investment made by his <span class="companylink">Starwood Capital Group</span> and its partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sternlicht's trade shows how real-estate investors who put their chips down during the darkest days of the downturn, which at the time seemed highly risky, are starting to cash in their bets as the market improves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're starting to see the first waves of flips from investors who bought distressed deals in 2009," said Dan Fasulo, a managing director at <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, a New York research firm. "It's nice to see them harvesting some of the gains from that purchase."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Winthrop deal is the first portion of a 13-building portfolio of rental apartment buildings that the Starwood group is selling. Mr. Sternlicht says that once all 13 buildings are sold, all that will remain of the Corus portfolio will be $300 million in real estate assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This has been a great, great risk-adjusted trade for everyone," Mr. Sternlicht said. The group his company led, which included private investment firms <span class="companylink">TPG Capital</span>, <span class="companylink">Perry Capital LLC</span> and WLR LeFrak, bought the Corus portfolio in October 2009 using about $1.4 billion in equity and about $1.4 billion in interest-free debt from the federal government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corus, which was one of the nation's leading lenders to condominium developers, was seized by federal regulators in September 2009 after more than half of its condo construction loans fell into nonaccrual or foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its deposits were assumed by another bank, but the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp</span>. took control of its $4.5 billion loan portfolio. The FDIC, in turn, established a joint venture to own the loans, and later that year, Starwood and its partners won the bid to buy 40% of that venture. Under the terms of the regulator's structured-sale program, the FDIC held on to the other 60%, meaning that the federal government also will take 60% of the Starwood group's gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, Starwood's bid scared off the competition; it was 20% higher than the next-highest amount offered by any of the other bidders, including Santa Monica, Calif.-based <span class="companylink">Colony Capital LLC</span> and New York's Related Cos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When they acquired the Corus portfolio, there were two or three groups that were hotly bidding on it, and people said they overpaid," says Michael Ashner, Winthrop's chief executive. "I really don't think they did. They're going to make a very good return."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late 2009, Starwood established a property asset-management firm, ST Residential, to help it relaunch stalled apartment towers and sell individual condos on a retail -- or one-by-one -- basis. In South Florida, where Corus had lent money on some 2,300 condos and where a recent wave of cash from foreign investors has driven condo prices to nearly $350 per square foot -- close to what they sold for during the boom -- only 25 units from the portfolio remain, Mr. Sternlicht said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, with most of Corus's condos sold, the Starwood group has moved on to selling its rental-apartment portfolio in bulk. In last week's deal, Winthrop signed a contract to buy four luxury apartment buildings in Phoenix, Houston, Los Angeles and Stamford, Conn., representing 761 rental units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a regulatory filing, Winthrop said the four buildings -- 44 Monroe in Phoenix, Highgrove in Stamford, Conn., Mosaic II in Houston and the San Pedro Lofts in Los Angeles -- are all between 87% and 95% occupied, and loaded with the type of luxury amenities typical of high-end condo towers built during the boom, including spas, club rooms, yoga studios, infinity pools, and sun decks with barbecues and outdoor fireplaces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What we're selling now -- these are assets that we rented, because we didn't think there would be a for-sale market for them," Mr. Sternlicht said. "It's quicker and more efficient to sell them off as rental properties."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Winthrop's Mr. Ashner said the deal isn't typical for Winthrop, which is best known for buying distressed real estate, renovating it and selling it for a profit, rather than buying fully leased luxury apartment buildings.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Molly Hensley-Clancy </div><div>830 words</div><div>21 August 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the troubled Blue Hills neighborhood of Kansas City, Mo., a sprawling, weedy lot has become a symbol of the risks of urban retail projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A partnership between the city and its developers bulldozed some 60 homes and businesses on the site beginning in 2003, hoping to develop a 250,000-square-foot shopping and residential complex named Citadel Plaza.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the partnership collapsed into a legal mess and there has been no building on the site to this day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What was blight is still blight," says Cindy Circo, the city councilwoman who represents the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some inner-city areas once shunned by the private sector, retail developments have been successful and even transformative for neighborhoods. For example, Pittsburgh's East Liberty neighborhood was revitalized in the late 1990s by a retail development anchored by <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> and Target. In the Washington neighborhood of Columbia Heights, a shopping center built in 2008 catalyzed other retail development there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Citadel Plaza shows how this strategy can hit a wall. Besides fights between the city and the developer, the proposed $80 million project also suffered because it had difficulty attracting a tenant to a low-income area with a declining population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Urban retail projects can be successful in low-income areas as long as the there is enough density to support stores and restaurants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that hasn't been the case in Blue Hills, where the population has been declining steadily since 1980, including a drop of more than 17% from 1990 to 2001.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You can draw the plans and you may be able to get the financing together, but if you don't have the buying power, it's very hard to get retailers to commit," says Patrick Phillips, chief executive of the Urban Land Institute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city is again planning to seek out a developer for Citadel Plaza. But a recent study commissioned by the city warned the "stigma" attached to the area could pose a problem in attracting customers and tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two retail developments exist within minutes of the site, according to the study. Both have vacancy rates of at least 50%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For decades, developers and retailers wanted little to do with low-income urban areas. But that began to change in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when big-box retailers such as <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span> and Target began taking advantage of high population density coupled with limited competition. But by now, developers have built in the most fertile downtown areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All the easy ones have been done," Mr. Phillips says. "What's left are more marginal and high-risk locations."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Located on Kansas City's troubled East Side, Blue Hills was once a working-class white neighborhood, servicing the city's cattle and rail industries. But white flight in the 1960s and '70s stripped the neighborhood of much of its infrastructure and began a trend of population decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the median income hovers near $26,000, well below the city's average, with home values that are less than half of those in Kansas City as a whole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City officials have been hoping to revitalize the area around the Citadel Plaza site for more than a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan called for the project to include restaurants, retail, a grocery store and housing and be subsidized by selling city bonds and obtaining federal subsidies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main developer on the project was a small nonprofit firm called the Community Development Corp. of Kansas City. The now-defunct company had been involved in developing housing projects and two shopping centers that were less than half the size of the proposed Citadel Plaza development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developer relocated residents and demolished houses on the site, but never moved into a construction phase or announced a tenant. In 2006, government agencies temporarily halted work because of concerns that asbestos hadn't been properly removed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">P.J. O'Connor, an attorney for former Community Development Corp. head William Threatt Jr., said Mr. Threatt declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city council tried to jump-start the project in 2008 by selling $20.5 million in bonds. But the city was unable to pull off the bond sale because of fiscal troubles elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developer sued the city, charging that it had reneged on its promise to provide funds. The city countersued, accusing the developer of not meeting its commitments. The city eventually agreed to settle for $15 million, money that the CDC used to pay off creditors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, Mr. Threatt faced federal criminal charges of asbestos violations at the Citadel Plaza site. He and an employee pleaded guilty and were sentenced to probation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The site is still contaminated with asbestos and is undergoing cleanup expected to finish in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This issue is very personal to me," says Ms. Circo, the city councilwoman. "The people that lived there and have lived through this deserve something more."</p>

</div><div class="author">Eamon Quinn </div><div>932 words</div><div>21 August 2013</div><div>13:06</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DUBLIN—Ireland is set to end its three-year reliance on international aid at the end of this year, but that achievement will be of little immediate benefit to many Irish people trapped with home loans they will likely never be able to repay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The painful legacy of the property market and banking collapse that forced Ireland to seek a €67.5 billion ($90 billion) bailout from the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> and the <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span> has left house prices at nearly half their boom-time levels of 2007, according to official data published this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many Irish homeowners are finding it difficult to make their mortgage payments as a consequence of the government's austerity program and rising unemployment, currently at 13.5% of the workforce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deep scars left in the economy from the crash have spared no regions and the austerity cure could make for a long road back to Ireland's former status as a Celtic tiger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ross Maguire, a senior lawyer who in 2010 helped set up New Beginning, a nonprofit organization that provides legal and financial advice to distressed homeowners, said the scale of Ireland's problem isn't widely understood outside the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You have a very large real-estate collapse together with a recession," he said. "By any international standard, it is a huge collapse."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Irish central-bank figures show the number of Irish home loans in arrears has almost doubled to more than 12% of all principal home loans in the past two years. Those loans are linked to outstanding bank mortgage loans valued at more than €18 billion, or 16.5% of the value of all outstanding residential home loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Caroline Lennon, a public-sector worker, has seen the value of her home more than halve since she bought it in 2007, just before prices crashed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Getting back to markets and emerging from the bailout means very little to ordinary people because we will be paying for the crash for many years to come," said Ms. Lennon, who is struggling to repay a €320,000 ($430,000) loan on her home in County Carlow in southeastern Ireland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I am one of the lucky ones who kept their job. But my pay has been cut and there has been on top of that a substantial amount of pension cuts," said Ms. Lennon, referring to cuts the government made to the pensions of public-sector workers. Ms. Lennon set up Irish Homeowners Unite, a campaigning group for distressed borrowers that advises households on their options, which may involve striking deals to reschedule but not to write down mortgage debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ireland's house prices have recently shown signs of stabilizing for the first time since 2007, with prices having risen on an annual basis for four straight months, according to the Central Statistics Office. But the country may still struggle to bring an end to its household-debt crisis until it finds a way to help its weakened banks pare down the large number of mortgage loans on their books that are in arrears.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The banks do not have the capital to take a hit and the sovereign does not want to put more money into the banks," said Ciaran Callaghan, an analyst at <span class="companylink">Merrion Capital</span>. "And therein lies the dilemma."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Irish government, which during the crisis bailed out six banks at a cost of €64 billion, has insisted that taxpayers have already provided enough capital for the lenders to deal with the arrears backlog. It has said that it won't sanction any widespread writing down debt because it can't afford do so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To help out distressed homeowners, the government introduced new insolvency laws that come into effect in the next few months. The legislation aims to make it easier for these homeowners to negotiate "sustainable" deals on their mortgages with lenders, although the term hasn't been detailed yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of the legislation, the <span class="companylink">Irish central bank</span> has imposed a series of rolling deadlines on lenders to review their home-loan portfolios and negotiate sustainable deals for those behind on their mortgage payments. But some critics say that the measures give lenders too much leverage, while not providing borrowers with any widespread debt write-down or relief.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both Bank of Ireland and <span class="companylink">Allied Irish Banks PLC</span>, the country's two biggest lenders, say that a majority of their mortgage customers are meeting their mortgage payments. The banks say that large write-downs would deepen their losses, as homeowners who can afford to pay would likely stop making payments and effectively default on their mortgage debts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The household-debt crisis looms large over the government, which faces a general election in early 2016. Prime Minister Enda Kenny has set his government's hopes on refinancing a large part of the country's remaining bank-rescue costs with the European Stability Mechanism, the euro zone's bailout fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But euro-zone politicians have been slow to reach any such deal, and many at the heart of the Irish mortgage-debt crisis believe the country's property ills will take years to mend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The banks are hoping that things improve and they will not have to actually start an aggressive approach [to their customers]," said Michael Dowling, head of the Independent Mortgage Advisers Federation, a home-loans selling group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are a long, long way from recovery," Mr. Dowling said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Min Zeng </div><div>691 words</div><div>21 August 2013</div><div>16:34</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The benchmark Treasury bond price tumbled to a near two-year low as the Federal Reserve's July policy meeting minutes bolstered expectations that the central bank would cut back on its stimulative bond buying as soon as next month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The benchmark 10-year note's yield climbed as high as 2.895%, coming close to topping a two-year peak of 2.899% set on Monday, according to CQG. Bond prices fall when their yields rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late-afternoon trade, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note's price fell by 20/32, yielding 2.888%, according to Tradeweb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The minutes for the July 30-31 meeting showed Fed officials remained split over the timing for the central bank to start cutting back on its $85 billion bond-buying program, designed to boost liquidity and spur economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's timeline to wind down the buying of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities garnered broad support among committee members, it showed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bernanke said during the news conference following the June policy meeting that the Fed would start scaling back on buying bonds later this year if the economic recovery gathers speed and that the program would end in mid-2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market thinks Bernanke enjoys the support of the committee on these asset purchases, and so the market heard a September tapering [in bond buying] is on track," said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at <span class="companylink">Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi</span> UFJ.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The minutes showed Fed officials expect the U.S. economy to strengthen in the second half of the year. Several officials are confident that the housing market is resilient despite higher bond yields that pushed up mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier Wednesday, a report showed U.S. existing home sales rose by 6.5% in July to the highest level in four years. But a separate release showed the number of mortgage applications filed in the U.S. last week dropped 5% from the prior week as interest rates increased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anxiety over the Fed pulling back from buying bonds has sent bond prices tumbling and yields sharply higher over the past three months. The 10-year yield has soared from 1.61% at the start of May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher Treasury yields raise long-term borrowing costs for the <span class="companylink">U.S. government</span> and the nation's consumers and businesses. They also make it more costly for foreign governments to sell dollar-denominated bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed's monetary stimulus via bond buying had sparked a strong price rally in a variety of riskier assets and sent U.S. stocks to record high prices earlier this month. Now the prospect of the Fed ratcheting back stimulus has stalled a further rally in stocks and over the past few sessions has roiled emerging-market stocks, bonds and currencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. bond mutual funds and exchange-traded funds have redeemed more than $100 billion since the start of June through Monday, including a record monthly outflow of $69.1 billion in June, according to TrimTabs Investment Research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More redemptions could add to more selling of bonds and send the 10-year yield above 3%, a level the market last traded back in July 2011, traders said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jason Rogan, managing director of <span class="companylink">US government</span> bond trading in New York at Guggenheim Securities LLC, said sentiment remains negative on bonds. "Unless we get some weak data in the following weeks, especially the [Sept. 6] jobs report, the market believes tapering in September is the way to go," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another blow to Treasury bonds, there was no consensus among Fed policy makers about strengthening forward guidance to keep the short-term policy rate near zero for an extended period of time. That disappointed bond bulls looking for the Fed to show firmer commitment to keeping short-term interest rates lower for an extended period of time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bernanke said in July even if a strengthening economy allows the Fed to reduce bond buying, the bank will keep its policy rate unchanged for a long period of time.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. stocks ended a volatile session with broad losses after the minutes to the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting provided little clarity on when the central bank might start paring back on stimulus measures</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Dow Jones Industrial</span> Average dropped 105.44 points, or 0.7%, to 14897.55. Soon after the release of the minutes, the <span class="companylink">Dow</span> fell as much as 122 points, then bounced sharply to be up as much as 17 points, before selling off again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline marked the sixth-straight loss for the blue-chip index, the longest losing streak since July 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P 500 index lost 9.55 points, or 0.6%, to 1642.80, while the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 13.80, or 0.4%, to 3599.79.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All 10 S&amp;P 500 sectors declined, led by the utilities and consumer discretionary sectors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed minutes showed that "few" officials favored reducing its bond-purchase programs soon, while a "few" urged more caution. But the minutes also showed that a number of Fed members were "somewhat less confident" about a near-term pickup in economic growth than they had been in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If anything, the minutes underscored that the Fed's decision on any pullback will depend in large part on how the economy is holding up—putting even more emphasis on coming data, including the monthly jobs report due Sept. 6.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a mixed and muddled message," said Keith Bliss, senior vice president at New York brokerage Cuttone &amp; Co. "The problem we're having is that the situation has gotten so complicated, [the Fed] is having a tough time conveying a simple-to-understand message."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Uncertainty over the Fed's intentions has weighed on stock markets in the U.S. and abroad and pushed up Treasury yields over the past few weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Treasury bonds sold off immediately after the minutes were released, pushing benchmark yields as high as 2.884% shortly after the minutes were released, near the two-year peak of 2.899% set on Monday. Yields settled at 2.852%, up from 2.816% on Tuesday. The dollar gained ground against both the euro and the yen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There was nothing in the minutes that deviates from the current belief that the Fed would start tapering bond buying next month," said Jason Rogan, managing director of <span class="companylink">U.S. government</span> bond trading in New York at Guggenheim Securities LLC, noting that the minutes showed broad support for Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's timeline of tapering bond buying with an end date of mid-2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist at Northern Trust, which manages $803 billion in assets, said the late bounce in stocks was tied to the fact that the Fed didn't appear as predisposed to reducing stimulus as investors feared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There was no smoking gun in the minutes that indicates they are itching to taper," Mr. McDonald said. That said, he expects the Fed to trim bond purchases by late October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier Wednesday, existing home sales for July rose 6.5% to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 5.39 million homes, the highest level since late 2009, beating expectations of a rise to 5.15 million homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">October crude-oil futures settled down 1.2% to $103.85 a barrel, while August gold futures slipped 0.2% to $1,370.60 an ounce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European markets fell as investors awaited the Fed minutes, with the Stoxx Europe 600 losing 0.5% to the lowest level since July 31.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asian markets were mixed. Japan's <span class="companylink">Nikkei</span> Stock Average seesawed between gains and losses before closing up 0.2%. China's Shanghai Composite inched up less than 0.1%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 0.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In corporate news, Target fell after the discount retailer reported fiscal second-quarter earnings that topped analyst estimates, but provided a downbeat outlook for the current quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lowe's rallied after the home-improvement retailer reported better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue, and raised its full-year outlook, amid an improving housing market.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOUSTON -- Like much of the rest of Texas, this city skipped the housing bubble and the subsequent bust. Home prices rose steadily throughout the 2000s here while they skyrocketed and then crashed elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Houston real-estate market, it turns out, supply adjusts unusually quickly to demand. Land is plentiful; zoning restrictions few. "Builders and developers here can ramp up relatively fast, which is why we haven't had bubbles in the [recent] past," said longtime mortgage banker Don Hickey of Amegy Mortgage Capital. "The market here responds very quickly."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But lately, Houston home builders have been unable to keep up with strong demand. As a result, home prices have been soaring. They are up about 12% from the same period last year, nearly twice the national pace, according to the latest <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> indexes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem: a shortage of land with sewers, utilities and roads on which builders can start construction, a consequence of banks reluctant to lend to developers of raw land because some of them were burned lending on land during the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no mystery about what is driving demand. Houston is a boomtown. When the energy business is good, so is the local real-estate market. The Census Bureau says only one other U.S. metro area added more people than Houston in the 12 months ended in July 2012: Dallas-Fort Worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders are responding. In the first six months of this year, the Houston metro area logged 25,050 home-building permits, more any other U.S. metro area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Cross Creek Ranch, a 3,200-acre development on the city's western fringe, entire blocks are clogged with construction vehicles, cement trucks, lunch trucks and pallets of bricks stacked in front of newly framed houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders have constructed 1,100 of the 5,500 homes planned for Cross Creek. New ones go for between $250,000 and $900,000, and prices are running 8% to 10% ahead of last year. Cross Creek builders sold 375 homes in the first seven months of this year, already surpassing the 2012 total of 300.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roughly one-third of the buyers are newcomers, most lured by jobs in Houston's energy, health-care and other growing industries, according to Cross Creek developer Johnson Development Corp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pipeline-company engineer Robert Kurima and his wife, Katherine, moved their family of five from Bakersfield, Calif., last year to Cross Creek. Their new 4,500-square-foot house, which they bought for $527,000, is larger and cheaper than their Bakersfield home. "This is probably more room than we need," Mr. Kurima said of his five-bedroom home. "But it allows us to grow into it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For decades, land has been a key to Houston's growth -- and its relatively low home prices. The median price for a previously occupied Houston home sold in the second quarter was $189,000 versus the national average of $203,500, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike some other parts of the country, home building here begins with land developers who buy huge tracts of empty land and prepare them for construction by getting government approvals and installing roads, sewers and other utilities. The process usually takes about a year and a half. Developers then sell parcels to home builders, who, in return, sell the finished houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Bankers generally are very conservative about loans against undeveloped land," said Keith Cargill, chief executive of Texas Capital Bank. "If a bank allows a client to get overloaded on land, then you have trouble." Raw land is considered risky because there is no income stream to pay off loans, among other reasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several Houston developers say that local banks that lent to them during the 2000s now are stingier, requiring developers to put in far more equity. A few developers have recruited private-equity firms or home builders as partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm putting down more money, with more money from the builders going into a deal, than ever before," said Michael Walton, owner of Houston's Mustang Development Inc. "Lenders are requiring a minimum of 30% of the total cost of acquisition and development in equity. They're still skittish." Before the recession, he said, lenders generally covered 75% of land cost and 100% of development cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Houston real-estate and banking circles, there is little concern about a potential bubble building caused by a lack of developed land. Supply and demand "will balance out, even though it has been out of balance for the past 10 months," said Will Holder, president of Trendmaker Homes, a <span class="companylink">Weyerhaeuser Co</span>. unit that is putting up houses in Cross Creek Ranch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edward Glaeser, a <span class="companylink">Harvard University</span> economist who has studied real-estate booms and busts throughout American history, isn't so sure. Houston, he said, could be seeing "a short-run supply constraint that corrects itself in two years and leaves some unhappy [home] buyers."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. TOP STORY: It's a story of continued ugliness in the more vulnerable Asian markets Tuesday. The Indonesian rupiah and the Indian rupee continued to tumble. The rupee fell to a fresh record low against the dollar for the third-straight session, touching INR63.75. The rupiah hit a four-year low of IDR10,700 though it came off its lows on suspected central bank intervention with two deals saying it sold around $200 million at the IDR10,500 level. The Malaysian ringgit was also supported by central bank intervention with dealers saying it sold nearly a billion dollars in the spot market after dollar/ringgit touched 3.30. Stocks across Asia were sold as well as with Jakarta down 3.2% and India's Sensex last down 0.5%. Concerns about the U.S. Federal Reserve tapering its bond-buying program, coupled with signs that Asia is slowing, are causing outflows from the region. The concern is that the cycle of fear perpetuates itself and leads to a mass exodus of funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"> You can almost see it spreading--last week the rupee was the focus, Monday the rupiah joined in and Tuesday we have the ringgit in the fray--and that despite the fact that Malaysia has run a bigger current account surplus than China, in terms of gross domestic product, every year since the Asian crisis ended. While the size of Asian foreign exchange reserves, and massively improved external balances and debt positions, should dispel any inappropriate speculation about a re-run of 1997, it is looking more and more likely that the turn of the U.S. cycle will be a big test for the guiding principle of Asian macroeconomics for the last 15 years--that self-reliance and massive foreign exchange reserves are the surest defense against the perceived tyranny of markets (and the <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span>).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. AUSTRALIA: The Australian dollar neared a two-week low Tuesday after the central bank released the minutes of its Aug. 6 policy meeting, when it cut its benchmark cash rate to a record low 2.50%. It told markets then future rate changes would be made only "as needed," removing earlier comments about its ample "scope" to cut. Many economists thought then the <span class="companylink">Reserve Bank of Australia</span> was ruling out further cuts. But the minutes indicated that the board was keen to communicate that the door was still open for more cuts. The Aug. 6 minutes said: "Regarding the communication of this decision, members agreed that the bank should neither close off the possibility of reducing rates further, nor signal an imminent intention to reduce rates further." Having seen the--ahem--mixed results of forward guidance in the U.K. and euro zone, the RBA appears to have come to the conclusion that the risks outweigh the potential benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. NEW ZEALAND: The central bank acted to curb house prices and will place restrictions on bank lending to home buyers with only small deposits from Oct. 1. The well-flagged move is aimed at damping house price inflation while allowing the cash rate to remain at a stimulatory level. House prices have reached record highs this year (up 6.6% on-year in July), fueled by a combination of low rates, a growing population in Auckland and the need to replace houses lost in the earthquakes centered around Christchurch, on the South Island. T he news caused a sharp fall for the kiwi--to US$0.7979 from US$0.8020 ahead of the announcement--while short-term rates fell 5 basis points. The move may enable the <span class="companylink">Reserve Bank of New Zealand</span> to delay any increase in its cash rate until it is more comfortable with global economic developments and domestic inflation. It is another in a growing list of experiments in the use of macro-prudential tools (rather than the blunt instrument of interest rates) to prevent or deflate asset bubbles caused by loose global monetary policy over recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4. CHINA: China unveiled a new financial body to coordinate regulatory policies in a move that gives an expanded role to the central bank. The group will be led by the central bank and consist of the heads of the banking, securities, insurance and foreign-exchange regulatory bodies. It's a sign that Beijing is taking further steps to prevent--or sees greater risk of--a systemic financial failure. A cash crunch in June briefly sent overnight lending rates surging to 30% on the interbank market. That liquidity squeeze spilled over to the stock market, sending prices tumbling, before the central bank stepped in to ease the interbank funding shortage. While the credit squeeze was partly related to slowing foreign capital inflows as well as seasonal tax and regulatory reporting factors, it also reflected a mismatch of short-term funding and long-term lending by some of the nation's banks. Regulators have been concerned that certain financial products--particularly some types of products that make up what is known as shadow banking--have been used to circumvent rules that limit bank lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5. JAPAN: Japan will need an extra spending package of up to 10 trillion yen ($103 billion) to protect its nascent economic recovery should the government go ahead with a sales tax rise next year, an economic adviser to the prime minister warns. Etsuro Honda, a leading critic of the plan to raise the 5% sales tax to 8% in April, told The Wall Street Journal that the central bank may also have to step up its purchasing of risky assets to help cushion the "extremely strong blow" to Japan's fledgling recovery. Mr. Honda--an architect of "Abenomics," the prime minister's economic policy mix of monetary easing, fiscal stimulus and pro-growth measures--reiterated that he was against the hike to 8%, instead calling for a one-percentage-point increase every year for five years. The comments from Mr. Honda come as debate intensifies on whether the government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe should proceed with the April tax hike--the first of a two-stage plan to double the levy by October 2015. Proponents say the increase is a vital first step to rein in Japan's debt, now twice the size of its economy, while opponents say it could derail efforts to drag the economy out of 15 years of deflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">6. TURKEY: The central bank raised its overnight interest rate by 0.50% to 7.75%, but left its one-week rate unchanged at 4.5%. Turkey has forever been the bridge between Asia and Europe, so it's a natural place to look for contagion from the Asian shakeout, especially given the vulnerabilities on its external accounts. As ever, the bank has sent somewhat mixed signals, simultaneously arguing in its statement that inflation is poised to come down. It left all of its other monetary policy tools unused. The overnight rate provides an effective ceiling on ultra-short money-market rates, and raising it will penalize local banks more heavily for misjudging their liquidity needs, thus giving them an incentive to hold their lira. But the immediate effect has not been that great, with market participants appearing to think that more is needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">7. U.K. Lending: Gross mortgage lending in July surged to an almost five-year high, a survey showed Tuesday, suggesting government stimulus packages are boosting housing market activity. The latest in a string of data that will only make it harder for the <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span> to convince markets it can hold interest rates down as long as it intends to. Cynics will also see it as further evidence of the government engineering a house price boomlet in time to win the next election. Given how many private U.K. fortunes depend on the outcomes of leveraged bets on the housing market, the potential for a clash between the BoE and the government is clear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">8. COMING UP:</p>

</div><div class="author">By Carmel Melouney </div><div>925 words</div><div>19 August 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A22</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Miki Naftali, the Israel-born real-estate investor best known in New York for overseeing the purchase and renovation of the Plaza Hotel, is emerging as one of the city's most prolific developers of condominiums and rental-apartment buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Naftali has purchased or launched developments of about a dozen properties since stepping down two years ago as chief executive of Elad Properties, a unit of an Israeli-owned conglomerate which controlled the Plaza during its sometimes-controversial renovation. His new company, the Naftali Group, owns property worth about $900 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its latest deal, the Naftali Group paid $20.1 million for four buildings on West 25th Street in two separate transactions. Those properties -- combined with an assemblage on the street that Naftali bought in late 2012 for $37 million -- gives the company a development site on which it plans to build a 12-story condo tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've developed many condominiums in Chelsea," says Mr. Naftali. "With its tree-lined street, West 25th is to be one of loveliest blocks in the neighborhood."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Naftali is one of the latest crop of developers moving to take advantage of the surge in New York apartment rents and condo prices. While many of the city's longtime developers are also in the scrum, strong markets like this one invariably attract new players.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In each cycle, some new players go on to build empires and make significant marks on the city's skyline. But the risks are high. If the recovery of the U.S. economy stalls and rents and sales take a dive in New York market, developers with unsold or unrented apartments could suffer losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Naftali agrees that real estate is "a very cyclical business," but says his company is "intensely focused" on mitigating risk. "By keeping an eye on our last dollar, we believe we have a substantial margin of safety. . .even in a down market," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Naftali also is backed by a long list of big name investors. He says about a dozen institutions invest with his company including <span class="companylink">SL Green Realty Corp</span>., <span class="companylink">AEW Capital Management</span> and <span class="companylink">Praedium Group LLC</span>. The Naftali Group, which has 22 employees, also gets funding from many major banks including <span class="companylink">HSBC</span>, TD Bank, <span class="companylink">PNC Financial Services</span> and <span class="companylink">Israel Discount Bank Ltd</span>., he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Naftali, who grew up in Tel Aviv and is 51 years old, got his start in real estate when he a student of engineering and management at the <span class="companylink">University of Southern California</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I started working as a property manager of an apartment building when I was at university, and then I managed two more in a rough area of downtown L.A.," he recalls. "Then this guy asked me to find an apartment building that his business partners could buy, and I knew nothing about finding a building, but I did. He made me present it to the partners, and they bought it and gave me a good fee. No paper contracts, nothing. Then I thought, 'Wow, this is great.'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Naftali came to New York in the summer of 2000 and began working for Elad, through knowing Yitzhak Tshuva, the head of the Israeli conglomerate El-Ad Group which owns diverse interests in real estate, tourism and energy. "When I started there it was just two rooms in Fort Lee, N.J.," Mr. Naftali said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elad purchased and redeveloped many properties in TriBeCa, Chelsea and the Upper West Side. But its most well-known project was its upgrade of the Plaza Hotel, which it purchased in 2004, in a deal that valued the property at $675 million. The company spent $450 upgrading the property and converting many of its rooms to condominiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Naftali had to navigate that project through a wide range of controversies involving unions, preservationists and city officials. Some preservationists were critical of the renovation, saying it didn't preserve the character of the storied hotel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Naftali has taken great pride in the project and asks people to take tour of the hotel before forming an opinion about the restoration. After selling more than $1.4 billion worth of condos in the Plaza, Elad sold a controlling stake in the remaining property last year for $570 million to <span class="companylink">India's Sahara Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Naftali says he decided to launch his own company two years ago partly because he wanted to focus on design and development. In 2010, he had taken Elad Properties' Canadian arm, <span class="companylink">Elad Canada</span>, public, then becoming chairman of that company -- a role he didn't relish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I didn't want to be dealing with corporate structures anymore. I want to spend my time focused on creating the product and designing and developing. That's what I like," says Mr. Naftali, who formed his new company with Victor Sigoura, another former Elad executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Naftali's projects include a 12-story residential tower at 200 Franklin St. in Greenpoint, the neighborhood's tallest building. In the last few months, the Naftali Group has closed on nearly 300,000 square feet of prime development sites on the Upper West Side and Gramercy neighborhoods for residential condos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On West 25th Street, Naftali is planning to demolish the existing buildings and develop a tower with 61 units ranging from one to three bedrooms. Some of the properties in the assemblage will be redeveloped as rentals.</p>

</div><div class="author">Esther Fung </div><div>577 words</div><div>18 August 2013</div><div>13:28</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHANGHAI—Fresh evidence of rapidly rising house prices underlined the role a resurgent property sector has played in supporting China's fragile growth, but also raised fears that a sharper correction would be required to bring prices into line with income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices rose an average 6.7% year-over-year in July, up from 6.1% in June, calculations by The Wall Street Journal based on official data released Sunday showed. On a month-to-month basis, the increase in prices moderated slightly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement, National Bureau of Statistics analyst Liu Jianwei said the continued rise in prices is due to genuine home buyer demand as well as recent land price gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sharp increase in lending in the first half of 2013, combined with a quiet relaxation of strict controls on home purchases in some cities, also played a part in boosting sales and pushing prices higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From early 2010 to the beginning of 2013, China's central government tightened property-sector controls, aiming to rein in runaway house prices. But with growth fragile and the real-estate sector a key contributor to demand for everything from steel to furniture, in 2013 policy makers have taken a more relaxed approach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strong sales and rising prices drive higher profits for real-estate developers, encouraging them to break ground on new projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A mixed national picture with strong demand in larger cities and oversupply in smaller cities makes it difficult for the central government to adopt a consistent policy nationwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home prices in major cities like Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou showed the largest gains in July. Export hub Guangzhou in China's southeast recorded the largest year-over-year gain among the 70 cities tracked—a 17.2% increase. On a sequential basis, the increase in prices moderated—up 0.68% month-to-month in July, down from 0.78% in June, calculations showed. Analysts said that would mitigate pressure on the government to tighten its reins on the property cooling campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The eastern Chinese city of Wenzhou—the only major city to consistently post declines in prices—has recently eased restrictions on second home purchases. Wenzhou has been hard hit by the slowdown in China's export sector, and controls on the city's informal financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What I worry about isn't housing prices, but the recent run-up in land prices in major cities, that will pose pressure for developers in terms of profitability," said Jinsong Du, an analyst at <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>. Alongside strong sales and profit growth, some developers including <span class="companylink">China Vanke Co</span>. and <span class="companylink">Agile Property Holdings Ltd</span>. also reported lower margins in the first half.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts generally said that there would be no major policy moves ahead of the Communist Party's annual plenum expected in October. But with rapidly rising house prices contrary to the government's aim of improving affordability, and risking a sharp correction to realign prices with income, tighter controls before the end of the year remain a possibility. If exports to the U.S. and Europe recover, which would put the economy on a stable footing, and the housing sector continues to be frothy, the authorities would not have the same reservations about doling out further measures, Mr. Du said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto and Heather Haddon </div><div>1000 words</div><div>17 August 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A15</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders of modular homes have long battled a perception in New Jersey and New York that their products were aimed at trailer parks, not charming beachfront communities. But since superstorm Sandy smashed homes along the coast, some see an opening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past few months, modular builders say they are seeing an uptick in demand that they hope will translate to long-term business, especially as new federal flood maps and insurance rates force more homeowners to elevate structures. Because many older beach bungalows won't survive being raised, those owners may choose to replace them with new, easy-to-produce modular homes that are fabricated in factories and shipped in sections to the building site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two days after Sandy struck, John Westrum, who has built modular homes primarily in Pennsylvania suburbs, took a helicopter ride to survey the devastation along the Jersey Shore and had an idea: He would take his prefab houses and put them on stilts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Westrum Development</span>'s first elevated modular home is scheduled to open Saturday in Seaside Heights. The two-story, Cape Cod was assembled in 28 days after the local permits were secured and the land was cleared. Former telephone poles were used to lift the first floor about 10 feet above the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although made in Scranton and trucked to New Jersey in four parts, the homes looked typically suburban and had custom features, such as a deck and large windows. At least 40 people are interested in buying one, Mr. Westrum said. He hopes to build 3,000 on the Jersey Shore and "up and down the East Coast."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Architects said the modular-construction industry's improved quality control and ability to use materials in different ways have helped bring its buildings up to design standards in the city. "The day of modular housing is dawning in New York," said Rick Bell, executive director of the American Institute of Architects New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As money trickles in from insurance companies and government, a handful of modular homes on stilts are popping up in some communities in New Jersey, Long Island and Staten Island. Many can be made to evoke beachside bungalows or modernist vacation homes. That has helped allay concerns about identical rows of new, cheap-looking homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It looks beautiful," said Anthony Rusciano, a local 51-year-old utility worker in Seaside Heights who is buying a three-bedroom modular home from Westrum for $179,000. "It went up so fast. I don't have the time or patience to deal with any of this stuff anymore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Modular single-family homes aren't necessarily less expensive than traditional construction, but may save time because they can be built in the factory while owners are waiting for demolition and foundation work. Once the modules are built and transported to the city, it takes a day or two to bolt the pieces into place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of those who lost their home in New York City and Staten Island have yet to start rebuilding, so it is too early to tell if modular homes will be an important part of the rebuilding. New York City has been a tough market to crack because streets are too narrow to maneuver 14-foot wide homes, developers are unfamiliar with the method, and labor unions have resisted because their members are paid less for factory work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least 10 homeowners in Breezy Point are applying for permits for modular construction, according to Arthur Lighthall, general manager of the community co-op in Queens. One house was delivered this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is not a trailer park home. This is a well-designed manufactured home. Side by side to a stick-built home, unless you knew, it'd be hard pressed to figure out which one was which," Mr. Lighthall said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Gerry Romski, who was recently selected by the city to help residents of Breezy and the Rockaways develop new homes said he won't use modular construction due to concerns about quality, fire-resistance and sacrificing interior space to bulkier construction. "We're doing a typical stick-built construction, which we have been doing for the last 25 years," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Colucci, vice president of sales and marketing, <span class="companylink">Westchester Modular Homes Inc</span>., said while New York remains a tough market, he had been building one to two houses a week since the spring for Sandy victims primarily in New Jersey and Long Island. Sales are up 80% over last year, he said, mostly due to Sandy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Colucci, who lived many years ago on the Jersey Shore, said he had a "soft spot" for the wooden bungalows that passed between generations, but he hadn't seen demand to re-create the old.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a certain nostalgia that in my opinion is going to be lost because of the storm. Now it's all about how much can I put into my beach home," he said, including roof decks, outside showers and vinyl siding that resembles cedar shakes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Fehling, a 55-year-old Island Park resident, and his wife, decided to build a modular home seven feet in the air after docks smashed into their 90-year-old wooden house. Their new home took about a week to build in the factory and was delivered from Pennsylvania a month ago. They plan to move in at the end of August, after contractors finish with touches such as radiant heat and fireplaces. He doesn't miss the old place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A house that's almost 90 years old, it's not going to have the insulation. The house was always cold. The house wasn't level," he said. "With the breeze going through the whole house, I don't miss that."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bruce Berkowitz, a mutual-fund manager with a history of bold bets, is doubling down on a risky wager that the government ultimately will sell mortgage giants <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> back to private investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Berkowitz is reopening his $8 billion Fairholme Fund to new investors to look for new investment opportunities, including potentially increasing his stake in Fannie and Freddie, Mr. Berkowitz said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Berkowitz said he continues to believe "Fannie and Freddie are a huge part of the American dream" and that the shares are undervalued. "We haven't found a way to disprove our thesis about Fannie and Freddie," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The comments follow a recent speech by President Barack Obama that was dismissive of the idea of the government again giving over control of Fannie and Freddie to investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Berkowitz, the 53-year-old founder and chief investment officer of Miami-based Fairholme Capital Management, disclosed in June that he held a position in Fannie and Freddie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> have become enormously profitable, buoyed by a federal backstop, an improving housing market and little competition from private investors. Last week, Fannie and Freddie reported second-quarter profits of $10.1 billion and $5 billion respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Preferred shares are generally entitled to a fixed dividend but Fannie and Freddie have not paid one since the government bailed them out. The "S" series of the <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> preferred shares are up more than 180% this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past year, hedge funds and other investors have bid up the shares, once considered worthless. But those are effectively political and legal bets, not financial ones, because Fannie and Freddie's bailout agreement doesn't allow them to pay back the government, meaning they can't emerge from government control without action from Congress or the Treasury.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several investors, including Fairholme, sued the <span class="companylink">U.S. Treasury</span> last month to challenge the government's bailout terms, which allow taxpayers to recoup all of the companies' profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">The Fairholme Fund</span> holds about 6.9% of its portfolio in the two companies, a position valued at $566 million as of May 31, according to the company. The fund, which closed on Feb. 28, will reopen Aug. 19.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Mr. Berkowitz's bet to pay off, he and other investors need one of two things to happen: persuade Congress and the White House to revamp or liquidate Fannie and Freddie in a way that will preserve value for the shares, or win a fight in court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bills introduced in Congress would liquidate the companies as part of a broader mortgage-market overhaul. Last week, President Obama weighed in, saying the country "couldn't have a situation in which the government" would backstop all of the loans made by "these quasi-private institutions, and then if things go wrong, suddenly taxpayers are on the hook."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Each of the major decision makers who has weighed in on this . . . has said emphatically and repeatedly that they will not allow these shareholders to be paid off," said Jim Parrott, a former White House housing adviser. Without a successful legal challenge or "an entirely different set of decision makers," he said, "your bet faces mighty long odds."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Berkowitz said he thinks policy makers will change their minds. "I think common sense will prevail. There's a huge win out there for all constituents -- the taxpayers, homeowners and preferred shareholders."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under mutual-fund regulations, Mr. Berkowitz could invest up to 25% of Fairholme's portfolio each in Fannie and Freddie, although he has no plans to reach that maximum amount as it would require him to reduce his other positions, he said. A more realistic scenario would see him increasing his position to about 5% each of the portfolio, or a total of $800 million based on the value of the shares today, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Berkowitz is no stranger to unpopular bets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He bought into <span class="companylink">American International Group Inc</span>. in the first quarter of 2010, when the insurer was trading in a range of $28 to $35 a share, and when many investors were still shying away from financial stocks. <span class="companylink">AIG</span> was trading late Thursday at about $47. He eventually accumulated a position of 86.1 million shares, making Fairholme Capital Management -- the management company of the Fairholme Fund -- <span class="companylink">AIG</span>'s largest investor as of June 30, according to the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bet didn't initially pay off, and investors pulled billions from the fund as performance plunged. By 2012, as the share prices of <span class="companylink">AIG</span> and other financial stocks rose, the fund rebounded, posting a yearly return of 35.8%, compared with 16% for the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index. Fairholme is up 21% this year through Aug. 14, compared with 19.8% for the S&amp;P 500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the government seized Fannie and Freddie, it agreed to inject vast sums of aid in exchange for a new class of stock -- so called "senior preferred" shares -- that initially paid a 10% dividend. It also received warrants to acquire 80% of the common shares.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto and Josh Dawsey </div><div>842 words</div><div>16 August 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A15</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finding an apartment in Manhattan these days may be tough, but finding a job selling or renting one is getting a little easier, according to a jobs report released Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of jobs in real estate in New York City jumped 2.9% in July compared with the same period last year -- to nearly 122,000 jobs from 118,500 jobs, according to the <span class="companylink">New York state Department of Labor</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rebound puts real-estate jobs near their recent peak of 123,000 in June 2008. Since the beginning of 2009, the number of people employed in real estate in the New York City has hovered around 118,000, before jumping to just over 120,000 in June, according to the Department of Labor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A big reason for the increase is 5% growth in the number of real-estate brokers on both the residential and commercial side, according to the department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential real-estate brokerages said they are hiring brokers to keep up with a strong appetite for rentals and condos. Commercial brokers said they are also seeing an uptick in business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our firm has been on a big hiring spree," said Paul Massey, chief executive of Massey Knakal, which specializes in sales of office and apartment buildings and development sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Massey said the firm has hired about 30 new people in the last six months, and plans to hire another 30 more in the next six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For job seekers, however, landing a coveted spot still isn't easy. "We probably had close to 2,000 applicants for about 30 jobs. It's incredibly competitive," Mr. Massey said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York City's real-estate market has rebounded more quickly than the local economy overall, in part because foreigners have invested in high-price condos, real estate officials say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan residential rents are approaching all-time highs of an average $3,442 a month, according to Citi Habitats, a residential brokerage firm. Condo prices rose 11.4% to nearly $1.9 million on average in the second quarter, according to Jonathan Miller, chief executive of Miller Samuel Inc., a real-estate appraisal firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transaction volume, which tends to drive hiring, was up nearly 19% in the second quarter to more than 3,100 co-op and condo sales in Manhattan, Mr. Miller said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the commercial real-estate side, the market has remained stable. The Manhattan office vacancy rate has hovered around 12% in recent years, though that is still above the 9.7% rate in September 2008, according to Robert Sammons, head of research at <span class="companylink">Newmark Grubb Knight Frank</span>. Asking rents are similarly holding steady at around $59 a square foot, according to Mr. Sammons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall in July, New York private-sector employment grew 2.7% compared with a year earlier, according to the Department of Labor. Sectors that continued to lead the growth were education and health services, and leisure and hospitality. The city's unemployment rate remained the same as last month, at 8.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York state's private-sector job count dipped slightly by 9,200 jobs, over the month to just over 7.4 million. The unemployment rate remained at 7.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the city has added jobs steadily since the recession, sectors such as banking and insurance have been slower to come back. Lower-wage jobs in retail, restaurant and home health-aid jobs have boomed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Salaries in the real-estate industry are on average $66,759 a year, according to a quarterly census of wages produced the New York state and the <span class="companylink">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary Malin, president of Citi Habitats, said people from other industries are trying to jump into real estate because they realize how much money they can make. "The rent market is very high, the sales market is very high, and the environment is very vibrant right now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Malin said his firm launched a new development team in April and is hiring agents across the city, though he declined to specify how many.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts cautioned that while real-estate jobs often offer an appealing landing spot when the market is hot, succeeding in a competitive, commission-based industry can be difficult in an industry subject to the ups and downs of the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're the kind of jobs where when they economy's going well and particularly the real-estate market is really doing well, people really migrate to real-estate in large numbers. There can be real booms and busts," said Jonathan Bowles, executive director of the Center for an Urban Future, a Manhattan-based think tank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allie Blumer, a new broker at Citi Habitats, graduated from Penn State this June and interviewed at several New York firms before choosing Citi Habitats, where she previously was an intern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Blumer, 22, said she closed on a deal in her first week and that "phones and emails have been going nonstop since."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sanette Tanaka   </div><div>485 words</div><div>16 August 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M10</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of all the luxury homes currently for sale, only 1.7% of them are described as dream homes. So Spread Sheet decided to play Sigmund Freud and interpret what "dream" means.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analyzing properties priced at $1 million or above, real-estate listings site HomeFinder.com found that the average dream house in the U.S. costs $2,178,797, measures 5,380 square feet and has four or five bedrooms and 4 1/2 bathrooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most expensive properties described as a "dream house" or "dream home" are found in Hawaii, where homes are listed for $2,955,037, on average, according to HomeFinder.com. Dream homes in New York come next, with an average listing price of $2,631,805.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim Schneider, principal broker at Kukio Properties in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii, says agents in his market reference dream homes "all the time." Using the word dream resonates with second-home buyers who want to get in on the lifestyle, he says. "People love the thought of being on vacation," he says. "We have the palm trees, the ocean breezes, the beautiful sunset -- I think that attracts people when they're daydreaming from their offices in New York."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schneider says he doesn't write "dream house" too often in his listings -- "it's a little whimsical for me," he says -- but he will if a house is exceptional.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has a four-bedroom, 4 1/2-bathroom house on the market with traditional Hawaiian detailing, such as board and batten siding, and lava-rock walls. Those features, combined with the view, prompted his designation as a "Hawaiian dream home." The property is listed for $5.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By and large, agents aren't rushing to call homes a dream. Only 0.65% of property listings in the U.S. are marketed as dream homes, according to the analysis of listings on July 31.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average price for luxury dream homes is high but not astronomical, says Doug Breaker, president and CEO at HomeFinder.com. "These homes are still attainable," he says. "It's used for the midtier of homes that have standout features -- on the waterfront, or two extra bathrooms, or whatever. It's for homes that are slightly above the rest of the homes in their pricing tier."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To Toni Martin, associate broker with Corcoran in Brooklyn, N.Y., properties are dream homes only if they are turnkey and move-in ready.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You often see, 'You can turn this into . . .' or 'This will become . . .' a dream house. That means they're not move-in ready," she says. "You have to come in and your reaction has to be, 'Wow. This home is just beautiful.'"</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">India Bank-Loan Woes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Go From Bad to Worse</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indian banks' loan books are already a problem. But they are going to weaken further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At <span class="companylink">State Bank of India</span>, the country's largest lender by assets, nonperforming loans jumped to 5.7% of the total at June 30 from 5% a year ago. At <span class="companylink">Punjab National Bank</span>, bad loans jumped to 4.8%, from 3.4% a year earlier. <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> says the ratio of NPLs sector-wide will increase from 3.4% in March this year to 3.9% by March 2014 and 4.4% a year later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">India's slowing economy is the main problem. Overall growth slumped to a 10-year low of 5% in the fiscal year ended in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The situation is likely to worsen. The <span class="companylink">Reserve Bank of India</span> forecasts only a slight recovery in the economy in the near term, with growth rising to 5.5% in the current fiscal year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowers will remain under pressure when it comes to servicing debt. <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> says most NPLs so far are at small- and midsize businesses but larger companies will feel the strain, too, as relatively low economic growth persists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worse, a pending rule change could force banks to record more bad loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, the RBI says lenders must record a provision of at least 15% of any loan classified as nonperforming. Alternatively, banks can restructure loans, easing the terms for borrowers, and record a mandated provision of just 2.75% of the loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Naturally, some banks prefer to go the restructuring route, which likely means they are keeping some zombie firms alive, rather than take a bigger hit from downgrading their loans to NPL status. As of March, 5.7% of all loans by India's banks were classified as restructured, compared with 3.4% classified as NPLs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From April 2015, though, the RBI will restrict the restructuring option to a few sectors such as infrastructure. The move could result in a much higher proportion of NPLs across the banking system and a lower proportion of loans being restructured.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">State-owned banks will probably be hardest hit by deteriorating asset quality. They are typically more exposed to risky areas of the economy compared with privately owned banks. At SBI, 28% of loans go to agriculture and small businesses, more than double the proportion at <span class="companylink">ICICI Bank</span>, India's largest private lender.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the banks, India's slowing growth threatens a double whammy. Slowing growth will likely curtail loan growth. At the same time, profitability is sure to take a hit as the existing loan book sours.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House Builders in the U.K.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tumble Off the Ladder</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Too much, too soon. With the rise in U.K. house prices this year, house-building stocks have been on a tear. But the sector dropped 6.2% Thursday on investors' worries about the prospect of a rise in interest rates, which the new Bank of England governor has tied to falling unemployment. While a rate rise would dent still-fragile home-buyer sentiment, there could be gems in Thursday's demolition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conditions have rarely been so good for house builders. Consumer sentiment is improving, while government-backed shared-equity programs have rejuvenated mortgage lending. Whereas first-time buyers were all but locked out of the markets in the wake of the financial crisis, lending to property virgins rose 30% year over year in June, making it the strongest quarter since 2007, according to the Council for Mortgage Lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That suggests transaction volumes, which are still about 40% below peak levels, could start to pick up as each first-time buyer entering the market tends to set off a chain of sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, house prices are rising, while land values aren't. Banks still aren't willing to lend to many of the smaller developers that bid land prices higher precrisis, which has reduced competition in sales. As a result, big listed builders have been adding to their land banks at knockdown prices, which promises years of juiced-up development returns. <span class="companylink">Taylor Wimpey</span> says it has been buying land on which it will make record 20% operating-profit margins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, the ever-rising share prices seen in the first half of the year couldn't stay as a one-way street. At 1.5 times forecast 2013 net asset value, down from a near historic high of 1.7 times on Wednesday, based on <span class="companylink">Numis Securities</span> estimates, house builders' shares still look vulnerable to shocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But investors could be hard pushed to find a better deal elsewhere. For example, <span class="companylink">Taylor Wimpey</span> at 12 times forecast 2014 earnings looks like a good value considering it is expected to generate 27% earnings growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And a slower-growing builder such as <span class="companylink">Berkeley Group Holdings</span> at 11% also offers a nearly 4% dividend yield.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Icahn Distracts Apple From</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What It Should Focus On</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Would Steve Jobs have taken Carl Icahn's call?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of Apple are up about 5% since Mr. Icahn tweeted Tuesday about his fund's new stake in the company and "a nice conversation" he had with Tim Cook, Mr. Jobs's successor as chief executive. Reportedly worth more than $1.5 billion, the stake is big for the activist but not for a tech giant with a market capitalization north of $450 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors are strangely excited, though. Mr. Icahn usually tries to get companies to sell themselves, which is out of the question for Apple. As for his idea that Apple buy back shares more quickly, it looks no more likely to create long-term value for shareholders than hedge-fund manager</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Einhorn's earlier idea to create a new preferred class of shares, backed by a dividend. Rather, both reflect a seemingly pathological hunger for companies paying out more cash on the part of many investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Granted, at $147 billion, Apple sits on too much cash. But it has already announced plans to pay out $100 billion via dividends and share buybacks by the end of 2015. And the pace is brisk already: Last quarter alone, Apple paid out nearly $19 billion. In comparison, <span class="companylink">Exxon Mobil</span> paid out $30 billion in the whole of 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cook knows well that long-term shareholder value rests on investing in great new products, with the next slate due in September. In particular, he needs a new blockbuster as smartphones and tablets running rival <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s Android operating system take ever more market share. Indeed, more exciting than Mr. Icahn's cash call could be Apple's forthcoming watch-like device.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cook has done a reasonable job placating activist investors mainly interested in financial gimmickry. Better to make nice than let them become a distraction. Ultimately, rather than giving some investors what they think they need, Apple's strength lies in giving people what they didn't know they wanted.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Cayne, the longtime chief executive of Bear Stearns, the failed investment bank, is about to list a nearly 5,000-square-foot Park Avenue co-op in Manhattan for $14.95 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The five-bedroom, 5½-bathroom apartment, finished in a contemporary style, is on the sixth floor of a prewar limestone and brick building at 510 Park Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A private elevator opens onto a 20-foot-wide gallery. The 34-foot-long living room, with an oversize modern fireplace and a circular inlaid floor, faces out on Park Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cayne and his wife, Patricia, bought the apartment for $1.1 million in 1981, when Mr. Cayne was a rising star at <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns</span>. The Caynes moved out years ago, and Mr. Cayne said he is selling the co-op because "we don't live there anymore."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cayne became chief executive of Bear Stearns in 1993. In 2006, when his interest in <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns</span> was valued at more than $1 billion, Mr. Cayne and his wife signed a contract to pay $27.4 million for a much larger space on the 14th floor of the Plaza Hotel, which was then in the midst of a partial condominium conversion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time they closed on the 5,900 square feet of space in early 2008, <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns</span> was spiraling toward insolvency, and Mr. Cayne's interest in the firm had shrunk. (When Mr. Cayne sold his stake in the firm his shares were valued at $61 million.) He is remembered in part for being away at a bridge tournament when two <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns</span> hedge funds teetered toward collapse in 2007; Mr. Cayne said that he had been "available at all times."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for Mr. Cayne's unit at 510 Park Avenue, if it sells for near its $14.95 million asking price, it would set a record for sales in the building, agents say. In 2010, a similar apartment on a higher floor sold for $11 million, while a similar unit on a much lower floor in need of extensive renovations sold for $7 million in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cayne's unit has a strong contemporary design: A large study has dark blue walls and furniture, and a horizontal band of lights around the room. The listing notes that the space can be configured with either four or five bedrooms, each with an en suite bath.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cayne, 79 years old, also owns homes in New Jersey and Florida. Dolly Lenz, a top-selling agent and former vice chairman at <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>, who left the firm earlier this year and set up her own company, has the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Film producer and preservationist Michael LaFetra has put a 3,366-square-foot home in Malibu, Calif., on the market for $22 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The five-bedroom, five-bathroom home is considered an important work of architect John Lautner, who is known for his modern, space-age style. The house has a concrete exterior with two curved shell shapes. The interior has floor-to-ceiling glass walls with cedar planking and resembles a modern boat. The living room has two glass walls that slide away, allowing for an open-air view of the ocean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home sits directly on the beach in Malibu's Colony, a guard-gated, star-studded community. It has a large deck that overlooks the Pacific Ocean and views of the Santa Monica Mountains. There's a swimming pool, a sauna with a step-in soaking tub and a painter's studio, which Mr. LaFetra turned into a screening room, also on the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lautner built the home around 1968 for Dan Stevens, a painter. Mr. LaFetra, a preservationist who has bought and sold more than 20 homes in the Los Angeles area, says he purchased the home in 2007 for about $13 million and undertook a restoration of the interior a year later, replacing the cedar planking, restoring concrete materials and bringing back three lofts that were designed, but never fully implemented, in three of the bedrooms. Mr. LaFetra also replicated the original floor tile used in the house and laid it in additional rooms. He installed cork flooring, and solar panels on the roof.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The home is singularly one of the best houses I have experienced, but I've decided to sell because baby-proofing is next to impossible," says Mr. LaFetra, who is on the board of the Los Angeles Conservancy and is planning to start a family. After purchasing this home, Mr. LaFetra nominated it to be landmarked; the state named it a California landmark in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cory Weiss of Partners Trust in Beverly Hills has the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 725-acre property near Paso Robles, Calif., that was once owned by Alex Trebek, host of the TV show "Jeopardy!", has hit the market for $23 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Called Windfall Farms, the property is a thoroughbred breeding and training facility and is one of the only Kentucky-style ones in California. It has a broodmare foaling barn, a yearling barn and a training barn with a six-furlong racetrack. According to its website, the property also has a stallion barn that has been home to many racehorses, including Golden Act and Flying Paster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also a 10,000-square-foot owner's home with four bedrooms, two, four-bedroom guesthouses; and some storage and ranching facilities. There are four wells on the property, grazing pastures and paved roads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Windfall Farms is owned by Santa Paula, Calif.-based <span class="companylink">Limoneira Company</span>, one of the country's largest avocado and citrus growers. The company had planned to create 76, 10-acre residential estates as well as a vineyard, a clubhouse with pool and tennis courts that would coexist with the equestrian facilities. Limoneira says it is selling the property to "monetize a real estate asset we've had in our portfolio for eight years." A new owner would have the right to sell off the 76 parcels that have been subdivided.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In partnership with Dwain Davis, an investment banker, and his family, Limoneira bought the property from Mr. Trebek in 2005 for around $10 million to $15 million, according to Mr. Boyd. Limoneira later took full ownership. Mr. Trebek had owned the property since the mid-1990s, back when it was known as Creston Farms. Mr. Trebek couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cesi Pagano and Tony Taranto of <span class="companylink">Keller Williams Realty</span> have the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Q. Adams Sr., who helped develop the cough-and-cold medicine Mucinex, has put his Colorado ranch on the market for $24.25 million, a 25% price cut from its previous listing price of $32.5 million last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Called Elk River Ranch, the 801-acre property is located just outside Steamboat Springs in the northwestern portion of Colorado. There is a 7,937-square-foot, four-bedroom, seven-bathroom home that was built in 2002 and is set on the bank of the Elk River. Nearby, there is a compound with a four-bedroom, four-bathroom guesthouse of roughly 3,500 square feet; a saloon with a vintage 21-foot-long bar, and pool and poker tables; a homestead house that dates back to the 1800s; and a "honeymoon" cabin with one bedroom, a kitchenette and a bath. There are also several barns and storage facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Adams is now retired. During his career he started four different pharmaceutical companies, including <span class="companylink">Adams Respiratory Therapeutics</span>, the initial maker of Mucinex. He bought the first piece of land that became Elk River Ranch in 2006, amassing smaller parcels in the following years, according to listing broker Brian Smith of Hall and Hall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Smith shares the listing with Pam Vanatta of Prudential Steamboat Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications Santa Paula, Calif.-based <span class="companylink">Limoneira Company</span>, one of the country's largest avocado and citrus growers, says it is selling Windfall Farms, a 725-acre property, to "monetize a real estate asset we've had in our portfolio for eight years." It continues to pursue other real estate projects. An earlier version of this article cited an incorrect assertion by Windfall Farms's general manager that Limoneira was selling the property because it doesn't want to be in the real-estate business anymore. </p>
