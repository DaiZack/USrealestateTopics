</div><div class="author">Eric Morath </div><div>370 words</div><div>15 August 2013</div><div>06:13</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Home builders' confidence levels increased in August to the highest point in nearly eight years, the latest sign the sector could continue to drive the economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>, an industry trade group, said Thursday that its housing-market index increased three points to 59 in August, though the July figure was revised down by one point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This level is the highest since November 2005, marking a rapid climb in recent years. Two years ago the index stood at 15. Readings above 50 indicate that more builders view conditions as good than poor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Builders are seeing more motivated buyers walk through their doors than they have in quite some time," said association Chairman Rick Judson, who is a home builder in Charlotte, N.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added that strengthening home prices and reduced supply are causing "an increased sense of urgency among those who are in the market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The builders' group, however, did fret that tight credit and shortages of land and labor could slow momentum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The improving figures come amid signs that mortgage rates, which jumped by a percentage point during the spring, are leveling off. The average interest rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 4.40% last week according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, virtually unchanged from a week earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some in the real-estate industry fear that if rates did move up significantly, home sales will slow and be a drag on the broader economy, a worry because home building has been an important driver of otherwise lackluster growth so far this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending on residential building contributed 0.38 percentage point to a 1.7% annualized growth rate of gross domestic product in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regionally, the index improved across the country with the exception of the Northeast, where it held flat. The Northeast is the only area where builders still categorize conditions as poor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The August survey is based on responses from 280 builders.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Singapore New Private-Home Sales Plunged in July; Government Measures to Cool Price Growth Damped Market Sentiment</span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SINGAPORE—Sales of new private homes in Singapore plunged in July to the lowest level in more than 3½ years, after recent government curbs on property loans damped investor sentiment and prompted developers to hold back new project launches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property analysts say the slump, which followed two straight months of increasing sales, will likely be followed by more lean months. But they also see transactions eventually recovering as developers and home buyers adapt to the loan curbs, which were implemented in late June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private developers sold 481 new residences in July, down 73% from 1,806 units in June, according to data published Thursday by the <span class="companylink">Urban Redevelopment Authority</span>. This marked a sharp reversal from June, when sales rose 24% after rising 5.4% in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">July's number is the lowest monthly tally since December 2009, when private developers also sold 481 units. In March, a record 2,793 units were sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts say paltry new project offerings from developers were partly to blame. Only five new projects were launched in July compared with eight in June, and sales were "poor," according to property consultancy Knight Frank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Monetary Authority of Singapore</span> imposed the curbs to reduce "imprudent" property-related lending, discouraging lenders from making loans that result in individual home buyers using more than 60% of their monthly incomes to service debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central bank said it was concerned that an eventual rise in interest rates could catch out some home buyers, who may be counting on ultralow rates to continue indefinitely. The U.S. Federal Reserve had signaled in recent months that it could scale down its bond-buying program earlier than expected, thereby slowing capital inflows into Asian economies and resulting in rising interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The decrease in residential launches by developers could be an immediate reaction to the recent [property-loan] measures," said Joseph Tan, executive director for residential at property consultancy CBRE. "Demand was also observed to be more sporadic and this could be attributed to buyers considering over the full effects [of the measures]."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new rules have prolonged loan-processing times by several days, which "dragged the momentum of closing property transactions and impacted sales volume," said Alice Tan, head of consultancy and research at Knight Frank's Singapore arm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central bank's move in June to close loopholes that allowed some homeowners to circumvent loan restrictions and avoid paying levies when buying additional property also had an impact on private home sales, Ms. Tan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Singapore regulators have repeatedly tried to rein in housing prices that have risen almost nonstop since the city-state's economy began recovering from the global financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private-housing price growth has "moderated significantly" since the government measures—including a tough set of controls that went into effect in January—began in September 2009, the Ministry of National Development said this week. But private-housing prices still rose to a record in the second quarter, climbing 1% from the preceding three months and marking the fifth straight quarter of price growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices have surged 61% since the second quarter of 2009, the market's most recent trough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the terms of sales, analysts say volume could remain sluggish, between 500 and 700 units, in August, traditionally a slow month due to the inauspicious Hungry Ghost Festival observed by Singapore's ethnic Chinese majority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to <span class="companylink">Urban Redevelopment Authority</span> data, private developers in Singapore have sold 10,663 new residences in the year to July, about a quarter lower than the number sold in the same period in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales could improve later in the year as "developers would be adopting strategies to address [the affordability] issue in their coming launches," Knight Frank's Ms. Tan said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house nearing completion at 10 Gotham Lane stands alone amid acres of exposed, cracked foundations in a section of Breezy Point where fire destroyed 130 homes during superstorm Sandy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's our hope," Katy Gallagher, who lost her home in the Oct. 29 storm, said of the Gotham Lane house. "I want to paint it hot pink and let it stand out forever and put a big flag on top of it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Breezy Point's burn zone is in a part of the community many residents call the Wedge, and 10 Gotham Lane is the only building there anywhere close to be ready to be lived in. Several other homeowners have obtained building permits, but they are likely months away from finishing construction. Some leaders and homeowners in Breezy Point, where all the homes are owned by a cooperative, said they had been stymied by city and federal rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's at times very frustrating when you meet a roadblock, a wheel of bureaucracy. You're put through a drawn-out process of facing a bunch of objections to what you've submitted," said Arthur Lighthall, general manager of the private community's cooperative. "They have rules and regulations, they have codes, they have zoning. The system makes it very difficult for anyone to maneuver around it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few spots in the region were hit as hard by Sandy, with about 350 of 2,800 homes across Breezy Point destroyed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many had to wait a long time for permits because their homes were in areas that old city maps showed as streets -- even though the streets were never built. Therefore, they faced an intensive Boards of Standards and Appeals process. Others said they delayed building for months because they wanted first to see new federal flood maps that guide building standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 60 people cooperative officials have helped in the entire neighborhood, about 10 have satisfied the city's requirements, Mr. Lighthall said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's all taken longer than we ever thought it would," said Pat Pinto, whose home in the Wedge burned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The process went smoother for Sue Flynn, who owns the 10 Gotham Lane home, because she had been authorized to move in last summer -- shortly before Sandy struck -- and so had architect plans and current permits. "Even before the storm, getting permits was a big hassle," said Ms. Flynn, whose primary home is in New Jersey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City officials cite a number of factors that have affected the pace of rebuilding in the Wedge. It took time to determine home values -- required for permitting -- because the city taxes the cooperative as a whole, and the homeowners pay the cooperative their property taxes. The neighborhood's signature stock of beach bungalows and cottages, many decades old, was largely not up to current building codes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York state has also tried to alleviate some of the worries, as Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed a bill in July to ease permitting for the residents. City officials say they now expect the process to speed up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're frustrated [along] with them," Brad Gair, director of the city's housing recovery, said of Breezy Point residents. "It's not because anyone is doing anything wrong. But it's the way government helps is very compartmentalized at times. The biggest challenge when it comes to Breezy Point is they don't have a long-standing relationship of dealing with the city. It's been a matter of us winning them over."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gair said the city would like to help Breezy Point to become more modern and able to withstand big storms. The proposals included dumping fill to lift the entire neighborhood -- which would mean new houses in the Wedge wouldn't have to be raised quite so much. The city also wanted to build new, protective dunes and considered switching the area from septic tanks to a sewer system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Lighthall shot down some of those ideas: "This community will always consist of individual one- and two-story houses. That's what we want to see. We are not interested in new development and major changes. We are not interested in new infrastructure," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lighthall said the cooperative would consider city efforts to repair sidewalks or install streetlights but was skeptical of a city-built dune or sewer system. "Our point in the whole matter is we have people who need to have their homes rebuilt," he said. The cooperative was concerned it would take too long to hook up to a sewer system -- the city eventually deemed it too costly -- and discussions now center on the creation of a centralized septic system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, residents continue to work through the process, with many helping each other complete government forms. Many are older widows who said they had lived in five or more places since the storm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Catherine Brennan and Mary Welsome, widows whose homes were wiped out by Sandy, now live together elsewhere in Breezy Point, with furniture they borrowed from relatives. They said they rescued virtually nothing from their former homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The FEMA man would ask me about my insurance papers, and I would tell him they were burned, and he would keep talking," Ms. Brennan said. "Then, he'd ask me about my papers again. And I said, 'What don't you understand? My house was burned to the ground. Nothing is there. Nothing is standing.'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Federal Emergency Management Agency spokesman said the agency was mindful of the loss of important documents in a disaster and gave homeowners tips on replacing them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Brennan and Ms. Welsome, along with other older women they know who once lived on their own in the Wedge, debate when the neighborhood will return. Ms. Welsome, the most optimistic of the bunch, hopes for a burst of construction activity by winter. City and cooperative officials aim for the same. Some of the women laughed at the idea they would be back before next summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The outside is up," said Ms. Flynn of her Gotham home. "But I don't know when the inside will be up. One thing I've learned through Sandy is you can't put a time frame on any of it."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Erica E. Phillips </div><div>848 words</div><div>14 August 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ONTARIO, Calif. -- At a 500,000-square-foot warehouse here, newly arrived shipments of New Balance shoes whiz down conveyor belts and spiral chutes to be scanned, sorted, packed into larger boxes and shipped to far-flung destinations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New Balance distribution center, located about 40 miles east of Los Angeles in a Southern California region known as the Inland Empire, is one of a rising number of large-scale warehouses into which local governments and developers have placed their hopes for an economic renaissance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banking on the desert region's proximity to the nation's busiest ports and major freeways, industrial real-estate companies are gobbling up vast parcels of land to build logistics hubs for big-box and online retailers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"From here you can pick your poison," says Tyson Chave, vice president at industrial real-estate developer -- and New Balance's landlord -- <span class="companylink">Prologis Inc</span>. Mr. Chave calls the nearby sweeping, multilevel freeway interchange of the I-10 and I-15 freeways, "Main and Main."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But much of the new construction is speculative, meaning developers are looking for tenants even as the walls are raised on new buildings. Prologis, for example, just completed an 800,000-square foot warehouse in Redlands, Calif., that has yet to be leased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speculative development was the rage in all commercial real-estate sectors before the economic downturn. But developers of office buildings, shopping centers and most other property types have been slow to return to this high-risk strategy, primarily because they can't obtain debt financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers of distribution facilities have been the first to plunge back into the speculative pool. They can do this partly because their projects are less expensive than office towers or malls, and they can finance them without taking out big loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Inland Empire, which handles about 75% of the goods imported through the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, is the extreme example of this trend. Of the 13.8 million square feet of warehouse space under construction in the Inland Empire, over 68% is speculative, according to analysis by commercial real-estate services firm Cushman &amp; Wakefield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By comparison, the Dallas-Fort Worth area, the second-largest region for industrial development, has 10.6 million square feet under construction, 40% of which is speculative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Inland Empire, developers are taking a gamble in a region that is at the mercy of trends in global trade beyond its control. For example, the expanded capacity of the Panama Canal -- scheduled for completion in 2015 -- threatens Southern California's import volumes, as larger ships will be able to bypass the region for other ports. The Los Angeles and Long Beach ports handled 14.1 million containers in 2012, accounting for more than 40% of the total number imported to the U.S. annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If there's any region that has the most to lose, it's definitely Southern California and the Inland Empire," says Ferdinando Guerra, an economist with the <span class="companylink">Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the Inland Empire still has much ground to make up since the recession. The region set records nationally in foreclosures, falling home values and unemployment, which hit 14.6% in January 2010. The amount of surplus warehouse and distribution space soared to 36 million square feet at the end of 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as the economy recovered and demand increased for consumer goods, much of that space was absorbed. The first green shoots of speculative development began appearing in the Inland Empire as early as 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regional economists are optimistic. They point out that growth in imports has coincided in recent years with a retailer trend toward larger warehouse facilities, which are believed to improve supply-chain efficiency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, as online retail grows, regions such as the Inland Empire are filling up with so-called e-commerce fulfillment centers, where online orders get filled and shipped. <span class="companylink">Amazon.com Inc</span>. in late July announced it was hiring 5,000 full-time jobs in 17 fulfillment centers across the U.S., including a 951,000-square-foot facility in San Bernardino, Calif., that opened last fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The region's convenience and relatively low rental rates have recently attracted companies including <span class="companylink">Home Depot Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Samsung Electronics Co</span>., <span class="companylink">Bayerische Motoren Werke AG</span> and <span class="companylink">Best Buy Co</span>. Vacancy rates in the region have fallen to 5.4% so far this year from more than 9% in 2009, according to research by real-estate services firm <span class="companylink">CBRE Group Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say the expanding industrial real-estate market may lift other parts of the economy and local governments hard hit by the downturn. Last year, for example, the city of San Bernardino entered bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim Morris, chief of staff for San Bernardino's mayor, says the new <span class="companylink">Amazon.com</span> facility will provide an average of 1,200 jobs, and another e-commerce facility that opened in 2010 has added about 500 jobs.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Robbie Whelan </div><div>1708 words</div><div>14 August 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OAKLAND, Calif. -- On a recent weekday morning, a crew was busy sprucing up the exterior of Koonal Parmar's one-story house in West Oakland. They trimmed trees, pressure-washed the wood siding and touched up his paint job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Parmar didn't pay a dime for all this. The upgrades were compliments of REO Homes LLC, an investment firm that owns several houses on Mr. Parmar's block. In addition to helping homeowners upgrade their homes, REO has mended fences and planted hundreds of trees along city streets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The neighborhood was badly in need of capital, to maintain, beautify and restore it," said REO founder Neill Sullivan, while driving his hybrid sedan through the streets of West Oakland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company's motives aren't altruistic. They are part of a broader strategy designed to upgrade the neighborhood to attract higher-income residents who, in turn, will help boost properties' values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In past housing recoveries, investors purchased foreclosed homes and often tried to flip them for a quick profit. But investors with a different approach have plunged into the housing market this time. They have assembled billions of dollars to acquire homes and upgrade them. Their aim is to gentrify communities and profit later when rents and property values rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're taking mostly vacant, abandoned and beat up housing stock, fixing it up and putting livable, quality housing on the market," Mr. Sullivan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gentrification of low- and middle-income urban neighborhoods is nothing new. But economists and scholars say the current process is moving faster than in the past, which can be unsettling to people who lost their homes or who are being displaced by fast-rising rental rates and home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It can take generations for neighborhoods to change, but investors have the potential to accelerate the process, especially because they may have the cash on hand to purchase lots of homes at once, even in tight credit markets," said Ingrid Gould Ellen, co-director of <span class="companylink">New York University</span>'s Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These efforts aren't occurring everywhere. In cities far away from vibrant employment centers or where crime and unemployment are high, vast tracts of housing remain abandoned. But in working-class communities in or near Washington, New York, Boston, Los Angeles and San Francisco -- where employment is relatively strong and housing costs are high -- big investors have become an active part of the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Virginia Tech professor Derek Hyra, who is writing a book about the gentrification of Washington's historically black, largely low-income Shaw/U Street neighborhood, said while the gentrification process has been moving slowly for decades, it sped up in late 2009 and early 2010, due partially to rising foreclosures. "You see doggy day-cares popping up in the U Street area, which is sort of unbelievable," Mr. Hyra said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate firms say they need to spiff up neighborhoods to make their investments pay off. The MACK Cos., is a rental landlord that operates in the Chicago market and owns about 400 homes and manages about 1,400 homes owned by larger investment firms. Six months ago, it paid $165,000 for a house in Midlothian, Ill., near a country club, which sat on a street filled with potholes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After local officials failed to repair the road, MACK decided to spend $20,000 to repave the block in front of the home, which is expected to rent for about $3,300 to $3,500 per month. Jim McClelland, MACK's chief executive, said the company buys most of its homes, which are all bank-owned foreclosures, for around $50,000. It then spends an average of $43,000 on interior renovations for each house, and an average of $9,700 on exterior improvements, including grooming driveways and planting trees in medians on the street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If your play is for long-term appreciation, versus just flipping the houses, wouldn't you want to improve the properties and make the area more desirable?" Mr. McClelland asked. "It creates a look of curb appeal. It's good for business."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some veteran landlords disagree. "Renters can only afford to pay up to a certain amount. Spending extra money to not only improve the house, but also the neighborhood wouldn't result in enough of a rent increase to be cost-justifiable," said Michael Meyer, chairman of TwinRock Partners, a real-estate firm in Newport Beach, Calif., that owns roughly 250 single-family rental homes in Southern California and Las Vegas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because homes prices are rising faster than rents, Mr. Meyer said he is only getting a 5% to 6% annual return on his most recent purchases. Spending more to improve the neighborhood wouldn't be "economically viable," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few places highlight how investors are hastening gentrification as well as Oakland, a port city on the San Francisco Bay with a long history of labor and political activism. The city's working-class black population swelled after World War II as families relocated from the South to seek work in Oakland's shipbuilding and food-processing industries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the years, Oakland has been the scene of numerous dockworker strikes and in 1966 became home to the Black Panther Party, a black militant organization. Crime skyrocketed during the crack-cocaine epidemic of the 1980s, and the city's reputation suffered despite its proximity to some of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As crime has fallen in recent years a technology industry boom has lifted the Bay Area economy, and real-estate brokers have positioned Oakland as a more affordable option to San Francisco, a few miles away. The average asking rent for a one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco rose 39.4% to $2,797 between the second quarter of 2009 and the second quarter of 2013, according to RealFacts LLC, a real-estate data provider. Oakland's rental market is rising, but it remains comparatively cheap. Over the same period, one-bedroom asking rents rose 31.2%, to $1,839 from $1,402.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices also are significantly cheaper in Oakland, although they are rising faster than in San Francisco. The estimated median sales price in the Oakland area was $450,180 in June, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>, a real-estate data provider, up 25.7% from a year ago. In the San Francisco area the estimated median price was $773,473, up 21% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the housing crash, investors pounced on Oakland. In 2006, absentee buyers and buyers making cash purchases -- another sign they are investors -- made up 10.6% and 5.7% of the market respectively, according to DataQuick, a housing analytics company. By 2012, the absentee buyer share had risen to 30.5%, and the cash-buyer share had risen to 33.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A study conducted last year by the <span class="companylink">Urban Strategies Council</span>, an advocacy organization based in Oakland, found that between 2007 and 2011, 10,508 homes in the city went through foreclosure, and 42% were acquired by investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the biggest investors to seize on the opportunity was Mr. Sullivan's REO Homes. With the help of an early investment from Thomas Steyer, the founder of San Francisco-based hedge-fund firm <span class="companylink">Farallon Capital Management LLC</span>, REO has acquired more than 200 homes in Oakland since REO was founded in 2008. Most are in West Oakland, known for its stately Victorian homes and located just one stop from San Francisco on the local commuter rail line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the five-block radius around Mr. Parmar's house, REO owns around 20 homes, Mr. Sullivan said. Most houses cost around $200,000 and Mr. Sullivan said he invests as much $100,000 to fix each one up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Parmar welcomes the investor-driven gentrification. The 39-year-old musician and youth soccer coach purchased his home in West Oakland for $302,000 in 2004, when the neighborhood was, as he said, "very marginal."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing crash made things worse. By 2007, Mr. Parmar's home was worth $125,000. Similar-sized houses in the neighborhood have sold in recent months for more than $370,000, Mr. Parmar said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Parmar said that since investors started buying up blighted properties in the neighborhood, drug dealers have stopped selling on a corner near his house, neighbors have started taking better care of their houses' appearances, local residents have set up a neighborhood watch group on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and a once-dangerous park nearby has reopened for weekly youth soccer practices and softball games.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also points to new, trendy restaurants and a brewery that have opened recently nearby, and said that the neighborhood is getting younger and more ethnically diverse as more-affluent white and Asian renters move in. "This neighborhood has turned around 180 degrees," said Mr. Parmar. "The people who were living here for 30 years were just letting the neighborhood rot."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That isn't the way many longtime residents see it. A few blocks away, Jo Anne Stamps, 61, a retired administrative assistant, lives with her 96-year-old mother in a home that has been in her family for more than 40 years. She said the new renters who have come in over the past few years keep to themselves and don't participate in neighborhood traditions like the annual block party. "When mom moved in, people were more friendly," Ms. Stamps said. "Everybody knew everybody. It made me feel safer."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The changes in the community also worry Oakland city officials. They are advancing various initiatives designed to slow down investor purchases and give owner-occupiers a chance to buy foreclosed properties before investors see them as part of a federally funded "First Look" program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm not interested in finding housing for San Franciscans who can no longer afford San Francisco. I'm interested in helping people here in Oakland," said Desley Brooks, the council member who sponsored city legislation requiring investors to record their property holdings in a city registry to slow down purchases. "There are people here who have lived here their whole lives who can no longer afford Oakland."</p>

</div><div class="author">By William A. Galston </div><div>844 words</div><div>14 August 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A9</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given all the praise that Americans and their political leaders have for homeownership, the U.S. record has been comparatively unimpressive. A recent survey of homeownership rates in 42 countries (all the members of the <span class="companylink">Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development</span> and <span class="companylink">European Union</span>, plus Singapore) found that the U.S. ranks 34th. Countries such as Canada have achieved higher homeownership than the U.S. with lower levels of default, taxpayer exposure and systemic risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The centerpiece of the Canadian system is mortgage insurance that imposes strict criteria on borrowers and requires private capital to bear the first tranche of losses before the public backstop kicks in. A bipartisan bill drafted by Sens. Bob Corker (R., Tenn.) and Mark Warner (D., Va.), and recently endorsed in principle by President Obama, broadly tracks the Canadian model.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would phase out Fannie and Freddie, with private financial institutions taking their place. The government could back the securities that private lenders issue in return for a fee, but private lenders would be required to absorb a loss of 10% before the public insurance is triggered. A new independent agency, the Federal Mortgage Insurance Corporation, would enforce the rules, insure eligible securities, and draw on the fee-based insurance fund in case of catastrophe, much as the FDIC does for insured deposits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corker-Warner would not be cost-free. Mark Zandi of <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics calculates that the increased private capital reserves the legislation makes necessary would increase interest rates for average borrowers by 50-75 basis points -- about $75 per month, enough to price some would-be borrowers out of the market. In 15 years, after the insurance fund builds up to adequate levels, this would shrink to about 35-55 basis points, according to Mr. Zandi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Corker-Warner has received a favorable reception in many quarters, some liberal legislators and activists remain worried that getting rid of Fannie and Freddie will fatally weaken policies that promote affordable housing. Others on the left acknowledge that Fannie and Freddie cannot be sustained, but they want much stronger affordable-housing funding and guarantees in return for their elimination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the right, many conservative think-tanks and elected officials insist that, as much as possible, the government should get out of the conventional mortgage business. That means not only shutting down Fannie and Freddie, but also not providing backstop public insurance guarantees against catastrophic loss. Last month, the <span class="companylink">House Financial Services Committee</span>, led by chairman Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas), approved the Protecting America's Taxpayers and Homeowners (PATH) Act, which closely tracks the conservative critique.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analyzing the PATH proposal, Mr. Zandi identified some important advantages over current policy. PATH would increase incentives for prudent mortgage lending and would insulate taxpayers against the costs of future bailouts. But the downsides are considerable: Access to 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages would be significantly diminished. Interest rates for average borrowers would increase by 90 basis points; and the mortgage-backed securities market would be vulnerable to "investor runs" during times of financial stress, just as banks experienced depositor runs before the creation of the FDIC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage has been the mainstay of the U.S. housing market for decades, and no doubt Mr. Obama speaks for the public in insisting, as he did recently, that it must remain so. But this kind of mortgage, which is unusual by world standards, contains credit and interest-rate risks that few private investors would be willing to take on at anything like current rates -- unless there is some kind of public catastrophic insurance. That is the logic behind Corker-Warner, and that is why this proposal should be the point of departure for the efforts to reform housing finance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics of the Corker-Warner approach must decide whether they want a bill or an argument. If the left is willing to accept the phaseout of Fannie and Freddie, it can probably negotiate strengthened affordable-housing guarantees. (A letter to Messrs. Corker and Warner from the <span class="companylink">Center for American Progress</span> and two dozen housing and civil-rights groups would serve as a good basis for these talks.) If the right is willing to acknowledge, as Alan Greenspan famously did during the financial crisis, that markets are not perfectly self-regulating, then a House-Senate conference could probably negotiate a backstop public-insurance guarantee that minimizes the risks of political manipulation and taxpayer exposure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are real trade-offs, and the public deserves to know what they are. Conservatives who want to shrink government and eliminate taxpayer risk should acknowledge the consequences: diminished access to 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages for the middle class and to affordable housing for low-income families. Moderates and liberals who want to preserve government's backstop role should acknowledge that taxpayer risk has been reduced, but not ended. Then Congress can decide between the Corker-Warner and Hensarling approaches without further weakening public trust in government.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHANGHAI—The eastern Chinese city of Wenzhou has eased restrictions on purchases of second homes, suggesting a slight loosening of property-market controls as the economy shows slower growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The change is seen as significant because past price jumps had caused Wenzhou to maintain stricter property curbs than most cities. A center of private business and once a hotbed of real-estate speculation, it imposed curbs on second-home purchases in 2011 as other cities were generally restricting purchases of third homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wenzhou housing-bureau spokeswoman Zhuang Li said a report in the local Wenzhou Dushibao newspaper that second-home purchases are now permitted is accurate. According to the report, the restriction was lifted because prices have been kept at reasonable levels since the second half of last year, and the property sector still has a role in driving the economy. Wenzhou has posted year-on-year declines in housing prices every month since August 2011—alone among the 70 cities included in the official price survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beijing has maintained property-market controls for nearly four years in a bid to keep prices from spiraling higher and triggering social unrest. For home buyers, curbs include limits on credit and higher down-payment requirements; for developers, they include restrictions on stock and bond offerings and on bank borrowing—though banks can still lend to financially stronger clients and for low-income housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some cities have been permitted to fine-tune the curbs—such as by making the credit environment more accommodative and so allowing more home seekers to buy—the city of Foshan in 2011 abandoned a bolder plan to ease home-purchase limits, under pressure from the central government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with China's economy slowing, the real-estate sector—a major contributor to economic growth—may now be seen by policy makers in a more favorable light.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Craig Karmin </div><div>1017 words</div><div>13 August 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private-equity firm <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span> is making one of the biggest bets on rental apartments since the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New York firm has agreed to buy majority stakes in 80 apartment complexes from the financing arm of <span class="companylink">General Electric Co</span>. in a deal that values the portfolio at $2.7 billion, according to people familiar with the agreement. The apartment buildings, with roughly 30,000 units, are in Dallas, Atlanta and other parts of Texas and the Southeast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It isn't clear how much equity <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> is putting up for the transaction, but it is expected to be close to $1 billion, these people said. A spokesman for Blackstone and a spokeswoman for GE declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the investment, <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> is wading into a debate in the real-estate-investment world over the future of the rental market. Apartment buildings have been the hottest real-estate sector since the downturn because of strong demand from people unable or unwilling to buy homes. Rents and occupancy rates have been rising while the prices investors have been paying for apartment complexes have moved into record territory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in recent months, some analysts and investors have begun to worry that the party is coming to an end. They have warned that the recovery of the single-family-home market will erode demand for apartments and that competition is increasing from new supply being developed in many parts of the country. "I would expect multifamily rent growth to begin decelerating because of the new construction," said Tad Philipp, director of Moody's Investors Service's commercial-real-estate research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some big-name investors believe that the outlook remains bright. Earlier this year, <span class="companylink">AvalonBay Communities</span> and Sam Zell's <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> paid $6.5 billion in cash and stock to <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc</span>. for <span class="companylink">Archstone Inc</span>. That deal, which valued Archstone at $16 billion, including debt, was closely watched partly because auditors cited Lehman's investment in Archstone as a big contributor to that firm's bankruptcy filing in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment sector is being boosted in part because most of the recent job growth has benefited people 34 years old and younger, according to Richard Campo, chief executive of Camden Property Trust, a Houston-based real-estate investment trust that owns and operates apartment buildings. "Those are our customers," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors who purchased apartment buildings early in the downturn have enjoyed sharp increases in value. <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> apartment index, which tracks the national average price of multifamily rental buildings, is up 59% from its 2009 lows, compared with a 35% gain for its National All Property Index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in values has been propelled by rent increases of 2.3% in 2010, 2.4% in 2011 and 3.8% in 2012, according to <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>., a property-research firm. Vacancy rates, which hit a 30-year high at 8% in 2009, are now at 4.3%, a 12-year low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Houston, for example, average apartment rents increased to $799 a month in the second quarter, up 4.4% from the second quarter of 2012. In Seattle, rents were up 6.2% in the same time frame to $1,096.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big question now hanging over the market is whether or not these trends will continue to push values higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past year, investors in real estate investment trusts have been getting increasingly wary. The compounded return for the apartment sector declined 3.23% in the past 12 months, compared with an 8.76% increase for all equity REITs, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But others point to a number of market forces that could keep renters in place longer than they otherwise stay during an economic recovery. Despite low mortgage rates, many would-be homeowners are finding that they can't qualify for a mortgage because lending standards remain tight or because they don't have enough regular employment to qualify for a loan. Others have dings on their credit or have struggled to save for a down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the supply of homes for sale remains constrained, putting a crimp on sales. While home prices have been rising, they still are down sharply from their 2006 peak in many parts of the country and many owners have been unwilling to sell at these levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors bullish on the rental apartment sector also note that lending is plentiful thanks to <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, which have been providing financing to owners of apartment buildings. Buyers of other kinds of commercial real estate have had a more difficult time getting loans for their deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Campo said that while construction of apartment building is picking up, it slowed considerably during the downturn when new supply fell from an average of 250,000 units a year to 75,000 units a year in 2009 and 2010. Builders are only now starting to address that imbalance, says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It will take at least three or four years to fill that deficit," Mr. Campo said. "Everything today is being built to meet new demand."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>'s apartment purchase from <span class="companylink">General Electric</span> is its largest U.S. real estate investment in two years, as it continues to buy from a record $13.3 billion global real-estate fund it recently raised.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past couple of weeks, <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> has gotten attention for its plans to sell high-profile property and hotel companies. The New York firm recently tapped four banks to prepare <span class="companylink">Hilton Worldwide Inc</span>. for what could be a multibillion-dollar public offering, and it has taken steps to sell or take public two other hotel companies and a retail-property company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the property market, <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>'s latest major acquisition shows that one of the biggest private-equity firms isn't making a one-directional bet.</p>

</div><div class="author">Simon Nixon </div><div>1126 words</div><div>12 August 2013</div><div>05:34</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no spectacle so ridiculous as the British establishment in one of its periodic fits of virtue, as the great Victorian historian Thomas Macaulay didn't quite say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For much of the past five years, the U.K. economic debate has followed a familiar pattern. Whenever the economy hits the rocks following one of its periodic house-price booms, the establishment's first response is to suck its teeth and sternly inform the public that it must end its foolish addiction to debt-fueled spending and adjust to a more virtuous economic model built around investment and exports—no matter what the cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, once the cost becomes apparent, virtue is swiftly abandoned. Interest rates are cut, the pound is devalued, the public is exhorted to borrow and spend. House prices pick up, people feel richer and a pleasing new cycle gets under way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Treasury chief George Osborne, the inflection point was reached earlier this year. With hopes of an export- and investment-led recovery fading, he reverted to the tried and tested formula of seeking to engineer a house-price boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his March budget, he announced Help-To-Buy, a package of new subsidies designed to encourage banks to provide riskier mortgages. That followed the appointment of Mark Carney as Bank of England governor with a brief to find imaginative new ways to increase lending without worrying too much about short-term inflation. Last week, Mr. Carney duly obliged by signaling the BOE was unlikely to raise interest rates for three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's hard to find anyone with a good word to say about Mr. Osborne's strategy, including among Treasury and BOE officials, independent economists and his own party colleagues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conventional wisdom is that the U.K. private sector needs to pay down debt, not be encouraged to borrow more. Although some deleveraging has taken place, household debt is still historically high at 140% of gross domestic product compared with 100% in 2000, while real incomes have fallen for six consecutive years. House prices may be as little as 4% below their peak before the financial crisis, based on figures from the <span class="companylink">Office of National Statistics</span>, according to Fathom Consulting. The ratio of house prices to income has fallen from six times to 4.4 times, but it is still above its long-term average of three times income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That said, it's possible to make a respectable case for what Mr. Osborne is up to. The housing market was clearly being held back by new bank-capital rules that made it very expensive for banks to offer high-loan-to-value mortgages. Never mind that these capital charges were deliberate or that some policy makers, including Prime Minister David Cameron, had suggested capping loan-to-value ratios; the reduction in average loan-to-value ratios for first-time buyers from 90% to 80% was making it hard for creditworthy borrowers to obtain loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the traditional role that housing plays in the U.K., this stagnation in the housing market was a drag on consumer confidence and was depressing domestic demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Osborne is gambling that rising house prices will raise confidence, with a consumer-led recovery broadening into a revival in business investment and ultimately exports—the opposite of the previously anticipated virtuous circle. Crucially, he is also betting that there is sufficient slack in the economy that this growth can be accompanied by noninflationary wage growth so that stretched household debt ratios can fall back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are even tentative signs that Mr. Osborne's strategy is working. House prices are up 4% since the start of this year, according to the lender Nationwide, reflecting a collapse in mortgage rates since the Treasury and BOE last year introduced the Funding for Lending Scheme, which offered banks cheap loans if they increased their domestic lending. Some banks are now offering fixed rates of just 1.5%. And banks are once again offering high-loan-to-value mortgages in anticipation of January's launch of the next stage of Help to Buy, which will see the Treasury guarantee banks against losses on the first 20% of loans with loan-to-value ratios of up to 95%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, surveys show that confidence is indeed spreading to other parts of the economy, with industrial production rising. By the end of 2014, house prices could have risen by 15% with the economy growing by more than 2%, according to <span class="companylink">Berenberg Bank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are three ways the Treasury's bet could turn sour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first is if the consumer-led recovery falters without a sustained pickup in investment and export-driven growth. This is a material risk since there is only so far the releveraging of the household sector can run as it adjusts to lower interest rates and higher loan-to-value ratios. Much depends on the willingness of first-time buyers to pay current high prices; transaction volumes are still very low. If the recovery does peter out, all the Treasury will have achieved is to encourage households to dive deeper into debt, requiring an even bigger adjustment in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second risk is that the economy does recover but not in the benign way that Mr. Osborne hopes. In other words, growth picks up but productivity remains weak: The Treasury and BOE may be underestimating the damage to the productive potential of the economy caused by the crisis and six years of low investment. If firms have to hire more workers to meet new demand, then faster growth could lead to higher inflation, forcing the BOE to raise interest rates. Mr. Osborne's house-price boom would turn to bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The third risk is that the BOE steps in to cool the housing market before the recovery has had time to pick up steam. Mr. Carney last week repeated the boom-era mantra that the Monetary Policy Committee doesn't target asset prices. But he also noted that the BOE's new Financial Policy Committee, which he also heads and which is charged with maintaining financial stability, may take a less relaxed view. If house prices rose 15% over the next year driven by a sharp rise in risky high-loan-to-value mortgage lending, public pressure on the committee to respond could be intense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The British establishment's past pretenses at virtue may have looked ridiculous. But ominously for Mr. Osborne, postcrisis a degree of virtue has—at least in theory—been hard-wired into the system.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Conor Dougherty </div><div>782 words</div><div>9 August 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cities in the West and the Sunbelt, among the hardest hit during the real-estate downturn, continue to lead the nation's housing recovery -- posting double-digit gains in home prices that have outpaced even the most optimistic projections from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the second quarter, median existing-home prices increased in 142 of the 163 metropolitan areas tracked by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>, according to a survey released Thursday. Among the 10 cities with the fastest year-over-year price growth, nine were in California, Florida or Nevada -- states that were hammered by the grinding real-estate bust that persisted from 2007 until last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the biggest standouts were in California. The Sacramento area led the nation with a 39.2% increase in year-over-year prices. The San Francisco and Los Angeles metropolitan areas also were in the top 10 in terms of home-price gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While formerly hard-hit places are thriving, the entire U.S. housing market is far better off than it was a year ago. Nationally, the median existing-home price rose 12.2% in the second quarter from a year ago, to $203,500. That was the strongest year-over-year gain since 2005, during the throes of the pre-recession real-estate bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fastest growth was the West, with 18.2% price growth, followed by the South (11.0%), the Midwest (7.9%) and the Northeast (6.9%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was as an average of 5.1 months worth of existing home supply in the second quarter, down from 6.4 months in the second quarter a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The turnaround has been driven by better job growth and a tight supply of homes for sale. There also has been a reduction in the number of foreclosures, which drag on prices. Homes sold under financial duress, such as a foreclosure or short sale, accounted for 17% of second quarter sales, down from 26% a year ago, according to the realtors' group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From quarter to quarter, the survey can be unreliable because it measures median prices and can result in overstated gains and losses as the mix of homes shifts between the higher and lower ends of the market. That likely is happening now, as there are fewer lower-end homes, such as foreclosure sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists and housing analysts expect prices to continue rising. Many of the driving factors, such as tight supply, fewer foreclosures and pent-up demand from buyers who sat out the market during the past few years, are unlikely to turn around soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventory, while still tight, has started to edge up as more homeowners, enticed by higher prices, put their homes for sale. Interest rates, while still low, are rising. And investors, whose mostly cash purchases were the spark that ignited the housing rebound, are starting to pare back their purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, a number of peripheral housing indicators are already showing a slowdown. Asking prices fell 0.3% in July, the first month-over-month decline since November of last year according to a report released earlier this week by <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, a real-estate listing site. Meanwhile, Redfin, a national real-estate brokerage, reported that the number of people taking home tours fell slightly in June. This may foreshadow a long-expected slowdown in price growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the supply-starved West, the heady competition among buyers is prompting prospective buyers to put off vacations so they can continue house-hunting in the summer months when traffic typically tails off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They can be ready to act and jump on any property that comes on," said Jordan Clarke, a San Diego-based Realtor with Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many shoppers are taking unusually personal measures to stand out from the pack. Two of Mr. Clarke's clients, David Larson and Janna Alfery, recently closed on a four-bedroom, $1.15 million home in Encinitas, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The early 30s couple had been looking for a home for three months and in that time looked at roughly 50 places, they said. To get the home they live in now, they wrote the sellers a personal letter that, among other things, noted the coincidence that they are both doctors and the home was on Hygeia Avenue, named for the daughter of the Greek god of medicine. Later, they had a wine-and-cheese gathering with the sellers and even introduced them to Mr. Larson's parents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The offer still almost fell through when a rival buyer offered $100,000 more, but that bid eventually fell through.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It felt like miracle," Mr. Larson said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Molly Hensley-Clancy   </div><div>527 words</div><div>9 August 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A15</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in the tri-state area are rising at a slower pace than the national average, the lingering effect of a foreclosure wave that is gripping the region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of single-family homes rose 12.2% nationwide in the second quarter compared with the year-earlier period, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. That was up from 11.3% in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the New York metropolitan area, which includes several New Jersey and New York suburban counties, median prices were up just 5% in the second quarter, slightly below the 5.1% growth in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said the New York region is lagging behind the nation in home-price appreciation in part due to foreclosure rates, which are falling rapidly in most of the country but remain a serious problem in New York and New Jersey. Foreclosed homes are often sold at steep discounts, which can work to drive down home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the second quarter, 8% of all mortgages in New Jersey and 6% of all mortgages in New York were in some stage of foreclosure, according to a report released Thursday by the Mortgage Bankers Association. While those rates are down modestly from the first quarter, New Jersey and New York have the second- and third-highest state foreclosure rates in the nation. Florida has the highest foreclosure rate of any state, at 10.58%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Both New York and New Jersey have very slow foreclosure processes," said Jeff Kolko, chief economist for the online real-estate company <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>. "A large backlog of homes could hold back prices in neighborhoods with more foreclosures."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kolko said based on <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> data, prices in much of New York and New Jersey were actually flat. The average gains for the region were driven mainly by a few hot markets. "There's an incredibly tight supply in Manhattan and Brooklyn, which has helped drive up prices."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices on Long Island, according to the Realtors data, grew by 5.5% in the second quarter. Price gains were even lower in Connecticut, where New Haven rose 2.2% and Hartford 3.5% during the period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though price rises in the region are running lower than the nation, some economists see reasons to be optimistic. David Stiff, chief economist at financial-services company <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> Case-Shiller, said the fact the prices are rising at all means "the markets are turning the corner." Many markets, he said, had falling prices last year but they "seemed to have bottomed out."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few upstate New York towns have been seeing unusually strong growth recently, including Kingston, a Hudson River town about 90 miles from Manhattan that has become trendy with some young people from New York City. Median home prices in Kingston rose 7.7% in the second quarter following a surprisingly robust 25.8% in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists believe outsize gains in small markets like Kingston could be driven by a small number of high-end home sales and may not mean that prices overall are appreciating.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anya Martin </div><div>785 words</div><div>9 August 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M10</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some condo developers and owners are playing favorites, asking potential buyers to use a "preferred" lender when buying a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The practice has both pluses and minuses. Using the seller's preferred lender often means speedier transactions. But before going that route, buyers should shop around to make sure they are getting the best interest rate and terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condo developers like preferred lenders because they help ensure the building's "warrantability." This means a condo's occupants, as a whole, meet minimum standards set by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and/or <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. For example, 50% of units must be owner-occupied, only 15% of residents can be more than 30 days late in association dues, no more than 20% of the square footage can be commercial space and there should not be any outstanding litigation involving the property. The preferred lender ideally has a comprehensive view of the building's makeup.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks generally follow the same guidelines as the government agencies when they issue jumbo mortgages, but they do have some flexibility when they work with a developer as the preferred lender, said Julian Hebron, vice president of San Francisco-based RPM Mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A preferred lender clause in a contract doesn't mean a buyer must use that lender. However, many condo sellers do stipulate that if the buyer hasn't been approved for financing within a specified period, such as 30 days, the buyer will agree to use the preferred lender, said Rolan Shnayder, director of new-development lending at New York City-based HOME Mortgage Bankers, which currently is a preferred lender for 125 condo projects, mostly in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The preferred lender is there for one purpose -- to get these deals closed," Mr. Shnayder said. He adds that by law, developers cannot accept money from a preferred lender in exchange for new customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some competitive residential markets, buyers with slow lenders or who submit offers that are contingent on financing can lose out on the condo they hoped to call home. "The market is so hot in New York that sellers pretty much across the board can reject financing contingencies," said Anne Corey, a real-estate agent with <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span> who specializes in luxury Manhattan homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of the challenges inherent in condo mortgage approval, a preferred lender can offer "speed and convenience" in closing a purchase, but borrowers should still shop around in case another lender can close a deal and save them money, said Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH.com, a website that tracks mortgage trends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It depends on how much you are putting down, your credit score and the type of loan. But all things being equal, if the preferred lender is a quarter point higher than the lender in the open marketplace, you have to weigh whether that convenience is worth the extra cost," Mr. Gumbinger said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if a buyer wants to use the preferred lender from the get-go, it's best to contact other lenders because the preferred lender may no longer be in business when the buyer becomes a seller down the road, Mr. Gumbinger said. "It matters more for resale purposes than you might think because the ability for the next buyer to get a loan is crucial, too," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few more considerations:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Be proactive. Potential buyers should use a real-estate agent who specializes in condos and will only show units in warrantable buildings, Ms. Corey, the Manhattan real-estate agent, said. That will make it easier to get financing down the road.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Be informed. Before advancing into the underwriting process, a borrower should inform potential lenders of any warrantability issue and ask directly if it is a deal-breaker, Mr. Shnayder said. Also ask for a loan officer who is knowledgeable on condo borrowing and the market conditions where the condo is located, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Don't get starry-eyed over incentives. Some developers offer rewards such as a cash rebate or even a kitchen upgrade to a buyer who uses their preferred lender. A borrower who has the option of a lower interest rate from another lender should do the math and compare costs over the life of the loan, Mr. Gumbinger said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, a wise buyer will consider the value of upgrades upon resale, he added. "Granite countertops may enhance the value of the home today, but you don't know what the fashion will be 10 years down the road," Mr. Gumbinger said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sanette Tanaka   </div><div>697 words</div><div>9 August 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Price Is Right" isn't just a game show. It is a mental strategy real-estate agents use to get the most money when listing a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When setting an asking price, there are two schools of thought: In one, agents overprice properties in the belief that a higher asking price will draw higher initial offers from potential buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wendy Jodel, associate broker with Town Residential in New York City, says overpricing works when inventory is low. Ms. Jodel recently listed a two-bedroom apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side for $1.35 million -- 4.5% above the price of similar apartments nearby. "I had no competition," she says, adding that few comparable apartments are available in the area. The apartment closed this week with multiple offers for $1.32 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other real-estate agents take the opposite approach, pricing homes below nearby properties in hopes of starting a bidding war. Chris McDonnell, senior associate broker with Coldwell Banker Distinctive Properties in Vail, Colo., says he prefers to underprice homes by 5% to 10%. Now, even in a heated market, buyers are looking for a bargain, he says. If sellers start low, they could potentially add 10% to 15% to the sale price. "There's so much pent-up demand out there right now. Money is just waiting on the sidelines," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This strategy, however, poses a challenge: "It's really hard to get your seller to agree to that," Mr. McDonnell says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New research tackles this dilemma. A study published in the Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization in May found that homeowners who set the initial asking price 10% to 20% higher than similar houses in the neighborhood see a slight increase of $117 to $163, on average, in their sale price. Pricing a home 20% or more than similar houses leads to an impact three to four times as big.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pricing a home 10% to 20% lower than homes in the neighborhood leads to a decrease of $117 to $187, on average, in the home's sale price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The research explores a behavioral trait called "anchoring." That is a common tendency to rely on the first piece of information offered (the "anchor") when making decisions. Once buyers have an anchor, they typically interpret other information involved in the sale around it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Every house is different, and so those qualitative things really matter. Buyers will turn to the good attributes that justify the high price," says Grace Bucchianeri, former assistant professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prof. Bucchianeri and co-author Julia Minson, a lecturer at the <span class="companylink">University of Pennsylvania</span> at the time, analyzed 14,616 real-estate transactions in Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania between January 2005 and April 2009 with an average sale price of $234,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study, "A homeowner's dilemma: Anchoring in residential real estate transactions" found that "overwhelmingly anchoring is a good strategy," Prof. Bucchianeri says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the same study, researchers found that while agents privately believe that overpricing leads to a higher final sale, they publicly advocate underpricing. In this study, 35 agents were shown 10 sample properties between March 28, 2011, and May 2, 2011, and asked to recommend a listing price. In 70.4% of the properties viewed, agents recommended underpricing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They had a "strong belief that listing low was the only way to go," Prof. Bucchianeri says. "'If you list it too high, you would never sell your house,' they thought."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pricing low may speed up the sale, which can save the real-estate agent both time and money spent marketing the property. In the end, agents may get a lower commission, but the difference is usually negligible. "It's intuitive if you think about it," she says. "It looks like the realtors are doing what's best for them, and as homeowners, we need to understand that relationship."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only a year and a half ago, none other than Warren Buffett told CNBC he would invest in "a couple hundred thousand" single-family homes if it were practical.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in that short period, the national housing market has gone from the cheapest it has been in a quarter-century to slightly overpriced—at least according to some measures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Relatively cheap mortgages still make it a great time to buy a home to live in, but anyone hoping to treat it as an "investment" should be wary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In early 2012, homes did indeed look inexpensive. To measure home values, some researchers divide home prices by rents. The resulting price/rent ratio is similar to the price/earnings ratio commonly used to evaluate stocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By that measure, in the fourth quarter of 2011—when the ratio was 19.9—homes were the cheapest they had been since 1987, according to data from Morris Davis, academic director of the James A. Graaskamp Center for Real Estate at the University of Wisconsin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, though, the housing narrative has done an about-face. Money managers have launched private-equity funds and real-estate investment trusts designed to scoop up homes and rent them out, and real-estate agents once again tell of bidding wars for homes in some areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just ask Dave Higgins, an agent at the Grubb Co. in Oakland, Calif. This year, a client was one of 20 bidders on a home that was listed for $950,000. His client won, but paid more than $1.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the magnitude of the price increase was extreme, he says, "I have a ton of stories like that out here."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, between May 2012 and May 2013, the latest month for which data are available, the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller 20-city index of home values climbed 12%. Home prices in two of the index's metro areas—Denver and Dallas, which missed much of the boom—hit all-time records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of signaling a bargain, the national price/rent ratio in June was at 22.8—already above the historic long-term average of 20.6.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That isn't to say home prices will start dropping again. Even more so than the stock market, the housing market is a slave to momentum. Prices get out of whack but continue to spiral upward as stories of double-digit gains spread from owner to owner. The last bubble, for example, took many years to inflate before popping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for value-seeking investors, the recent brief era of cheap prices is over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 1960, home prices have increased only by about 1.3% annually after inflation, according to Mr. Davis. He says that the current price/rent ratio suggests home prices will increase more slowly than rents over the next five to 10 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on different data, other researchers have found home prices over long periods merely keep up with inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other ways of valuing homes are slightly more optimistic but still don't call for a continuation of last year's boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of comparing prices to rents, some economists prefer to compare prices to average household income for a quick measure of homes' affordability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now, that ratio stands at about 1.78, according to <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics, compared with 1.92 between 1989 and 2003, before the housing boom started. To get back to average, home prices would have to rise another 8% if incomes stayed constant, says <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics economist Greg Bird.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the local level, some cities already look expensive. San Francisco at the end of the first quarter had a price/income ratio of 4.67, compared with the city's long-run average of 4.04, according to <span class="companylink">Moody's</span>, suggesting that it already is 13% overpriced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, in Las Vegas, where home prices tanked 62% during the bust, the ratio is merely 1.48 compared with its 1.87 average, suggesting prices have another 27% to climb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Moody's</span> uses its own numbers, but investors can find other personal-income data at www.bea.gov[http://www.bea.gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca] and home-price data from the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> (www.realtor.org[http://www.realtor.org]).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors probably will find most parts of the country aren't the screaming buys they were a year ago. But for those home buyers who want a place to live in, there still is a good argument for buying now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, by taking out a loan, buyers protect themselves on the outside chance that inflation skyrockets, Mr. Davis says. That is because high inflation would erode the true cost of the loan, which won't increase, even as home values and incomes rise, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second reason is mortgage rates. For the week ended Aug. 2, the average interest rate on a standard 30-year fixed-rate loan was 4.61%, according to the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is more than the sub-3.5% loans of a couple months ago, but much lower than the 6%-plus rates seen a few years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average national home price is about $240,000, according to the University of Wisconsin data. If a buyer took out a $192,000 mortgage on that home, he could expect to make monthly payments of about $985.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If mortgage rates rise one percentage point, the same buyer would need to see home prices fall 10% for the payment to be the same, according to mortgage-information website HSH.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A significant drop in prices is unlikely, says David Blitzer, managing director at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, who also tracks the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Mortgage rates, even though they've popped up a bit, are still close to as low as we've ever seen," he says. "If you've been thinking of buying a house, you better get out and do it."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hair stylist Sally Hershberger has put her 3,645-square-foot home in the Trousdale section of Beverly Hills on the market for $6.9 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three-bedroom, four-bathroom home sits on a promontory and has views of Los Angeles from downtown to the ocean, according to listing agent Jeff Kohl, a co-founder of real-estate firm the Agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Built in 1960, the house retained its original tactile block walls. It also has terrazzo floors that lead out to a curved swimming pool, which echoes the house's curved roofline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Hershberger, known for founding <span class="companylink">Sally Hershberger Professional Hair Care</span> and for creating Meg Ryan's shag haircut among other looks, bought the home in 2004 for $2.4 million, according to public records. She undertook a major renovation of the house in 2004 and 2005, Mr. Kohl says, hiring Carole Katleman to do the home's interiors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Hershberger lives in New York and the Hamptons. She has rented the house for the past five years, but the lease expires in October, Mr. Kohl says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carl Lewis, the retired track and field star who won nine gold Olympic medals, has put his 3-acre estate in Medford, N.J. on the market for $1.075 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 7,000-square-foot home has four bedrooms, four bathrooms, with vaulted ceilings and skylights. The property also has an indoor swimming pool and spa house. Originally built in 1988, the home was previously owned by professional hockey player and Olympian Dmitri Yushkevich. Mr. Lewis bought the two-story home in 2007 and extensively remodeled the kitchen, bathrooms, master suite, and swimming pool room, according to Diane Schram, Mr. Lewis's business manager. He also installed a system to provide solar power throughout the house among other improvements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sprinter and long jumper, whose full name is Frederick Carlton Lewis, was voted Sportsman of the Century by the <span class="companylink">International Olympic Committee</span> and was named Olympian of the Century by Sports Illustrated. According to Ms. Schram, Mr. Lewis, who is working on philanthropic efforts, is selling the home because he is relocating to Houston, where he used to live and where he attended college.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patricia Wright, an agent with Wright Choice Properties in Clementon, N.J., has the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dru Montagu, an heir to the Guinness British banking fortune, and his wife, Minnie, are selling their 9,000-square-foot home in the Casa de Campo resort in the Dominican Republic for $16.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Called "Casa Palapa," the house sits on its own 3-acre peninsula and has two private beaches. There is also a dock, paddle tennis court, organic gardens, an orchard and a heliport. There is also a three-bedroom guest cottage and separate servant's quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Wayne Hudson, who runs a public relations firm and is helping market the home, the house was built by noted Mexican architect Marco Aldaco, who had built a home in Acapulco for Mr. Montagu's uncle Loel Guinness, who was married to style icon Gloria Guinness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house is located in Casa de Campo, a resort with five golf courses and one of the largest marinas in the Caribbean as well as an equestrian center, a shooting center, shops, galleries, a movie theater and more than 20 restaurants as well as a small international airport.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Montagu is sportsman and philanthropist, and has a large estate in the British countryside. Mr. Hudson says Mr. Montagu has declined to comment on why he put his Dominican Republic home on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cesar Herrera of Provaltur, a <span class="companylink">Christie's International Real Estate</span> affiliate, has the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commodities investor and carbon trader Frank Fernandez-Asin and his wife, Katherine Jiwan Kim, have listed their 15,635-square-foot home on Virginia's "Gold Coast" for $15 million. Local real estate agents say it is one of the highest priced homes on the market in McLean, Va., which is a 10-minute drive from Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Built in 2011, the house has six bedrooms, 10 bathrooms and seven outdoor living areas. On the main floor, there is a two-story foyer with an oval skylight, a formal living room that opens through French doors onto a terrace, a mahogany-paneled library with white oak herringbone flooring and an eat-in kitchen with pearl wood quartzite counters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Upstairs, a master suite opens onto a terrace with sweeping views of the Potomac. On the lower level, there is a wet bar decorated with bullfighting memorabilia, a 15-seat home theater with stadium-style seating, a game room and a fitness center with glass walls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 30-foot-long underground tunnel is intended to connect the main home to a planned complex in the second, empty lot. The owners completed plans for a swimming pool, tennis court, indoor basketball court and guesthouse on that lot, but didn't build them. That lot can be sold separately.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fernandez-Asin and his wife paid $4.125 million for the waterfront property at the end of 2008, according to public records, combining two separate lots to create the current 3.22-acre parcel. On one of the lots, they commissioned Maryland architect Richard Foster to design a home, which is inspired by the Renaissance palaces of Northern Spain built during the 15th and 16th centuries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home's exterior is made from hand-chiseled limestone that was crafted by Portuguese masons flown in during construction. Wall sconces and candelabras were imported from Spain; there is Tuscan beige limestone in the main foyer and gallery halls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fernandez-Asin, once the largest carbon trader in the U.S., sold his business, AHL Carbono, to a power and gas company based in Italy in 2008. Now retired, he and his wife plan to move to Seattle, where she is from, with their children, according to listing agent Michael Anastasia, of TTR Sotheby's International Realty in McLean. </p>

</div><div class="author">By Mike Spector, Craig Karmin and Telis Demos </div><div>836 words</div><div>8 August 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Hilton Worldwide Inc</span>. is making preparations for a return to the public markets, choosing four banks to manage a share sale as the hotel group's private-equity owner looks to capitalize on a rebounding real-estate market and strong investor demand for initial public offerings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hilton, taken private by <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span> in 2007 for more than $18 billion and $7 billion in assumed debt in the hotel industry's largest-ever private-equity buyout, tapped <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank AG</span>, <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>.'s Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch and <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> as the main underwriters for the widely expected IPO, said people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hotel chain could tap additional banks before filing IPO papers with regulators later this year, some of the people said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private-equity firms have been aggressively shedding stakes in companies, as a record-breaking run by U.S. stock indexes spurred investors' appetite for stock sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through Wednesday's market close, 121 IPOs had priced in the U.S. this year, the highest number of deals by this point in the year since 2007, according to data provider Dealogic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month was the busiest July of any year since 2003 in terms of the number of U.S. equity issuances, which also include so-called follow-on stock sales after IPOs. U.S.-listed IPOs have raised $28.6 billion through Wednesday's market close, and follow-ons in the U.S. have raised $119.6 billion, according to Dealogic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An IPO would cap a big comeback for Hilton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chain struggled under heavy debts taken on in <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>'s buyout. Hilton, like others, had difficulties attracting customers in the wake of the financial crisis and recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At one point, <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> recorded a paper loss of two-thirds of its roughly $6 billion equity investment in the hotel chain, said a person familiar with the firm's accounting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> worked to restructure Hilton's debt load, and the hotel chain now is performing better as the commercial property market rebounds, with both hotel occupancy and room rates improving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of the IPO preparations, the tapped banks are expected to aid Hilton with refinancing roughly $13 billion in debt, one of the people said. Bloomberg earlier reported on the restructuring plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During its second-quarter earnings call last month, Blackstone Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman said that Hilton's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization rose 17% in the first half.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the call, Mr. Schwarzman called Hilton <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>'s largest current investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is unclear what kind of valuation <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> would seek or how much of its stake it would sell. Chris Snow, an analyst at CreditSights Inc., said that while Hilton doesn't disclose financial results, he estimated an IPO could potentially be a "multibillion-dollar" transaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hilton could launch an IPO sometime during the first few months of next year, one of the people said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hilton explored a sale earlier this summer but couldn't agree on terms with any potential suitors, some of the people said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private-equity firms typically aim to sell companies they own to realize a return in one fell swoop before taking them public, since stock-price fluctuations and rules related to IPOs can make it take longer for them to sell their investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Hilton public offering would be by far the biggest deal among a spate of expected sales for <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>, especially in commercial real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyout firm is looking to sell or take public its La Quinta hotel chain and in July filed plans with regulators to take lodging company <span class="companylink">Extended Stay America Inc</span>. public after buying it out of bankruptcy proceedings with two partners in 2010. <span class="companylink">Brixmor Property Group</span>, a retail property company <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> owns, also has filed plans to go public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hilton at one point looked like one of the private-equity industry's big mistakes made during the buyout boom preceding the financial crisis. But <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> made some moves to salvage it, including revamping the hotel chain's balance sheet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> in 2010 reached a deal with Hilton's creditors to reduce the company's roughly $20 billion in debt by nearly $4 billion and extend the due date on roughly all existing financial obligations to 2015. The deal involved debt buybacks and converting some debt to ownership stakes in Hilton.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Craig Karmin and Robbie Whelan </div><div>902 words</div><div>7 August 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span>, one of the biggest real-estate owners in the U.S., is preparing to sell billions of dollars of property, the latest sign that commercial property values are back to levels not seen since the economic downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The private-equity firm has hired <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co</span>. and <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> to explore both a private sale and a possible public offering of its La Quinta hotel chain, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> values the limited-service hotel operator at around $4.5 billion, including debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move to sell La Quinta, which operates about 800 moderately priced lodgings with few amenities like restaurants or conference rooms, comes as investor interest in hotels is picking up with more business travel and tourism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> last month also filed plans to sell shares in its <span class="companylink">Extended Stay America</span> hotel operator, which has an equity value between $3 billion and $4 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, the firm and its partners also filed plans to sell shares to the public in <span class="companylink">Brixmor Property Group</span>, a retail company that owns 522 shopping centers and has been valued around $13 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those deals would be a precursor to a widely expected initial public offering for <span class="companylink">Hilton Worldwide</span>, which industry analysts say could file IPO plans before year-end. <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> acquired the company for more than $18 billion, plus more than $7 billion in assumed debt, in 2007. All told, these companies coming up for sale have a value of about $50 billion, including debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only a portion of that amount would likely be sold publicly in the near term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> has told analysts recently that it expects selling activity to accelerate during the next couple of years and is part of its business plan of buying companies, improving them and then selling them within a five to seven year period. The New York private-equity firm continues to invest from its record $13.3 billion global property fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some investors view the pickup in selling by one of the savviest real-estate investors as a bet that the commercial-property market could be approaching a peak, before historically low interest rates rise and the debt markets turn volatile again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"To see so much supply coming from an expert owner makes me concerned about whether pricing is at the right level, or if this is a sign that it could be a little frothy" said Joel Beam, who invests in hotel real-estate investment trusts for the Forward Select Income Fund, a mutual fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial real-estate values in the U.S. have been steadily rising over the past four years and are near peak levels, aided by low interest rates and higher yields than fixed income. The Green Street Commercial Property Index, which tracks the value of real-estate owned by REITs, has risen 68% from its trough in mid-2009, as the improving economy has boosted occupancies, rents and nightly hotel rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> has been one of the most voracious buyers of property over the past several years and has timed some of its sales at the top of the market, leaving buyers with regret. After purchasing Sam Zell's <span class="companylink">Equity Office Properties Trust</span> for $39 billion in 2007, <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> unloaded much of that portfolio to buyers including a <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> fund and New York developer Harry Macklowe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not every deal has been timed well, though. <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> acquired Hilton for more than $18 billion, plus more than $7 billion in assumed debt, in 2007. Thanks in part to a debt restructuring in 2010, that deal is now in profitable, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> is the largest owner of hotel rooms in the U.S. with nearly 200,000 rooms. The risk for the firm, some analysts say, is that it is selling these hotel companies over a short period, raising the prospect that hotel buyers could get filled up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some analysts say that lodging should perform well in the current economic environment. They point out that, if interest rates rise, hotels can raise daily rates more easily than at office buildings or other properties with long leases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're actually in the sweet spot of the cycle, and it will probably be that way for a few years," said David Loeb, a hotel analyst with <span class="companylink">Robert W. Baird &amp; Co</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> acquired La Quinta for $2.3 billion plus debt in 2006. The private-equity firm invested hundreds of millions of dollars to upgrade, expand and promote the chain, which included hiring actor Fred Willard to do voice-over in television commercials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>'s ownership, La Quinta has nearly doubled the number of hotels in the chain to 805 and now has more than 80,000 rooms. While the hotel properties themselves account for about two-thirds of the value of La Quinta, the company stopped buying new properties and focused on growing through franchises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The private-equity firm and its two partners bought Extended Stay out of bankruptcy in 2010 for $3.9 billion. The new owners spent about $400 million on the company.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto </div><div>950 words</div><div>7 August 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A15</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the real-estate battle between Manhattan's East and West sides, the East Side had long counted among its advantages a patchwork of small green oases. But recently, a taste for industrial buildings and the wild popularity of new parks such as the High Line have turned the momentum west.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, a new report highlights the open-space problems facing the East Side, where two-thirds of residents don't live within walking distance of a large park and the existing spaces are overburdened and disconnected. The report, commissioned by City Council members Daniel Garodnick and Jessica Lappin, comes as East Side boosters and the city make the most concerted effort in decades to create more open space, including by transforming the area's waterfront into a continuous string.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The reality is that [the East Side] is one of the most underserved communities in the city in terms of the actual amount of open space," said Holly Leicht, executive director of New Yorkers for Parks, a nonprofit group that wrote the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The see-saw from East Side to West is mostly an accident of history and geography: The East Side is largely built up and doesn't have the benefit of large, undeveloped industrial relics like the High Line or piers that jut into the Hudson River. The East Side waterfront is narrow, wedged between the FDR Drive and a river with a swift-flowing current.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result is a smattering of small playgrounds and parks, and, of course, Central Park, which while a clear boon to the area's open space, is out of walking distance for many residents further south or out on First Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Ms. Lappin's district -- which includes much of the Upper East Side east of Third Avenue -- 13% of residents live within walking distance of a large park. The district has less than half an acre of open space per 1,000 residents, compared to 2.5 acres that the city uses as a guideline in its environmental review process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Mr. Garodnick's district -- a patchwork that includes Stuyvesant Town on the eastern end of 14th Street, the Grand Central Terminal office district, and the Upper East Side near Central Park -- 40% of residents don't live within walking distance of a large public park. There are no community gardens and less than a quarter-acre of open space per 1,000 residents compared to the standard of 2.5 acres.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We knew that the East Side of Manhattan was starved for parks space. What we did not know was that we would fail on every subcategory that was measured," Mr. Garodnick said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For New Yorkers like Josh Rieders, a 28-year-old who works in finance, easier access to outdoor activities on the West Side is a big draw. He is moving to an apartment in the West 30s from a place near Stuyvesant Town. "I have free access to Hudson River Park, playing tennis and going to Chelsea Piers to play hockey," he said. "I think the East Side thinks it's cooler, but it's really the West Side."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His broker, Lorett Vigon of Citi Habitats, said the High Line had drawn other clients from the East Side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The parks on the East Side tend to be small but well used. Liz McKell, who has a 4-year-old daughter, said St. Catherine's Park, at First Avenue and East 67th Street, gets overcrowded after school lets out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's crazy to the point where kids will be knocked off their feet," she said. "I would always leave around 2:30-ish because it got too busy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">East Side politicians have seized on a number of recent opportunities to demand more open space as part of public approval of new development projects, including the expansions of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and the United Nations, and the construction of large new residential projects by developers Michael Stern and Sheldon Solow. Most recently, community groups are pushing for improvements to public space as part of the Bloomberg administration's proposed rezoning of Midtown East.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By far the most ambitious open-space project would create a rival to the West Side's popular Hudson River Park by creating a continuous running and biking path along the East River.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The waterfront stretch from the Brooklyn Bridge to East 38th Street is already largely accessible, although efforts are under way to make it a bigger draw, including the announcement last week of a beach under the Brooklyn Bridge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While much of the waterfront uptown is accessible much of it is very poorly maintained, according to the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One particularly challenging strip is from East 38th Street to East 60th Street, where the only way to have continuous open space is to build over the water, said Brian Kavanagh, a state assembly member whose district encompasses much of that area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state in 2011 allowed the city to transfer a portion of Robert Moses Playground to the U.N. for a new office tower in exchange for $70 million to fund the waterfront transformation. The deal with the U.N. hasn't been finalized, but the city has moved forward with some aspects of the plan, including designing the esplanade and the creation of a new park on Asser Levy Place between 23rd and 25th streets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea had been in the works for years, but there was "a lot of skepticism" from the community that giving up the playground would result in new park space, Mr. Kavanagh said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Eliot Brown and Erica Orden </div><div>887 words</div><div>7 August 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A15</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A New York state commission to investigate corruption has issued subpoenas to three high-profile New York City real-estate developers, seeking information related to valuable tax breaks they received in state legislation, according to people informed of the subpoenas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The subpoenas were sent in recent days to <span class="companylink">Extell Development Co</span>., <span class="companylink">Silverstein Properties Inc</span>. and Thor Equities, the people said, and seek information related to a housing bill that passed the Legislature and was signed by Gov. Andrew Cuomo in late January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bill included a provision that would allow for greatly reduced residential property taxes for years on five specific Manhattan development sites, including Extell's 1,004-foot hotel condo tower called One57 by Central Park, Silverstein's planned Four Seasons tower in Lower Manhattan, and a Thor Equities site on Fifth Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One person who examined a subpoena from the commission, known as the Moreland Commission to Investigate Public Corruption, said the information requested was extensive, seeking emails and other communications with lobbyists and elected officials over multiple years relating to the tax break.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kathleen Rice, Nassau County District Attorney and co-chairwoman of the commission, said the commission has begun issuing subpoenas, but she declined to say who received them or the topicof the inquiries. "We have not prejudged anyone or anything -- we are going to follow whatever evidence we have, wherever it goes," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for Extell said the company "will cooperate fully with any agency trying to improve government."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The subpoenas could eventually help shed light on advocacy and lobbying by the real-estate and development sector, long a powerful force in Albany politics. Top landlords and their advocacy groups traditionally are prolific donors, contributing millions of dollars each election cycle collectively to the campaign committees of governors and influential members of the Legislature, and the outcomes of policies like taxes and rent regulation can cost -- or make -- them fortunes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Moreland Commission was convened by executive order in July after lawmakers didn't enact anticorruption measures sought by Gov. Andrew Cuomo amid a stretch of high-profile arrests of state legislators. The 25-person commission has the power to subpoena records, question witnesses under oath and, if necessary, refer cases for prosecution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an executive order, Mr. Cuomo directed the commission to examine the areas of state government most likely to intersect with lawmakers: the state Board of Elections, lobbying laws and practices, campaign-finance matters, including disclosure of third-party contributions, and expenditures and bribery laws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The legislation at issue was lobbied for by the Real Estate Board of New York, the industry's main advocacy arm, according to multiple executives who have discussed the matter with Real Estate Board officials. The group lobbied both the Legislature and Cuomo administration officials for the bill, the executives said, arguing that the owners had been under the impression that their sites qualified for the tax break, which is known as 421-A. At least two of those developers -- Silverstein and Extell -- had collectively contributed millions of dollars to build dozens of units of low-income housing in the city, as was required by 421-A regulations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 421-A incentive is a decades-old tax break meant to spur apartment development, initially passed when building was less lucrative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the developers' impressions, prior 421-A legislation didn't include their properties because they were located in high-density zones, which don't qualify for the tax break. The January legislation was mostly focused on a separate real-estate issue but included language allowing 421-A tax breaks for five specific Manhattan sites. The overall bill received wide support in the Legislature as well as from city officials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Real Estate Board characterized the bill at the time as correcting an oversight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The legislation has since come under criticism from housing advocates and some legislators in part because it singled out specific development sites, rather than making a broad-based policy change for high-density sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If that's the argument they're making -- that it was an error in the language . . . any similar development anywhere in the city should have been included," said Brian Paul, a research and policy coordinator at <span class="companylink">Common Cause</span>, a nonprofit group focused on government. Mr. Paul added that incentives for economic development are generally meant to spur development that otherwise wouldn't have occurred. One57 was already under construction when it was extended the tax break.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The legislation attracted further criticism because multiple developers are aiming to sell condos at their buildings to the super-wealthy, which contrasts with the most recent changes to 421-A that aimed to help increase production of low-income housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The properties include Extell's One57 -- which has been finding buyers for some of the most high-priced homes in the city, such as two apartments with selling prices of more than $90 million -- the site of a planned 926-foot Four Seasons condo hotel by <span class="companylink">Silverstein Properties</span>, and a site on Fifth Avenue owned by Thor Equities. It couldn't be learned if the owners of the developers connected with the two other sites named in the legislation had received subpoenas.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Maura Webber Sadovi </div><div>774 words</div><div>7 August 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">North Korean leader Kim Jong Un may unwittingly be playing a bit part in some of this year's bigger real-estate deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take the recent sale of Washington Harbour, a mixed-use Washington complex on the banks of the Potomac River in the capital's elegant Georgetown neighborhood. The property was acquired last month for $373 million by a group of South Korean investors via a unit of <span class="companylink">Principal Financial Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seller was a venture of <span class="companylink">Rockpoint Group</span>, a private Boston real-estate-investment firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal came together in the spring as rising tensions between North and South Korea flared. In March, North Korea's saber rattling escalated as it declared invalid the Korean War Armistice. The U.S. and South Korea have had strained relations for decades with North Korea and some played down the moves by Kim Jong Un as a calculated attempt to prove himself as a new leader.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the situation may have spooked investors in South Korea, who are moving billions of dollars into real estate outside of the region. Traditionally, turmoil in Asia, the Middle East and elsewhere prompts investors to buy properties and businesses in the U.S., Canada and Europe, which are typically perceived to be more stable and safe from major political unrest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate-services firm <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> says that world-wide, South Koreans have spent $5.4 billion on real estate outside their home market in the first half of this year, already more than double the $2 billion spent the previous year. This is a record since JLL began keeping records in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far this year, South Korea has become the biggest foreign investor in real estate world-wide, followed by Canada and Singapore respectively, according to JLL. Year to date, South Koreans are the fourth-biggest real-estate investors in the U.S., according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, a New York real-estate-research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a mix of reasons, but with the whole blowup between North and South Korea . . . they started to put their money down," said Steve Collins, international director with JLL.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate professionals say South Koreans first began buying glitzy offshore properties several years ago after restrictions on South Korean pension funds investing abroad eased. But the buying has accelerated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This spring saw a string of U.S. property purchases by South Koreans, accounting for 39% of South Korea's capital outflow into global real estate, according to JLL.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, <span class="companylink">Mirae Asset Global Investments Co</span>., a South Korean financial-services firm, paid $218 million for an office tower in Chicago, and JLL said South Korean investors were part of a group that agreed to acquire a Houston office tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">South Korean investors first gained notice when they bought a number of high-profile properties in Europe and Australia immediately after the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2009, the <span class="companylink">National Pension Service</span> of South Korea, one of the world's largest pension funds, paid more than $1 billion for <span class="companylink">HSBC Holdings PLC</span>'s office tower in London and bought the Sony Center in Berlin in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Washington Harbour deal reflects a South Korean taste for upscale properties with strong cash flows. The 1980s-era property has been compared to a sand castle because of its curvy design that overlooks the river. It has an outdoor skating rink. It was designed by Arthur Cotton Moore, who is known for his renovation of part of the <span class="companylink">Library of Congress</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its 558,000-square-feet of office and retail space are 96% occupied through long-term leases to such tenants as law firm <span class="companylink">Foley &amp; Lardner LLP</span> and restaurants like Tony &amp; Joe's Seafood Place. It is expected to yield a return of about 5.5%. <span class="companylink">HFF Inc</span>. marketed the property for the seller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts are watching to see if the South Koreans can sustain this pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Troy Stangarone, senior director at the Korea Economic Institute of America, a Washington think tank, expects South Korean investors to remain a force in the global property market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He sees a push to invest abroad as part of a longer-term structural shift for South Koreans now ramping up as world economies stabilize following the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But others say rising interest rates and an easing of tensions at home could reduce the South Korean appetite for foreign real estate. "If tensions ease in northeast Asia, obviously the risk premium goes down," said Dan Fasulo, a managing director at Real Capital.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Christopher Bjork and Richard Boudreaux </div><div>912 words</div><div>7 August 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MADRID -- Spanish officials managing soured assets from the country's real-estate collapse announced their first big property deal, choosing Miami-based private-equity firm <span class="companylink">H.I.G. Capital</span> to buy a majority stake in a package of 939 homes known as Project Bull.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials said the property deal, one of the most closely watched in Europe this year, priced the portfolio at 100 million euros ($133 million).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The properties were transferred to a Bank Asset Fund, which provides a favorable tax regime to investors, officials said. H.I.G.'s <span class="companylink">Bayside Capital</span> agreed to take a 51% stake in the fund. Spain's "bad bank," the government-run asset-management firm known as Sareb, will retain a 49% stake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">H.I.G. Capital</span> beat rival bids from <span class="companylink">Lone Star Funds</span>, <span class="companylink">Apollo Global Management LLC</span>, <span class="companylink">Colony Capital LLC</span> and a joint offer by <span class="companylink">Centerbridge Capital Partners LP</span> and <span class="companylink">Cerberus Capital Management LP</span>, people familiar with the transaction said. Sareb didn't name the other bidders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property experts called the agreement a benchmark deal for Spain because it will set precedents on price levels for transactions carried out by Sareb, which was set up by the government as part of last year's 41.3 billion euro <span class="companylink">European Union</span> bailout of the country's banks. Sareb took on foreclosed property and bad loans to real-estate developers from the weakest Spanish banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The properties in the Project Bull portfolio, which include homes in Madrid, Andalusia, Catalonia, the Canary Islands and other parts of Spain, had belonged to <span class="companylink">Bankia SA</span>, the largest of the bailed-out lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spanish officials said Tuesday's deal indicates that new investment is returning to the crisis-struck Spanish property sector for the first time in years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The quality of the bids submitted shows the confidence that investors have in Sareb and in the recovery of Spain's real-estate market," said Belen Romana, president of Sareb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Juan Barba, Sareb's director of real-estate assets, said the deal "allows us to be optimistic with regards to the portfolios we plan to put on to the wholesale market over the second half of the year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the next 15 years, Sareb aims to sell real-estate debt and properties acquired this year from nationalized lenders at deep discounts, for 50.8 billion euros. The properties, numbering 106,856, include partially built beachfront resorts, empty and occupied apartments, plots of scrubland, and at least one church. Sareb aims for an average rate of return of 13% to 14% a year on its operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday's deal comes as the property sector in Spain is showing tentative signs of life. Even though official estimates still show decreases in house prices, real-estate company Fotocasa said last week that its own property index showed a 0.7% uptick in the price of used homes between July and June, the first since January 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, the <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span> agreed to buy 1,890 rent-controlled apartments in Madrid from the city's government, for a total of 128 million euros. And France's Axa Real Estate recently purchased 13 office buildings off the Catalonian government, for 172 million euros.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> is also among several international bidders looking at another similar portfolio being sold by the regional government of Madrid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alfonso Benavides, global head of real estate for U.K.-based law firm <span class="companylink">Clifford Chance</span>, said that economic uncertainties in Spain and worries about a potential breakup of the euro zone kept foreign investors out of Spain last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when fears about the euro zone receded, funds returned. "Since February, it has been very busy. Assuming our competitors are doing more or less what we're doing, the market in Spain is very hot," Mr. Benavides said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, the investors putting money into Spain now aren't betting on a strong recovery of the economy, which has been in and out of recession for the past five years, nor on a quick turnaround in real-estate prices, which are expected to decline further in the medium term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Spain's housing bubble burst in 2008, home prices have tumbled more than 30%, swaths of building firms have gone out of business and housing sales have nearly ground to a halt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">H.I.G. and <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> are buying at steep discounts. And in <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>'s case, the purchased assets may benefit from being managed more efficiently than by the former owner. Despite having a waiting list to occupy many of the apartments, only 65% of them are currently occupied, said a person close to <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Benavides said foreign firms are testing the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They try to do a medium to small transaction first, learn the whole process, learn the local rules, and once they feel relatively comfortable start to make bigger transactions," he said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHANGHAI—Two small Chinese property developers said Wednesday they hope to raise a combined 3.3 billion yuan ($539 million) through bond and stock sales, boosting hopes that regulators will open the taps to fresh capital for cash-squeezed real-estate firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regulators have been limiting fundraising by Chinese property developers since 2010, when authorities stopped approving applications for initial public stock offerings and refinancing moves as part of a government effort to cool property speculation and prevent housing prices from rising too quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new applications to raise capital still need to be approved by regulators, and it isn't clear whether they will be. Chinese securities officials couldn't be reached for comment Wednesday. Still, shares of the applicants gained, suggesting many see a potential policy shift.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Though regulatory approval [for the fundraising plans] has yet to be granted…the market will likely think that real-estate financing policy may be about to change," said Chen Li, chief China strategist at UBS Securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hangzhou-based <span class="companylink">Sundy Land Investment Co</span>. said Wednesday it is seeking permission from the <span class="companylink">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span> for a private share placement of 1.5 billion yuan to fund residential housing projects in eastern China's Nanjing and Hangzhou, while Fuzhou-based <span class="companylink">Citychamp Dartong Corp</span>. said it plans to issue up to 1.8 billion yuan of convertible bonds to fund a commercial-property project in Nanjing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The announcements followed the Friday statement by Zhejiang-based Xinhu Zhongbao Co. that it wants to raise 5.5 billion yuan in a private share sale to fund the redevelopment of aging low-cost housing in Shanghai.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">News of the latest fundraising plans, which also need shareholder approval, sent Sundy's stock surging 7.6% in Shanghai, while shares of Citychamp gained 0.5%. The Shanghai Composite Index shed 0.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hopes for an easing of the restrictive policies have sent Chinese property stocks up 5% since early July, when market talk surfaced of a backdoor stock listing by another developer. The Shanghai Composite is up 3.4% over the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China has maintained a slew of curbs on its property sector—including limits on home purchases and on credit to homebuyers, and higher downpayment requirements—as part of its price-cooling effort. In addition to restrictions on stock and bond offerings, regulators have also limited bank lending, though banks can still extend loans to clients considered stronger and can lend toward affordable-housing projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the economy is slowing, and because the real-estate sector is such a crucial contributor to growth, many investors are convinced that policy makers will ultimately ease some of these restrictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moves to shore up the financial position of developers could keep growth from slipping too much because investment from developers underpins sales of everything from steel to cement to land, buoying demand across the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Communist Party's powerful Politburo late last month called for steady economic growth in the second half of the year, saying it wanted to promote "stable and healthy" development of the property market. It also made no mention of the need for further market-tightening measures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span> has said it would act according to directives of the State Council, or cabinet, which allow it to be more accommodative to plans to fund low-cost social housing projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts warned against taking the recent announcements as a sign that refinancings for domestic property development are on the verge of a big comeback.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The question remains how fast the CSRC will approve these proposals, and which proposals will get the go-ahead," said CIMB analyst Johnson Hu.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors are expecting that more companies will tap the capital market for funds, noting that Sundy's proposal was to finance private housing projects as well as low-cost social housing projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Amid the current macroeconomic development and property tightening policy environment, housing demand that stems from urbanization of new areas will become the main type of housing demand," said Sundy in its stock-exchange announcement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company noted that most of the units in these proposed projects are for apartments smaller than 90 square meters, which target first-time homebuyers. This is in line with the State Council's guidance to developers and banks to support first-time homebuyers.</p>

</div><div class="author">Esther Fung </div><div>539 words</div><div>6 August 2013</div><div>09:13</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHANGHAI—Strong profit growth at China's largest property developer by sales signals that demand in the crucial real-estate sector remains resilient, providing a prop to a slowing Chinese economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shenzhen-based <span class="companylink">China Vanke Co</span>., which has a presence in more than 60 Chinese cities, on Tuesday said net profit rose 22% in the first half compared with a year earlier, to 4.56 billion yuan ($745 million). Vanke, which is one of the first Chinese developers to report this season, is often seen as a bellwether for the property sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the real-estate sector the main contributor to China's domestic demand, strong sales and rising profits are positives for growth. Increased investment by developers underpins the sales of everything from steel to land, buoying demand across the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vanke said property developers in general have been increasingly active. "Domestic property developers have boosted their investments in first- and second-tier cities where housing transactions are strong, which led to intense competition and ever-rising prices in the land markets," said Vanke President Yu Liang in a statement. First-tier cities are wealthy metropolises such as Beijing and Shanghai, while second-tier cities occupy a level below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The larger, listed property developers are expected to announce solid first-half earnings after benefiting from strong housing sales earlier this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For more than three years, beginning in early 2010, China curbed multiple-home purchases, squeezed credit to developers and increased down payments for buyers in a campaign to rein in rising property prices and prevent social instability stemming from resentment over unaffordable homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, housing sales have remained strong despite the property curbs, as more consumers expect Beijing to refrain from imposing further property curbs amid a slowing economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vanke, which caters to mass-market home buyers and builds mainly small- to medium-size homes, said the average price of a housing transaction was 9,842 yuan per square meter in the first half, 8.8% lower than during the same period a year earlier, because it sold more homes in cities where prices were lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, contract sales of Chinese property developers grew 46% year-over-year in the first half, supported by solid underlying demand for homes, ratings firm Moody's Investors Service said last week. But it said the growth rate was lower than the 69% recorded in the first quarter, reflecting that pent-up demand had already been gradually absorbed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices have also edged up. China's housing-price growth accelerated in July, especially in larger cities, as liquidity conditions improved after a short-lived credit crunch in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices of homes included in a survey of 100 Chinese cities were up 7.9% from a year earlier, according to data provider <span class="companylink">China Real Estate</span> Index System. Month-on-month price increases quickened to 0.87% from June's 0.77% gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The return to rapid rises in house prices reflects strong demand in the sector, but it risks a sharper correction down the line, as house prices realign with incomes.</p>

</div><div class="author">Ainsley Thomson </div><div>735 words</div><div>6 August 2013</div><div>06:13</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON—Rising factory output, house prices and retail sales provided further signs the U.K. economy is experiencing a significant recovery, as the <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span> considers whether it will offer guidance on its monetary policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Office for National Statistics</span> on Tuesday said industrial production—which includes manufacturing, mining and quarrying, energy supply and waste management—increased 1.1% in June compared with May, almost twice the pace forecast by economists. The robust monthly figure lifted the sector to its strongest quarterly performance since December 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturing alone rose 1.9% in June, with an ONS official saying it was the first time all 13 manufacturing subsectors had risen in the same month since June 1992.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest official figures follow a string of strong surveys, indicating the economic recovery continues to gather momentum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Institute of Economic and Social Research on Tuesday released its latest forecast that showed the economy grew 0.7% in the three months to the end of July, up from 0.6% in the three months to the end of June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier Tuesday, the <span class="companylink">British Retail Consortium</span> said retail sales rose, delivering the strongest July performance in seven years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High-street lender Halifax reported demand for homes increased as house prices rose at the fastest annual pace in three years, while the average house price hit an almost five-year high in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the <span class="companylink">Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders</span> said the number of new car registrations rose 12.7% in July from June to 162,228—the 17th straight monthly rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, a survey suggested the U.K.'s services sector expanded at the strongest pace for 6½ years in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said it was notable that the improved data was coming from a wide range of sectors, indicating the recovery was broad based.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For now, then, it looks as if the economy is benefiting from a period of both stronger and better-balanced growth," said Samuel Tombs, U.K. economist at Capital Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strong run of data underlines the challenge facing the BOE. Under normal circumstances, figures like those released Monday and Tuesday would fuel expectations that the central bank would soon raise its benchmark interest rate to stop the economy from growing too quickly, and generating a surge in inflation, which it is mandated to control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the recent pickup in activity follows a number of years of near-stagnation in the wake of the deep recession that followed the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy is still smaller than it was five years ago, and despite its June surge, industrial output remains 13% below its 2008 peak. The BOE is expected to signal Wednesday in new forecasts that it believes the economy has plenty of room in which to expand before inflationary pressures start to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BOE Gov. Mark Carney and officials from the central bank's Monetary Policy Committee will also present the findings of a review into the merits of "forward guidance," a central bank tool that is already being deployed in various forms by the U.S. Federal Reserve, the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> and the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span>, which Mr. Carney led before taking the helm at the BOE on July 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By pledging to keep interest rates low, either for an extended period or until certain economic thresholds are crossed, central banks believe they can drive faster growth by prodding households and businesses to spend more or make new investments, safe in the knowledge that their borrowing costs are unlikely to ratchet up anytime soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Knightley, an economist at ING in London, said the strong run of data highlights the importance of Wednesday's announcement, as the central bank tries to prevent market interest rates and sterling from rising too high too quickly and choking off the recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite Tuesday's stronger-than-expected industrial-production figures, Melanie Bowler, an economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics, said there are still significant headwinds for the sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The outlook remains relatively constrained given that domestic demand remains bound by fiscal austerity and that still-severe economic difficulties facing key euroland trade partners suggest demand for British exports will remain contained," she said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Carmel Melouney </div><div>894 words</div><div>5 August 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A18</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some South Street Seaport businesses that were displaced by superstorm Sandy are finally returning to their properties eight months later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area of Front Street between Peck Slip and Beekman Street was hit hard during Sandy, with 8 feet of ocean water flooding the cobblestone streets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The block is home to the Historic Front Street development, a joint venture of the <span class="companylink">Durst Organization</span> and Zuberry Development Corp. that has 94 residential apartments and 13 retail spaces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 11 restored 18th-century buildings and three modern buildings have now been completely renovated, with keys handed back to residents and retailers on July 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We had a really hard time not telling people when we were going to be finished because we really didn't know, it was always changing," said Zuberry partner Dick Berry, who has had partnerships with the Dursts on various projects since 1982.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has been an extended effort to restore the Front Street buildings after the August storm. A study by the Downtown Alliance, a neighborhood service and advocacy group, found that downtown Manhattan had largely recovered by four months after Sandy, with 90% of retailers south of Chambers Street back in business at that point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Durst said the renovations cost just shy of $18 million, with insurance covering about half of the outlays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to replacing the flooded floors and walls, the buildings were re-engineered with new elevators and electrical and security systems. Geothermal heating and cooling systems that were previously in the basement moved up to the roof.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residents in 32 apartments have now returned to their old neighborhood, while Durst has signed leases with 14 new tenants since July 1, leaving 48 apartments vacant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the retail portion of the development, 11 of the 12 original tenants -- all small, independent businesses -- re-signed leases after deciding to resurrect their operations in their former premises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two retail spaces remain vacant: 224 Front St., which was already unoccupied before Sandy, and 216 Front, which was previously a furniture and bathroom fixture showroom. Asking rents are $100 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retailers returning to their stores were given $20 a square foot by Durst to rebuild their space. They also were offered business loans to be repaid over the course of their leases, although not all tenants took them. Durst said the tenants were put on the same schedule for rent increases as before the storm and all were offered a right to terminate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Becker, Durst's senior leasing manager, said it took a while for the commercial tenants to decide whether to re-open their stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think [tenants] were shocked about what happened," he said. "They had to assess whether they could they come back into business, and would they want to?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amanda Byron, owner of the Salty Paw pet store and dog-grooming spa at 38 Peck Slip, said she was lucky enough to rent a temporary space nearby since April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Byron has re-signed her lease for seven years, but says she had trouble finding a contractor to rebuild her store because Durst requires such workers to have $5 million in insurance coverage, higher than what many small-time handymen carry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The bottom line is there will be no handymen in my shop, and I'm a small 850-square-foot shop," said Ms. Byron.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Durst spokesman, Jordan Barowitz, said the insurance coverage was necessary because "they are very old buildings that we just invested a lot of money in and we want to make sure if something happens there is enough insurance to cover any damage."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stefano Barbagallo, whose Italian restaurant at 225/227 Front was called Barbarini Alimentari but will reopen as Barbalu, said he considered leaving the neighborhood altogether after seven years in the space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I thought about it for a while but I have an emotional attachment to the space," said Mr. Barbagallo. "I decided to take a risk. It's a beautiful space, historical with a lot of character. I'm not interested in a more modern building in the Financial District."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Barbagallo has re-signed his lease for 10 years, and plans to open in early September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jack Mazzola, who owns Jack's Stir Brew Coffee at 222 Front, said he hopes to reopen at the end of September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I couldn't be more excited to reopen. It took five years to establish ourselves as the local neighborhood coffee shop," Mr. Mazzola said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mazzola said he received financial assistance from the Downtown Alliance, "enough to buy an espresso machine," and accepted about $25,000 credit from Durst to be repaid over the course of his 10-year lease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I questioned [moving away] for a minute or two, but seeing it slowly coming back to life, I'm sure it will return bigger and stronger," Mr. Mazzola said of Front Street. "I'm a nut for old New York."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Berry said he is pleased so many of the existing tenants are returning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We chose them years ago when we opened the place because they had a New York flavor," he said. "They weren't chains, and they reflected what we tried to do when we renovated the whole block to create a very New York space."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anthony Paletta </div><div>980 words</div><div>5 August 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A18</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fortunes of Rockaway Beach have always risen and fallen like the tide, but never so dramatically as with superstorm Sandy, which wrenched much of its boardwalk out of place -- just one example of the destruction in the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A mere nine months later, Rockaway is sporting a new face, with much of the boardwalk reopened and studded with surprisingly sleek infrastructure. The city's Parks Department faced a herculean task in returning the beach to use, removing 430,000 tons of debris and tending to countless other restorative hurdles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the end result transcended a one-time fix and became something more, thanks to the creativity of the architecture firms that were hired to design the concessions stands, lifeguard stations and other city-owned structures that were destroyed by the storm. As Parks Commissioner Veronica White commented: "We determined that everything was going to be better and more resilient."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is the latest of many changes for the peninsula, which boasts the largest urban beach in the U.S. and an accordingly colorful history. The new structures pay tribute to Rockaway's rich history as well as the rebirth the beachfront was beginning to experience when the storm hit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the days of modern roads and railroads, Rockaway was a remote vacation retreat. Melville wrote: "Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy him a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach?" The opening of the New York, Woodhaven and Rockaway railroad ushered in Rockaway's boom decades after the turn of the century as an urban resort, an age of hotels, boardinghouses and the Rockaway Playland, one of New York's most prominent early amusement parks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the area began to go into decline around midcentury with New York residents heading off in their cars for more distant vacation locations. Almost like clockwork, a series of drab housing towers sprang up on beachfront property. Playland closed in 1985 and, in a seemingly inevitable pattern for former New York amusement parks, its site was turned to tower housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Proximity became an asset in recent years, as Rockaway began to revive with an influx of youth for whom the combination of a beach and subway access is a wonder, not a demerit. A bus line now runs from Williamsburg, delivering a steady installment of cutoff shorts to the ocean and to the area's fusiony food-stands each weekend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With all these crosscurrents, Rockaway became a realm of contrasts. There are the blocks of stately beach homes that make you forget you're in New York, then the bleak housing projects that remind you abruptly that you couldn't be anywhere else. A constant had been a tattered but recently lively boardwalk with glum concession stands and harsh lighting from the multipurpose-stadium era.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And suddenly, because of Sandy, there wasn't even that. "The boardwalk was blown into the community and people's belongings were down on the beach," Ms. White says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But then came the fix-up. Beach entrances had been destroyed, leaving the husks of several nondescript Robert Moses-era concession stands marooned along the boardwalk. Sage &amp; Coombe Architects was commissioned to rework these structures. Not content with merely devising a new paint scheme, the firm set out to "create three iconic entries to Rockaway Beach," says Peter Coombe, the firm's founding partner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our approach was to use super-graphic, bright colors that could be visual beacons and seen at some distance, distinct from the pre-Sandy color scheme, and build a number of sculptural sun screens to create needed shade and markers visible from the beach," Mr. Coombe adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sunscreens, a set of gossamer pergolas crimped to provide shade and visual interest, anchor these vibrant repainted stands and offer a charming and easy landmark both from the land and the shore. This easy transition is accentuated by new bleachers built between the boardwalk and the beach from salvaged post-storm material.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The concession stands have become perfect landmarks for a summer's day; the design for new restrooms and lifeguard stations at Rockaway, and at other city beaches, aims for something considerably more ethereal. Faced with the requirement of elevating these structures at a considerable height to avoid possible flood levels, Garrison Architects embraced not the stolidity of height, but its possible dynamism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These curved steel-frame structures elevated on pillars possess a mod aesthetic and a kinetic energy. James Garrison, their principal architect, cited the "anamorphic" qualities of Greek temples in Sicily as an inspiration. "I wanted them to hover above the sand, to be in action, to look as if they are moving to the ocean."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These structures look for all the world like the Scandinavian starfleet's first mission ended up not at Mars, but on our shores, boasting an elegantly curved steel frame and corrugated stainless steel shell and wood-like side panels crafted out of Taktl, an "ultrahigh performance concrete." They offer not only uninterrupted views of the ocean beneath, through the support pillars, but also a view of the ocean from a large window within -- in sharp contrast to the usual bunkerlike experience of beach restrooms. Typically housed in buildings about as routine as their function, here restrooms have become an irresistible visual element.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to all of this, Pentagram, a graphic-design studio, has developed a comprehensive signage plan for the beach, offering a crisp and coherent display of public safety information and location. If you've been prone to confusion in your beach wayfinding, take heart -- not only are there new signs out there, there are suddenly buildings along the boardwalk you won't easily forget.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Individual gifts that exceed $14,000 in a year must be reported to the IRS. A Jumbo Jungle column in the Mansion section on Friday incorrectly put the limit at $13,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(WSJ August 3, 2013)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having trouble making that down payment? Call your mother. Maybe she and dad can help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial experts say that parental help is best when the money is a gift, with no expectation of repayment. That is because loans from family members can create extra hurdles when a home buyer applies for a mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders typically view a family loan as another burden that could affect a borrower's ability to make monthly payments, said Tom Wind, executive vice president of residential and commercial lending at national lender EverBank. In fact, a loan from a parent could raise a borrower's debt-to-income ratio sufficiently to result in disqualification for a mortgage, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parental loans also fall under the category of unsecured debt, meaning that no asset is acting as collateral, which can pose a lending risk. Edward J. Achtner, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>'s senior vice president in north California and Oregon, said his company generally doesn't allow unsecured debt -- such as credit-card advances -- as a funding source for a jumbo mortgage down payment, Mr. Achtner said. To be considered, a loan from a relative would have to be secured with collateral such as a traditional secondary mortgage, counted toward the maximum loan-to-value ratio, and included in the underwriting process, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gifts -- with no strings attached -- are a different matter. Even then, EverBank and other lenders typically like to see home buyers contribute at least 10% of the loan amount to the down payment. "We are looking for borrowers to have their own equity in the transaction because that's an indication of their ability to manage their own finances," Mr. Wind said. "If someone is coming to the closing with a down payment that is all gift money, we'd consider it, but only on a case-by-case basis."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> generally requires borrowers provide at least 5% of the loan amount, Mr. Achtner said. And gift money is only acceptable for a down payment on a primary residence and not a second, vacation or investment home, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In making a family gift, the key is for the borrower to have the right documentation, including a letter that clearly states the gift amount and that the gift-giver doesn't expect repayment, Mr. Achtner said. In addition, lenders require written proof that the money has been transferred from the relative's bank account to the borrower's bank account or, alternatively, are given a copy of a certified or cashier's check, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If one has prepared for the gift correctly, it really doesn't impair the mortgage process at all," Mr. Achtner said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About one-fourth of all first-time home buyers receive some down-payment assistance from relatives, most commonly, parents, according to a National Association of Realtors survey of people who purchased homes from July 2011 to June 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers seeking jumbo mortgages -- loans above $417,000 in most parts of the country and $625,500 in high-cost areas -- may especially need the help. Not only is the loan amount higher, jumbos also typically have higher down-payment requirements -- at least 20% of the loan amount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising property values are also driving more parents to pitch in on down payments, especially in high-price home markets such as parts of California, Mr. Wind said. "Assuming the borrower can afford the monthly payment, it's a way for a child to take responsibility but for parents to help out," he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few more considerations when seeking help making a down payment:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Don't forget tax rules. An individual gift of $13,000 or less is tax-exempt, but gifts that exceed the $13,000 annual limit must be reported to the IRS. Each parent can give $13,000 to a child and his or her spouse, for a nontaxable sum of $52,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Stick to close family members. Lenders generally won't allow down payment gifts from distant relatives or unrelated parties, such as a builder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Gift rules are looser with an FHA loan. <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span> mortgage limits go above regular jumbo limits in some high-price areas and allow borrowers to use a gift for the full down payment.</p>

</div><div class="author">Ilona Billington </div><div>860 words</div><div>2 August 2013</div><div>04:30</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON—U.K. house prices rose to a five-year high in July as a controversial government support program fuels fears that another house price bubble may be in the making.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Help to Buy program supports buyers by offering cheaper mortgages but doesn't guarantee new housing supply. Help to Buy and increased home loans from banks using the separate Funding for Lending program enable home sellers to ask for higher prices for a short supply of residential property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That potential mismatch between demand and supply has prompted many economists to question the wisdom of the government's support programs, fearing that they may lead to a sharp rise in house prices that can't be sustained over the long run.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in house prices is in line with other indicators that suggest the U.K.'s long-awaited economic recovery is gaining momentum. A survey of purchasing managers at construction companies released Friday recorded a surge in activity during July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, with wage growth remaining below inflation, Britons are still seeing their real incomes falling. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research on Friday said that Britons are being forced to dip into their savings to maintain their living standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A reliance on rising house prices and spending that outstrips income growth would reprise the weaknesses that contributed to the economy's sharp contraction in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, the government and Bank of England have said they want to see a more balanced economy, with growth also driven by exports and increased business investment. But that rebalancing has yet to begin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"House prices are already overvalued, and with many first-time buyers already locked out of the market, it is unlikely they are happy at the prospect of having to take on even more debt to realize their homeownership aspirations," said Matthew Pointon, an economist at Capital Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Figures from mortgage lender Nationwide showed that U.K. house prices were 3.9% higher from a year earlier. The last time prices rose at a faster annual pace was July 2010, when they grew 6.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means the average price of a residential home in the U.K. was £170,825 ($258,270) in July, the highest since June 2008 when it was £172,415.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide's chief economist, Robert Gardner, said the rise came amid improving buyer confidence due to the recovering economy combined with support from the government's programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Help to Buy is designed to give first-time buyers of newly built homes an equity loan to help them secure a mortgage at a cheaper rate. It is also being extended to all buyers from January in the form of the government guaranteeing a proportion of the loan, again to help the buyer secure a more affordable mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while those programs boost demand for homes, it will take some time before supply of new homes increases, particularly in England's crowded southeast. For those who don't own their home, rental costs have been surging, leaving them less to spend on other goods and services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The supply side of the market remains fairly constrained," Mr. Gardner said. "The fact that rental growth has been consistently outstripping wage growth reinforces the notion that housing more generally remains in relative short supply."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in activity in the construction PMI to a more than three-year high suggests that house builders are beginning to respond to increased demand. Sterling rose on the data to a day high of $1.5175 from around $1.5140 before the data, while the euro fell to a day low of £0.8716 from around £0.8730.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that comes after a number of years when new home building was well below the levels needed to meet the needs of a growing population, which means the inadequate supply of property will continue to add upward pressure on house prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.K. house builders have reported healthy profits so far this year, with the Help to Buy program named as a driver of increased business. And, builders say they will increase their building activity in response to higher demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"During the first half of 2013, there has been meaningful improvement in the housing market, with more positive consumer sentiment, a more available and affordable mortgage market, and the presence of government mortgage schemes," said Pete Redfern, chief executive of builder <span class="companylink">Taylor Wimpey</span>. "We continue to open all new outlets with implementable planning permission."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.K. economy grew in the first two quarters of this year with consumer spending a key driver of that improvement. But there are concerns that the rise in spending won't be sustained, since it is not driven by rising real incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, new government figures showed the number of individual insolvencies rose in the second quarter from the first, reversing the recent falling trend, as the number of individuals seeking help with their debts rose sharply.</p>

</div><div class="author">Eleanor Warnock </div><div>537 words</div><div>31 July 2013</div><div>02:12</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TOKYO--Japan's efforts to reignite the long-dormant economy are translating into some improvements - including increases in employee earnings and housing starts - albeit incrementally and unevenly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher summer bonuses helped lift cash wages for Japanese workers slightly in June for the first time in five months, government data showed Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average total monthly cash earnings, including overtime and bonuses, rose 0.1% on year to 433,568 yen ($4,425) for employees at companies with five or more staff in June, according to data released by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Corporate earnings have improved because of the yen's weakening and gains in stocks," said Yuichi Kodama, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance</span>. "'Abenomics' is working to a certain degree."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in bonus payments may be a sign that some firms are heeding politicians' calls to increase some forms of compensation. It was the first time that special payments had risen for the month of June since 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, land ministry data showed housing starts for June jumped 15.3% from a year earlier, marking ten consecutive months of gains. The housing sector has benefited from growing expectations for higher borrowing costs ahead as the government and the <span class="companylink">Bank of Japan</span> attempt to alter deep-rooted expectations of deflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction orders soared 21.9% as public spending was channeled into various projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures show that the economic expansion the administration has helped engineer with stimulus spending and monetary easing has helped move some corporate profits to consumers' wallets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet economists say companies still aren't likely to raise actual salaries, a necessary step to sustain firm household spending. Moreover, their failure to increase pay could put a burden on households if the government achieves its goal of ending 15 years of falling prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In principle, a tighter labor market should be supportive of stronger wage growth," said Capital Economics economists in a note to clients, noting an increase in job opportunities and a drop in the unemployment rate in June. "But companies are likely to remain reluctant about raising base pay."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The wage increase was due to a 0.4% on-year rise in special payments such as summer bonuses, a sign that households may not yet be feeling a significant impact from the government's pro-growth policies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regular pay was down 0.2% from the same month the previous year, and overtime compensation was unchanged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most Japanese companies pay summer bonuses in June or July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some consumers are buying homes now because the government plans to raise sales tax in April and amid concerns that rising material costs will push up housing prices in the future. Contracts made by September aren't subject to tax hikes even if deliveries take place after April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keiji Takano, a spokesman at <span class="companylink">Mitsubishi Estate Co</span>., said the firm is currently sharing increased material costs with construction firms, rather than putting the burden on customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We actually want to pass on the (higher) costs directly," Mr. Takano said. "A condition for that is the income of purchasers needs to increase. Unfortunately, that's a next step." </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks slipped as investors awaited a flood of economic news slated for this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 36.86 points, or 0.2%, to 15521.97. The S&amp;P 500-stock index eased 6.32 points, or 0.4%, to 1685.33, and the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> Composite Index slipped 14.02 points, or 0.4%, to 3599.14.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with Monday's losses, benchmarks held much of their July gains. The Dow industrials are up 4.1% for the month, and the S&amp;P 500 has climbed 4.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're at a point where we're [about] halfway through earnings reports, and the market is up strong, and we're moving into August, which is a time when there's not a lot of corporate news," said Andrew Slimmon, managing director with Morgan Stanley Global Investment Solutions, which manages $2.4 billion. "That means the market is in for a breather here."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Monday's economic calendar was relatively light, traders are readying for a flurry of economic data this week, including second-quarter gross domestic product and the Federal Reserve's policy-setting committee statement, both due on Wednesday, as well as the Labor Department's monthly jobs report on Friday. "Markets in the U.S. are in wait-and-see mode," said David Lyon, San Francisco-based investment specialist with J.P. Morgan Private Bank, which manages $910 billion. "Equity markets seem a little bit tired, and [investors] are waiting for some of the numbers later this week."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, the National Association of Realtors reported that pending home sales for June declined 0.4%, missing expectations for a rise of 0.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid the week's deluge of data, investors expect the central bank to keep its highly accommodative policies in place, but they are eager for clues on when it might start scaling back its stimulus measures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economic reports will be especially important for investors trying to get a sense of whether the economy will be strong enough for the Fed to pull back, <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span>'s Mr. Lyon said. If Wednesday's GDP reading comes in below expectations, "you'll probably see markets react favorably to that news, because it keeps the Fed on hold" from a pullback, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In commodities markets, natural gas settled in bear-market territory -- defined as a drop of 20% or more from a recent high -- as expectations of cooler weather damped demand for the fuel. Natural gas fell 2.7%, to $3.459 a million British thermal units, off 22% from a 2013 high hit on April 19.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crude oil edged down 0.1%, to settle at $104.55 a barrel, while gold gained 0.5%, to settle at $1,328.40 a troy ounce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.588% as prices fell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early Tuesday, Japan's Nikkei average was up 0.1%, as the weaker yen offset disappointing factory-production data. South Korea's Kospi was up 0.4%, the Shanghai composite opened up 0.3%, while Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 was down 0.3%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales remain near postcrash highs. The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>' Pending Home Sales Index fell slightly in June, which the group warned could be a sign that higher mortgage rates are taking a toll on the housing market.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The solid housing recovery is supporting further gains in home prices, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller report released Tuesday. Two cities saw home prices hit new highs in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in 10 major U.S. cities increased 11.8% in the year ended in May, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home price index. Home values in 20 cities were up 12.2% on the year, compared to a 12.4% gain projected by economists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, the 10-city index increased 2.5% in May from April, and the 20-city index increased 2.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Individual cities saw even better progress in home values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in Dallas and Denver surpassed their pre-financial crisis peaks set in June 2007 and August 2006, respectively. "This is the first time any city has made a new all-time high," the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, five cities—Atlanta, Chicago, San Diego, San Francisco and Seattle—posted monthly gains of more than 3% for the first time, said David M. Blitzer, chairman of the Index Committee at S&amp;P <span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> Indices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices have been rising for more than a year. Low mortgage rates and stronger job growth lifted demand at a time when supplies of homes were relatively tight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent increase in mortgage rates could slow the uptrend in home prices. Some potential buyers may no longer qualify for a mortgage at the higher rates, and they may have to lower their price bids on a home in order to keep the monthly mortgage payments down to an affordable level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Averaged across all cities, the home price indexes have returned to levels last seen in the spring of 2004, but remain 24%-25% below the June-July 2006 peaks, said the report.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SYDNEY—The Australian dollar took a knock on Tuesday, after <span class="companylink">Reserve Bank of Australia</span> Chief Glenn Stevens appeared to green light another interest rate cut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a speech that was notable for its dovish overtones, Mr. Stevens said tame inflation means the bank can cut its cash rate, already at a record-low 2.75%, if needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was a significant remark to make just a week ahead of the bank's August policy meeting and sent the Australian dollar skidding. The currency—which was already under pressure from weak home building data released earlier in the session—fell to US$0.9070 from US$0.9162 when the central bank governor took to the podium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have been saying recently that the inflation outlook may afford some scope to ease policy further if needed to support demand. The recent inflation data do not appear to have shifted that assessment," Mr. Stevens said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Australia's inflation rate in the second quarter was 2.4%, well inside the central bank's desired 2% to 3% target range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As if to reinforce the point, Mr. Stevens said while a number of rate cuts since late 2011 are proving to be effective by helping to pump prime the non-mining sectors of the economy, that doesn't mean the bank won't cut again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are clearly signs of policy working in this respect, though not, to date, by so much that we see a serious impediment to further easing, were that to be appropriate from an overall macroeconomic point of view," Mr. Stevens said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Aussie was trading at US$0.9071 at 0540 GMT, compared with US$0.9248 in late Sydney trade Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It isn't unusual for the Aussie dollar to trade in big ranges, but Tuesday's fall came even as traders have already priced in a 75% chance for another 25 basis point interest rate cut next week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By all accounts it seems Mr. Stevens would be happy to see the nation's currency fall even further. He said its 10% slump against the U.S. dollar since April shouldn't have surprised anyone, given slower global growth and falling commodity prices. And further weakness from here should be expected, according to Mr. Stevens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The exchange rate seems to make sense from a macroeconomic perspective. It would not be a major surprise if a further decline occurred over time, though of course events elsewhere in the world will also have a bearing on that particular price," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The RBA has cut rates seven times since late 2011, in hope that lower borrowing costs will help stimulate weaker parts of the economy by boosting consumer spending on activities such as shopping and home building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far the impact of the rate cuts has been limited, with consumer demand still muted, business conditions at four-year lows and unemployment rising. Some recovery is evident in the housing market as property prices have risen and more home building permits have been issued, but economists have warned it isn't sufficient to offset the impact of the country's cooling investment boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said Mr. Stevens was very deliberate with his message.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Today's speech by the RBA Governor was fairly downbeat and confirmed that last week's inflation print was low enough to leave the RBA with further scope to ease policy," said Paul Bloxham, <span class="companylink">HSBC</span>'s Australia Chief Economist.</p>

</div><div class="author">Jason Chow </div><div>894 words</div><div>30 July 2013</div><div>08:46</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash-strapped governments are slashing requirements for visas and citizenship to attract wealthy Chinese immigrants in the hope of drawing capital to their shores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While investor immigration programs are technically open to all, immigration lawyers say that governments are targeting anxious Chinese who are looking for potential escape plans for their families and protection for their assets in case of turmoil at home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is an all-out immigration war emerging for the Chinese," said Jean-Francois Harvey, an immigration lawyer at Harvey Law Group in Hong Kong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best deals of the moment come from countries in the Caribbean and Southern Europe suffering from weak economies and heavy public debt loads. The attractions are visas or citizenship that allow for relatively unfettered travel and cheap real estate, either for investment purposes or for homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the eastern Caribbean, the island nations of St. Kitts &amp; Nevis and Antigua &amp; Barbuda are battling it out to attract immigrants. Both nations are struggling in a region wrecked by hefty public debt loads and anemic growth; the <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span> forecasts the Caribbean region's 2013 growth at just 1.25%</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">St. Kitts, a tiny island nation with a population of about 53,000 that lies 1,200 miles southeast of Miami, has led the charge in easing citizenship requirements in the region. Citizenship is granted to those who spend $400,000 on real-estate investment or donate $250,000 to the country's Sugar Industry Diversification Fund. A St. Kitts passport offers visa-free travel to most Western countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not to be outdone, Antigua &amp; Barbuda, St. Kitts's neighbor 70 miles to the west with a population of about 90,000, is set to launch its own program. Modeled on the St. Kitts program, an Antigua citizenship can be acquired for a limited time for a donation of $200,000 to the country's national development fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a niche product, but a niche product for China is still big numbers," said Hong Kong-based immigration lawyer Denny Ko, whose firm, Henley &amp; Partners, was hired by Antigua to help set up the investor immigration program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Antigua's program hasn't started yet—politicians are debating whether the country should require participants to live in the country for a number of days each year—the marketing for it has already begun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government officials in both Antigua and St. Kitts didn't reply to requests to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another battle over residency visas is playing out in Southern Europe. Greece's government is promising renewable five-year resident visas to foreigners who spend at least €250,000 ($328,000) on residential property—undercutting its neighbors' visa offers by at least €50,000. The program, which is about to be launched, offers visas that allow free travel in most of Europe for 90 days every six months. Portugal last year began offering a "golden visa" to foreigners who purchased a house valued at least €500,000, while Cyprus also launched a program for those who spent at least €300,000 on a property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Everybody in Europe is coming to us to sell their houses to the Chinese," said Hong Kong-based immigration lawyer Wendy Wong at S.W. Wong &amp; Associates who serves mainland Chinese clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman at the government agency Invest in Greece said that the lower price was intended to attract more residents to the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for government-run Cyprus Investment Promotion Agency said 1,000 properties have already been sold to Chinese investors, mostly in the coastal town of Paphos. "We can't comment on whether Chinese investors would be interested in Greece," he said. "We're focused on ensuring that the Chinese people who invest in and move to Cyprus are warmly welcomed," the spokesman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spain is planning a similar residency option but it hasn't released details.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for some Chinese investors, the visa isn't everything. Hungary last year began offering five-year residency visas to those who invest €250,000 in a special government bond program, but programs like these are less interesting to Chinese, who typically want to buy real estate for use as rental properties, vacation homes or simply leave them empty in hopes of a rise in housing prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The mentality among most Chinese is they look at the real estate first, and the visa second," said Mr. Ko. "Some just view the visa as a bonus."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wealthier countries are also eager to attract Chinese but the price is steeper. In the U.S., the cost is US$500,000 and the creation of a certain number of jobs. In the fiscal year ending September 2012, 80% of the 7,641 applicants to the program came from mainland China, according to data from the <span class="companylink">U.S. State Department</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Australia last November launched a "significant investor" visa that allows foreigners to settle for up to four years in exchange for a 5 million Australian dollar (US$4.6 million) investment into bonds, managed funds or equity investments. As of May, the country attracted 170 applicants, most of which are believed to be Chinese, representing a total investment of A$850 million.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another potentially market-moving event is the Federal Reserve's policy-setting committee statement on Wednesday. While the Fed is expected to keep its highly accommodative policy in place, investors are still eager for clues on when it might start scaling back its unprecedented stimulus measures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S.-listed shares of Irish biotech giant Elan rose 4% after the company agreed to be acquired by U.S.-based health-care products company Perrigo for $8.6 billion in cash and stock. Perrigo's shares slipped 6.3%.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Josh Mitchell   </div><div>533 words</div><div>29 July 2013</div><div>11:47</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of Americans signing contracts to buy previously owned homes slipped in June, a sign higher mortgage rates could slow housing-market momentum in coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Monday that its index of pending home sales fell 0.4% in June from a month earlier to a reading of 110.9. The pace of sales was still strong, with the slight drop coming after pending sales reached a six-year high in May. Pending sales in June were 10.9% higher from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the Realtors group said the June drop was likely a sign a rise in mortgage rates from May is starting to scare away some prospective buyers. The group said some people appeared to pull out of contracts for homes after rates rose sharply form when they initially signed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the latest data suggest that completed home sales will rise in August but could slow from there. "We think any further progress in the short term will be a real struggle, thanks to the surge in mortgage rates since early May," Mr. Shepherdson said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other reports recently have indicated the housing market remains strong. The Commerce Department reported last week sales of new homes rose 8.3% in June from a month earlier. Also last week, the NAR said sales of previously owned homes eclipsed the annual pace of 5 million for the second consecutive month in June, despite slipping from May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any slowdown in housing would cause concern for the U.S. economy, which has leaned heavily on the housing recovery and strong consumer spending in recent months to offset government spending cuts and weak exports. The government is set to report Wednesday how much the economy grew in the second quarter, and some economists believe the nation's gross domestic product slipped to an annual growth rate of below 1% in the April- through-June period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, said the pending home-sales report will cause a greater focus on housing in the coming months as the Federal Reserve ponders when to rein in its stimulus measures. "A genuine weakening in housing would encourage the Fed to delay tapering plans," Mr. O'Sullivan wrote in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates have slipped recently but are still nearly a percentage point above their level from May. For the week ended Thursday, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 4.31%, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. While still low historically, the rates—coupled with rising home prices—are threatening to price out many prospective buyers who may opt to keep renting instead of buying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, the NAR's chief economist, said that in addition to higher mortgage rates, pending sales were also being hurt by a "persistent lack of inventory." He warned closed sales could decline in coming months, though he said they would stay above year-ago levels.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON—The value of loans extended to British home buyers rose at the fastest rate in more than a year in June, suggesting a recent pickup in house prices will gather pace in the coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest evidence of rising demand for houses, at a time when few new homes are being built, is likely to unsettle some U.K. lawmakers who worry that a government program aimed at helping people secure mortgages will cause a bubble in house prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bank of England said Monday that the value of loans for house purchases rose by £981 million ($1.51 billion) in June, the sharpest rise since April last year. A total of 57,667 new mortgages were approved in June, a slight decrease from May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.K. Treasury chief George Osborne in April launched a mortgage guarantee program dubbed Help to Buy that gives financial support to first-time buyers. In January, the government will launch a second phase of the program, in which buyers will be able to secure mortgages with a deposit of just 5% of the purchase price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Concern over the scheme's impact on house prices is growing, however. Business Secretary Vince Cable said on Sunday on BBC TV, "I am worried about the danger of getting into another housing bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We mustn't risk returning to the problems of the last decade when housing got out of control."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Treasury last week moved to allay fears that property investors could take advantage of the program, confirming that people won't be able to use it to buy second homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in lending comes as house prices are increasing at their fastest rate in nearly three years. The latest figures from lender Halifax show house prices grew 3.7% on the year in June, up from 2.6% in May and the fastest rise since August 2010. The less timely official measure of house prices from the <span class="companylink">Office for National Statistics</span> shows that house prices grew 2.9% on the year in May, up from a 2.6% rise in April and the biggest rise since December 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts expect the gains to continue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is a very real possibility that house prices could surprise on the upside over the second half of in 2013, especially as a shortage of new properties for sale is currently providing support to house prices in some areas," said Howard Archer, chief U.K. and euro-zone economist at IHS Global Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The BOE also Monday showed lending to small businesses, including overdrafts, rose by £238 million in June, the biggest rise since the central bank's records began in April 2011. The increase gives support to lending figures released last week by the <span class="companylink">British Bankers' Association</span>. In May, BOE figures showed lending fell by £476 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">British officials have highlighted a lack of lending to small businesses as one of the biggest challenges facing the economy, so further evidence that the provision of loans to this key sector is improving will be welcomed.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time home buyers, long a key underpinning of the housing market, are increasingly getting left behind[http://online.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/article/SB10001424127887324144304578621784045469540.html] in the real-estate recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such buyers, typically couples in their late 20s or early 30s, have accounted for about 30% of home sales over the past year. They represented 40% of sales, on average, over the past 30 years, and accounted for more than 50% in 2009, when recession-era tax credits fueled the first-time market, according to data from the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The depressed level of first-time buyers could prove to be a drag on the housing rebound and the broader economic recovery over the longer haul. First-time home buyers are the foundation of the real-estate market and are major contributors to their local economies, often buying up older homes, revitalizing communities and spending money on furniture and renovations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once they have built some equity, they often move to more expensive residences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, first-time buyers accounted for 29% of purchases of existing homes, compared with 32% in June a year ago, according to the NAR's existing-home sales report.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal agency sent warning letters to the companies involved and said it could follow up by seizing the products, enjoining their sale and even criminally prosecuting firms whose officials fail to take corrective action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The products include dietary supplements, self-styled "natural treatments," and ayurvedic medicines, part of an alternative health system that evolved in India and includes herbs and special diets.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's turning out to be a rough year for home buyers. The inventory of properties for sale is low, prices are rising, and mortgage rates have spiked. And now the summer sales season is drawing to a close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houses aren't likely to get any cheaper during the second half of the year. But there are signs that the frenzied pace of sales that has given sellers the upper hand during the spring and early summer is settling down, helping buyers who have done their homework and are ready to pounce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories, while still low, finally are going up. Rising mortgage rates could sideline potential competition, even though costlier loans are making housing more expensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One thing isn't changing: bidding wars. In June, some 69% of homes faced multiple offers, according to data tracked by online real-estate brokerage Redfin, which operates in 18 states. That was down from a high of 76% in March, though still up from 64% last June and 50% two years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We saw a tremendous amount of bidding wars early in the year," says Anthony Lamacchia, a real-estate agent in Waltham, Mass., who has been in business since 2004. "It was more than I'd ever seen in my career."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the easiest way to win a bidding war is simply to pay top dollar, real-estate agents say there are steps buyers can take to make sure they get the best deal, ranging from securing a mortgage prequalification to moving quickly once they have decided they want to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past year, bidding wars have been most common in the entry-level market, where buyers have had to compete with investors for bargain-priced properties. But in high-cost housing markets throughout coastal California, New York and Washington, D.C., bidding wars on pricier homes have become more common.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far in 2013, home prices around the nation have risen at their fastest year-over-year pace in seven years. Values in San Francisco rose 26% in June from one year earlier, while Sacramento, Calif., gained 30% and Las Vegas rose 29%, according to estimates made by real-estate website Zillow. Other cities showing large gains include Phoenix (up 22%), San Diego (21%) and Orlando, Fla. (13%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in 2006, bidding wars helped send home prices to record levels. At the time, speculative home purchases and easy mortgage-lending standards inflated a bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's run-up is very different. It is being driven by rock-bottom mortgage rates, increased levels of investor purchases and an improving economy. "There's a lot of pent-up demand right now. People want to get their own place fast," says Glenn Kelman, chief executive of Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the number of homes on the market last month stood at its lowest level for the month of June since 2001. In June, there were 2.19 million homes available for sale, which was up by 1.9% from May but down 7.6% from a year ago, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another issue for buyers: Mortgage rates are rising after a long period of record lows. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, which stood at 3.59% in early May, has jumped to 4.58%, according to the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are some signs rate increases could cool heated markets. Until six weeks ago, for example, almost every offer Los Angeles-area real-estate agent John Venti made on behalf of his clients faced competing bidders. So far this month, five of his clients have signed contracts for homes without any competing offers. "Things have definitely softened up," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, in many markets, buyers are facing stiff competition. In San Francisco, for example, nine in 10 offers written by Redfin agents in June had at least one competing bidder, up from 83% a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So how can buyers win a bidding war without overpaying? Here are some tips to consider.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Know your area. The single best thing that buyers can do when they are involved in a bidding war, Redfin's Mr. Kelman says, is to know what is going on in their own neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many websites, including Realtor.com, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, Zillow and Redfin, allow buyers to search recent listings to see which homes have gone under contract and, after the sales are complete, the final price. Real-estate agents will also have access to multiple-listing-service data that show other real-time statistics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, Redfin data show that 40% of winning offers in San Diego were above the asking price. In San Francisco, that number was 92%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- When it comes to price, be realistic. Two years ago, when sales were still slow, buyers could sometimes get away with lowball offers. Now that things have heated up, make sure your initial bid isn't insulting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Syd Leibovitch, the president of Rodeo Realty in Los Angeles, advises his clients to make their first offer "as high as you can possibly go." Too often, he says, he sees clients lose homes to higher bidders but realize, in retrospect, that they would have been willing to pay the higher price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's very difficult to predict how high the other offers are going to go," Mr. Leibovitch says, so it makes more sense to bid your maximum right away than to try to base your offer on what other buyers might do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- At the same time, pick your "walkaway number" -- and stick with it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't get carried away by a frenzied bidding war, experts say. Heated back-and-forth offers can be exciting and competitive, and agents warn that it is easy to get carried away. What might start as just a few thousand dollars to top another offer could end up costing far more if buyers lose their head. Pick a number at the beginning of your search that is the absolute maximum and don't stray from it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you are getting a mortgage, lenders will set a maximum that you are allowed to borrow based on your down payment and your income. But outside of exceptional circumstances, you shouldn't be borrowing the maximum, says Keith Gumbinger, vice president at mortgage-information website HSH.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider how much of your income you are willing to apply every month for your mortgage payment, and don't forget about insurance and taxes. It also is important to have enough reserves to cover unexpected repairs and other housing expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you are paying cash, think about how that house matches up against your other investments. "Would you commit all of the funds in your portfolio to a single investment?" Mr. Gumbinger asks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Josh Benson and his wife have made offers on at least 10 homes since they began their search in Las Vegas late last year. While prices have risen, he says he is willing to be patient -- even though he needs more space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm super hesitant of buying into another little bubble," says the 33-year-old attorney, who bought a new house in the area in 2006 that is now worth about half of the $330,000 that he paid. Mr. Benson, who had two kids when he bought that property, now has four and wants to rent out his house and buy a bigger one with a larger yard in the same part of town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Be flexible on other offer terms. While price may be what matters most to a seller, being flexible on other selling conditions can set your offer apart. Let the sellers know if you are open to discussing closing dates and moving arrangements, or offering "rent back" to sellers who want to stay in their house beyond closing in order to finish out their children's school year or until they have bought another property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best way to figure out what kinds of things the sellers are looking for, experts say, is simply to have your agent ask.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In situations where sellers are eager to close as quickly as possible and get out of the house, consider waiving certain sales conditions, or "contingencies," that can hold up deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In markets like San Francisco, for example, it has become more common for buyers to waive requirements that homes complete a home-inspection or appraise at a certain value. In some cases, sellers also being offered "escalation clauses," a bubble-era tactic in which buyers agree to raise their offer to a certain point to beat out any competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eric Tan, a real-estate agent in Los Angeles, had clients who already had moved out of their home in Palos Verdes Estates, Calif., and closing the sale quickly and painlessly was their top priority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The winning offer was just over the asking price of $985,000 at $1.025 million. But the bidders also agreed to waive their right to an inspection after making a bid and instead had the house inspected before putting in their offer -- eliminating the risk that they would pull out of the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seller also made sure all paperwork was in order from the get-go, Mr. Tan says, which speeded up the process; other prospective buyers' papers were incomplete and would have taken weeks to come through.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Once you know you want to buy, don't dawdle. After losing four other bidding wars, Meredith Bolton moved as quickly as she could on a two-bedroom house in Waltham, Mass. She and her husband saw the house the morning after it hit the market and within an hour, they made an offer of $400,000, which was $10,000 over the asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We wanted to get to it before they even had an open house," says Ms. Bolton, a 31-year-old kindergarten teacher. The tactic worked, and they closed on the house in early July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Get prequalified. If you are getting a mortgage, be sure to get prequalified by a bank. If mortgage rates continue to rise, you will need to get reapproved, says Mr. Lamacchia, the real-estate agent, because sellers will want to know that the rate increase hasn't pushed you out of their price range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jan Spak, an agent at Rodeo Realty, recommends getting prequalified by not one but two lenders, especially if you are looking to buy on the higher end of the market. Ask the seller's agent if they have any trusted lenders they would prefer. "You want to do everything you can to show you have the ability to close," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Decide what you will do if the home appraisal is below the asking price. A deal can fall apart if the property appraisal comes in below the agreed-upon price. When that happens, buyers will have to put down more cash to save the deal. This is a big reason why sellers prefer all-cash offers, as well as those where the buyer can make a large down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, sellers would sometimes turn down offers that appeared "too good to be true," Redfin's Mr. Kelman says, worrying the buyers might back out because they didn't have enough cash to make up the difference between the offered price and the appraisal value. Brett Dickinson, an agent at <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span> in La Jolla, Calif., advises his clients to demonstrate their ability to make up the difference if they are serious about getting the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Benson, the Las Vegas attorney, raised to $380,000 from $365,000 an offer he had made for a four-bedroom home, but the seller said he only would accept the increase in cash. Mr. Benson says he wouldn't agree and that the home eventually sold to someone else for $360,000. "That's what you're dealing with out here right now," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Position yourself as a backup in case another buyer pulls out. In this market, it isn't unusual for sales to fall through because of low appraisals, difficult buyers or for other reasons. If you really like a property, have your agent communicate your interest even after another bid has been accepted, says Mr. Dickinson. If the buyers pull out, you could be the first in line to get the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Connect with the sellers. Consider another boom-era tactic: writing a letter introducing yourself to the seller and making a personal appeal, says Carrie Georgitsis, a real-estate agent on Chicago's North Side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Offers often look the same on paper, and you want to set yourself apart. While sellers aren't going to take a lower offer because of a letter, it could make a serious offer stand out against the competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Abe Shivadas, a 33-year-old engineer in San Diego, made his first offer on a house in December. It was accepted, but the bidding process seemed too easy. Sure that there was a better bargain available, he and his wife decided to pull out of the sale and keep looking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then the market turned, and they lost their next offer to a higher bidder. By this past spring, they had lost more than a dozen bidding wars, Mr. Shivadas estimates, and were still without a home. "It was extremely frustrating," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shivadas's first offer was a simple sheet of paper listing the price he and his wife wanted to pay. By May, they had added multiple favorable conditions, such as waiving their right to an inspection, and added mortgage preapprovals from two different lenders and a letter describing their family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shivadas and his wife finally closed on a four-bedroom home in March. Of the 25 other bidders at the initial price, $590,000, they were among seven to offer an additional $50,000. It was the letter, Mr. Shivadas believes, that set them apart; they wrote about their hopes that their 3-year-old daughter, Anya, would grow up in the home.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Katy McLaughlin </div><div>1853 words</div><div>26 July 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Steven and Robin Fine started searching for a place in Latin America to spend their early retirement, they looked at spots in Mexico and Costa Rica, both popular destinations for American retirees. On a trip two years ago, they decided to stop by Panama, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We thought we would like Panama the least," Mr. Fine, 51 years old, a former communications executive said, "but we liked it the best."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The combination of luxury apartment buildings, good restaurants and modern hospitals drew the couple to Panama City, where 1 1/2 years ago they spent $1.1 million, plus about $250,000 on renovations, on a 48th-floor penthouse with a view of the Pacific. It is now their full-time home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Central American nations of Panama, Belize and Nicaragua are increasingly competing with Costa Rica and Mexico for North American retirees and second-home buyers. New luxury developments, outfitted with spas, restaurants, marinas and golf courses, are on the rise. Builders say they are using more high-end materials and adding upscale amenities designed to appeal to affluent American buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These countries offer packages of residency and breaks on taxes and fees that imitate Costa Rica's pensionado program, which was introduced in 1971 and helped set the groundwork for a boom in retiree emigration from North America. Nicaragua added such a law in 2009, offering foreigners with retirement incomes tax breaks on everything from cars to construction materials. Last year, Panama, which has a long-established retiree program, created a path to citizenship for retirement residents and introduced a new residency program for people under retirement age that has lowered requirements for investment in property, business and other ventures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The message of this law is simple," said Panama City-based attorney Manoj Chatlani of Panama Offshore Legal Services. "It's 'Come to Panama.'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of Americans who collect Social Security in Panama jumped 65% to 2,164 between 2006 and 2011, the latest year for which there is information. In Nicaragua, the figure more than doubled in the same period, from 595 to 1,322. Belize's number, too tiny for the <span class="companylink">Social Security Administration</span> to track in years past, was 560 in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Panama's explosive growth -- gross domestic product increased by an average of 8.5% annually since 2008, according to <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span> estimates -- has drawn American workers and businesses to Panama City over the past decade. Now, local developers are courting another population, focusing on building amenity-rich planned communities outside the city to appeal to North American retirees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boquete, a town about 40 miles from the Costa Rican border, offers high-end gated communities, an established expat community, cool mountain temperatures and tropical-rainforest landscape. Justin Harper, co-owner of Playa Chiquita Development Corp., is developing about 200 acres of virgin land 20 miles east of Boquete. The community, Bella Vista del Mundo, has 76 lots and plans for a boutique hotel, spa, pools, tennis courts and horseback trails. Single-family homes with mountaintop and Pacific Ocean views can be built by the developer for about $400,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Hatton Urriola, 43, moved to Boquete three years ago from Kansas and set up Panama Connection Real Estate, which provides tours, relocation help and real-estate sales to expats. Among properties he is currently marketing is a 6,716-square-foot house on 34 acres, once used as the summer home of Panama's military leader, Manuel Noriega, who is serving a 20-year sentence in El Renacer prison in Panama City. The house, listed at $2.3 million, is a 25-minute drive from where an international airport is being expanded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the east side of Panama City, a 700-acre community called Santa Maria Golf &amp; Country Club is being built to include 4,000 colonial-style houses, townhouses and condominiums, and a golf course designed by Jack Nicklaus's company. The homes, yet to be completed, sell for about $278 a square foot, a "top price" in Panama City, said Kent Davis, broker at Panama Equity Real Estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Santa Maria is a product that hadn't existed in Panama before: the luxury suburban community -- more American-style larger lots," Mr. Davis said. Most pre-delivery buyers have been Panamanians; local agents say they expect American interest to rise as the development nears completion in five to 10 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Belize, a small, English-speaking nation with a population of about 330,000, has been popular for years as a scuba-diving and ecotourism destination. High-end properties had to be custom-built until the early 2000s, when developers started putting up "single homes here and there," said Hugo Moguel, president of the Association of Real Estate Brokers of Belize, which is launching the country's first multiple-listing service in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, developers are attempting to sell Belize as a luxury-living place to retire. New developments include Sanctuary Belize, a 14,000-acre development slated for completion in three years that will have 2,000 residential lots, 250 condominiums and townhouses, and a 220- to 250-slip marina. The buildings' poured-concrete construction meets Dade County, Fla., hurricane-resistant standards, said Luke Chadwick, a partner in Eco-Futures Development. Developer financing is available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 600 lots Sanctuary has sold so far, 80% of them have been to Americans, he said. The core demographic is "50 to 65 year olds, either in retirement or planning for retirement," Mr. Chadwick added. Lot prices range from $149,000 to $1 million for an acre overlooking the Caribbean, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom and Tricia Herskowitz moved into their 7,000-square-foot compound in Sanctuary this past September, lured by the boat slip and Caribbean access. "The fact that the country is English speaking and is a Commonwealth country was attractive to us," said Mr. Herskowitz, 68, a retired executive and business-school professor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid growing tourism -- and aided by the lowering of a foreigner transaction tax in 2006 -- there has been a boom in luxury-condo developments, especially on the island of Ambergris Caye, popular with expats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are beachfront condos going up that are going to feature elevators, which didn't exist in Belize before. Most of the buyers are baby boomers and they are aging," said Dmitri Ioudine, owner of Coldwell Banker Ambergris Caye Ltd. Local builders say building materials have improved as local suppliers bring in higher-end materials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite their inroads with American retirees, these countries still don't attract the same numbers as more established destinations, such as Mexico and Costa Rica. In 2011, more than 50,000 Americans collected Social Security in Mexico and more than 5,000 in Costa Rica. But Mexico's well-publicized drug war and escalating violence are starting to push Americans to look at new places for retirement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Central America, however, has its own problems with crime. The <span class="companylink">U.S. Department of State</span> labeled the crime rate in Nicaragua "critical" and the murder rate in Belize "extremely high," though concentrated in Belize City and not in tourist areas. In Costa Rica, petty crime such as theft and "smash and grab" muggings have increased in the past couple of years, along with home invasions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Panama remains relatively safe when compared with other Central American countries, yet crime rates are higher than one would encounter in most of the United States," says the State Department's 2013 report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dan Prescher, who leads conferences by International Living, a provider of information for people interested in retiring abroad, says urban crime rates can exaggerate safety issues in other areas of a country. Still, he warns that public security isn't always adequate in the region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nicaragua is the latest country to attempt to grab North American interest. In Guacalito de la Isla, a 16,070-acre coastal development -- with 600 residences, a pool, restaurant and gym -- is under construction. A two-hour drive from Managua's international airport, the project includes a plan to open a small airport by 2015. The first homes -- 28 single-family houses -- will be turned over to owners in September. The four-bedroom, four-bath pool houses sold for between $700,000 and $750,000, said Jeff Lawrence, director of real estate. A luxury hotel-resort on the property, Mukul, opened in January and has helped boost sales, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The buyers right now are 85% Nicaraguan and 15% U.S. based," Mr. Lawrence said. "There is an education hurdle for us to convince people that Nicaragua is safe and is a tropical paradise."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RETIREE VISA PROGRAMS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These Central American countries recently have either rolled out or refined retiree-residency programs that allow foreigners to reside in the country, and offer tax breaks and benefits. Here are some basic program details:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PANAMA</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Program: Turista Pensionado</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Income requirement: $1,000 monthly from a retirement fund, Social Security or trust fund that provides lifetime income</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Duty-free imports: Household goods up to $10,000 in value</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vehicle fees: Tax-exempt importation of a car every two years</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other benefits: Turista Pensionado holders, regardless of age, receive many discounts, including 50% off movie and sporting-event tickets, 25% off restaurant meals and 30% to 50% off hotels. Last year, Panama introduced a separate residency program called Friendly Nations that makes it easier and cheaper for nonpensioned people to establish residency; previous programs required significant investments in the country. Friendly Nations requires having at least $5,000 in a Panamanian bank account, plus demonstrating economic activity in the country, said Panama City-based attorney Manoj Chatlani, of Panama Offshore Legal Services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BELIZE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Program: Qualified Retired Persons</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Income requirement: $2,000 a month income from pension, annuity, Social Security or investments</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Duty-free imports: No duties charged on household goods of unlimited value</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vehicle fees: Duty-free import of a car, which can be up to three years old, every two years</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other benefits: Boats, light aircraft and any personal belongings can be brought in duty-free. The Association of Real Estate Brokers of Belize said it is lobbying the Belizean government to make it easier and faster to qualify for the QRP program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NICARAGUA</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Program: Residentes Pensionados</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Income requirement: $600 monthly income from a retirement account or $750 in private income/investments, plus $150 more per dependent</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Duty-free imports: Household goods up to $20,000 in value</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vehicle fees: No import tax on a personal vehicle, which can be up to seven years old, valued at $25,000 or less</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other benefits: You can buy a car locally and avoid the import and sales taxes locals have to pay. "I had a client recently who bought a Honda CRV for about $23,000. With the taxes, it would have been nearly $32,000 here," said Managua-based attorney Paul Tiffer.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Terry Johnson sold his penthouse in Midtown Manhattan for $7 million last year in a deal that included practically all the furnishings -- right down to the kitchen sponges, toilet brush and two jars filled with M&amp;Ms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They wanted my liquor in my liquor cabinet, my spatula, my knife," says Mr. Johnson, who is an investor in an auto-related business. "I thought when people bought stuff in a place it was just the furniture."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, the deal was contingent on the inclusion of almost everything in his home, all itemized in 140 lines in the contract, says Ryan Serhant, Mr. Johnson's agent. The buyers were pharmaceutical consultant Charles Stiefel and his wife, Daneen, according to public records; they didn't return requests for comment. Mr. Johnson walked away with only a few possessions: his sheets and towels, a 3-D wall-art hanging and an antique Asian statue that he bought while traveling in Thailand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In real estate, it is said, everything is negotiable. And these days, buyers want "turnkey" properties, where they can close the deal on a Tuesday and sleep in their new home Tuesday night. The buy-it-all trend is particularly popular among international buyers and celebrities, who don't want to wait for shipping containers to cross the ocean or for their own decorator to redo the entire home. "They want to be able to move in and not have to deal with all the little details," says New York-based real-estate consultant Lori Ordover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many sellers are just fine with the arrangement, especially when it means a faster transaction without the hassles of moving. "Some sellers view it as a fresh start and are really willing to walk away with almost nothing," says Beverly Hills agent Jade Mills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, the more details there are to hammer out, the more instances for deals to fall through. Brokers say tussles over chandeliers, custom drapery and artwork can ruin multimillion-dollar transactions. "In a seller's market, if people want specific things, it could hurt their chances," says Eric Hantman, CEO of Prime NYC Real Estate in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Mills' first all-inclusive sale was to an actress who bought a 7,900-square-foot home with six bedrooms and six bathrooms in the Beverly Hills Post Office neighborhood for $7.2 million a few years ago. In the deal, her client, whom she declined to name, got the sheets, towels, dishes, drapery, pots and pans and more, adding about $250,000 to the price. "She even wanted the live Christmas tree," Ms. Mills says of her client, since the home closed about two weeks before the holidays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late last year, Michelle Boquiren, a sales director at an asset-management firm, was moving to New York from London. She toured a model apartment at the Cammeyer, a former shoe factory in Manhattan's Flatiron District that had been converted into 67 units, and liked the 800-square-foot condo. Although she had schlepped her Room &amp; Board furniture across the Atlantic, she says the game changer for her was that the condo had almost everything in it already -- soap dispensers, cotton-ball holders, towels and damask bedding from <span class="companylink">Restoration Hardware</span>, trash cans, a huge mirror in the bedroom, even magazines and several houseplants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The day after she closed for $975,000, she laundered the sheets and slept in her new home. "I was relieved that I didn't have to piece things together or wait for things to be delivered," Ms. Boquiren says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building's broker, Mr. Hantman, says the developer was willing to sell most of the furniture and accessories because there were only a handful of available homes remaining that would need to be staged. The only things the developer wouldn't sell were certain lighting fixtures, a flat-panel TV and the marble wine-bottle holder, which were on loan from home-design companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, developers are increasingly offering fully outfitted units as more buyers want them. The <span class="companylink">Ritz-Carlton</span> Residences, Singer Island, Palm Beach, for example, has started offering turnkey packages for buyers that include towels, alarm clocks, hair dryers, Bulgari toiletries, table linens and mixing-bowl sets, among other things. Of the 15 condos that have sold during the past year, eight of those have been sold with these turnkey packages, which cost about $10,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Alex Soltani, founder of private-equity firm <span class="companylink">Skyview Capital</span>, and his wife came across an 8,000-square-foot modern home in Beverly Hills with five bedrooms and seven bathrooms their intention wasn't to purchase it "100% complete," Mr. Soltani says. But they liked warm contemporary design and furniture. Their old place had a Mediterranean vibe, and most of the furniture and decor wouldn't work in this space. So they decided to ask for the sheets, china, artwork, remaining bottles of wine in the wine cellar, furniture and other accessories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We had our own sheets but just continued to use theirs after we gave them a good scrub," Mr. Soltani says. "With our first born and a second on the way, we didn't want to spend our time decorating and furnishing a place." Mr. Soltani estimates that everything included raised the sales price about $500,000; he says he paid between $10 million and $15 million for the home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Negotiating an all-in sale can be tricky; each item up for grabs must be inventoried and included in the term sheet. Mr. Serhant, the New York agent, spent at least six hours photographing each item of Mr. Johnson's the Krups coffee machine, the candles over the microwave, the assorted throw pillows and then itemized each and every thing that would be included in the sale. "It all had to be documented; the mattress, the box springs, every single fork," Mr. Serhant says. "I kept thinking, 'This is where I earn my commission.'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other brokers hire home-inventory companies, which traditionally document personal property for natural disasters, insurance reimbursement or legal issues, such as a divorce. Ms. Mills, the Beverly Hills agent, has worked with Home Sweet Home Video, a high-end home-inventory company in Pacific Palisades, Calif., that charges a minimum of $375 per 50 items to take pictures of what is included in a home sale. Owner Amy Reiss says she goes room by room with her clients to discuss what needs to be inventoried and delivers a report that includes manufacturer model and serial numbers, along with an item's location and category.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some agents and bank executives say it is best to negotiate the purchase of furnishings separately from the sale of the home. For one, many lenders won't cover personal property in the home mortgage, but would consider a separate loan for, say, artwork, says Jim Minich, managing director of capital advisory services at <span class="companylink">Harris myCFO</span>, a wealth-management company. That is because an appraisal, which is required before securing a loan, doesn't take into account personal property. "The appraiser instantly deducts the value of the furniture, so you rarely get the extra value you think you've obtained," Mr. Minich says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, David Benveniste, CEO of Velvet Hammer Music and Management Group, sold his Beverly Hills home to an Indonesian buyer for $7.425 million. In a separate transaction, he sold the same buyer, who declined to be named, many of his custom housewares. Initially, the buyer planned to bring in his own designer, Mr. Benveniste says. But in late June, the buyer asked to purchase his rugs, mirrors, marble dressers, custom bed frames and other furniture and accessories. "You cannot have my art and you cannot have my dogs, but everything else is negotiable," Mr. Benveniste says he told the buyer. In the end, the majority of his furnishings were included in the separate $200,000 transaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pat and Roseann McGeehin's 8,200-square-foot home in Potomac, Md., is on the market for $3.45 million, with the option to buy most of their furnishings for an additional sum. Mr. McGeehin, senior managing director at FTI Consulting, says he and his wife are willing to part with their sommelier cups, four sets of flatware, the African birthing stool they got on a trip to South Africa and an antique 7-foot clock from a Philadelphia bank, among other things. The only things they want to keep, such as the yellow ceramic pig in the kitchen and a tall torch lamp in the music room, have sentimental value and can be used in their other homes in Palm Beach, Fla., Bethany Beach, Del., and condo in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Manhattan property, which they bought in May for $2.4 million, came fully furnished, including the sheets, towels, picture frames, dishes and silverware. "We were trying to avoid all that additional stress," he says. "The day we closed, we slept there."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite even the hardest negotiations, sometimes a buyer or seller won't budge on personal property. About a year ago, Ms. Mills represented a couple selling their contemporary 4,000-square-foot home on the Sunset Strip in the Hollywood Hills. Each time the buyers visited, they commented on the owners' white Maltese poodle. During the last inspection before closing, Ms. Mills says the buyers asked if the dog could be included in the sale. "My sellers couldn't believe they asked for their dog," Ms. Mills says. "They were serious about it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home ended up selling for $4.3 million -- sans poodle.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anya Martin </div><div>900 words</div><div>26 July 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyer is ready to buy, and the seller is ready to sell. Then comes the low blow: The home is appraised below the contract price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lower-than-expected appraisal typically means a borrower must come up with a higher down payment or lose the deal, said Allen Cravello, president of American Capital Corp., a mortgage lender and broker in El Segundo, Calif. A possible recourse, albeit one with slim chances, is a formal rebuttal letter, also called a reconsideration letter, prepared by the borrower or loan originator, with input from a real-estate agent or an appraiser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evidence of incomplete or inaccurate work can persuade a lender to assign a new appraisal, giving the borrower another chance to qualify at the desired loan amount, said Mathew Carson, a mortgage broker at <span class="companylink">First Capital Group Inc</span>. in San Francisco who was an appraiser before switching to lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Appraisal problems can have a big impact on a transaction. In May, 9% of real-estate agents reported a contract cancellation, 10% reported a delay and 13% experienced lower sales price negotiations due to a low appraisal, according to the National Association of Realtors' existing home sales survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To challenge an appraisal, borrowers should make their case with the commissioning lender, said Michael Vargas, president of New York-based Vanderbilt Appraisal Co., which specializes in high-end homes. Lenders, however, are prohibited from communicating directly with appraisers, under the Home Valuation Code of Conduct (HVCC), rules enacted by Congress in 2009 to reduce mortgage fraud. Therefore, the lender will commonly send the borrower's rebuttal to an appraisal-management company, a third-party entity that hires appraisers, for review.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key to successfully rebutting an appraisal is leaving emotions at the doorstep, Mr. Vargas said. A rebuttal needs to be limited to factual errors, flawed methodology by the appraiser and/or additional new or missed "comps," which are recently sold homes that are comparable to the home that is for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the housing crisis, comps were sometimes hard to find, and appraisers often included foreclosures or short sales. However, with home sales improving, it is now worth pulling more comps to see if an appraiser missed something, said Sara Benson, president of Chicago-based <span class="companylink">Benson Stanley Realty</span> who has successfully overturned low appraisals of upscale homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, because appraisers use Multiple Listing Service data typically accessible just to real-estate professionals, it is highly recommended that the borrower hire a review appraiser or expert local real-estate agent who has access to the same data, Ms. Benson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Appraisals of luxury homes should be detailed and display a higher level of specialized knowledge than those for conventional homes, said Chip Wagner, an appraiser in metro Chicago. "The appraiser must have a grasp on the newest technologies, the highest quality materials and upper-end appliances and how they contribute value," he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, home aesthetics also are subjective, so upgrades shouldn't be overemphasized in a rebuttal, Mr. Wagner said. He said he recently appraised a $3 million home with a foyer done in expensive Italian tile, but he heard later that the new owners immediately ripped it out when they remodeled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The people who can afford to buy high-end homes can also take out those high-end features," he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One common issue cited in recent rebuttals has been the quality of the initial appraiser. Many real-estate agents and lenders say that experienced appraisers, who in the past worked independently and set their own rates, left the business when HVCC regulations made them subcontractors for appraisal-management companies, where they took a substantial pay cut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This exodus resulted in less experienced appraisers who may come from miles away and not be familiar with the property area, Ms. Benson said. Mr. Carson said he has seen AMCs send appraisers from Sacramento, Calif., to assess a San Francisco home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A borrower who can prove that the appraiser lacked market familiarity, experience or had a history of disciplinary issues can cite these facts as grounds to disqualify an appraisal, Ms. Benson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rebuttal report should include data, exhibits and professional opinions to support any errors in the appraisal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Benson recommends stating at beginning and end that if flaws and discrepancies aren't addressed and promptly corrected, the appraiser will be reported to the licensing board for further investigation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To add impact, have the rebuttal professionally bound by a print shop or copy center. Copies should be sent to all involved parties in the transaction, including the loan officer, underwriter, bank president, buyer's and seller's attorneys and agents, buyer, seller, appraisal management company and the appraiser whose work is being challenged, Ms. Benson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How to Challenge a Low Appraisal</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When an low appraisal jeopardizes a home loan, borrowers can write a rebuttal letter:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Letters are usually drafted by the borrower, with help from the real-estate agent and a hired appraiser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Stick to the facts, avoiding emotional pleas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Include data, exhibits and professional opinions to support claim of errors in the appraisal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- State that if flaws aren't promptly corrected, the appraiser will be reported to the licensing board for further investigation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Have the rebuttal professionally bound and sent to all the parties in the transaction.</p>

</div><div class="author">Lucy Craymer </div><div>466 words</div><div>24 July 2013</div><div>21:09</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WELLINGTON, New Zealand—New Zealand's central bank held its policy interest rate steady Thursday and ruled out an increase this year, but rising costs of housing and construction may force it to act early in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Reserve Bank of New Zealand</span>, though it kept the official cash at 2.5%, caught the market off guard with a slightly hawkish tone and tightening bias.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We expect to keep the OCR unchanged through the end of the year," Gov. Graeme Wheeler said in the post-decision statement, but added "removal of monetary stimulus will likely be needed in the future."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That phrasing shows a "clear tightening bias," said Annette Beacher, head of Asia-Pacific Research at <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New Zealand dollar rose almost to a five-year high against the Australian dollar after the decision, and market odds that the bank will raise rates by next March jumped to 92% after the decision, from 76% beforehand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If those bets are correct, New Zealand would likely be among the first developed nations to tighten monetary policy since the financial crisis began.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Zealand's economy is faring better than many of its developed-nation counterparts, with nine quarters of consecutive growth, manufacturing expanding at its quickest pace in nine years in May and consumer confidence hitting a three-year high in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While neighboring Australia's mining industry has suffered from the slowdown in China, New Zealand's exports of dairy and meat have fared well as Asia's growing middle classes move to a higher-protein diet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Growth in the New Zealand economy is picking up and although uneven, is becoming more widespread across sectors," Mr. Wheeler said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subdued inflation has allowed the central bank to keep rates at record lows since March 2011. The second-quarter consumer price index was up 0.7% from a year earlier, its lowest reading since 1999 and below the central bank's target of 1%-3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But rising housing prices and construction costs, as resources are stretched by post-earthquake rebuilding in Christchurch, look to be key drivers of policy. Home prices in New Zealand's two largest cities have hit record highs due to a combination of low interest rates, a growing population in Auckland and the need to replace homes lost in the Christchurch quakes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"<span class="companylink">Westpac</span> has long held the view that rising house prices and the construction boom will provoke inflationary pressures, requiring an OCR (official cash rate) hiking cycle that is much larger than the RBNZ has been forecasting," Westpac chief economist Dominick Stephens said. "The RBNZ now seems to be coming around to that way of thinking."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Carmel Melouney   </div><div>559 words</div><div>25 July 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hamptons housing market showed renewed strength in the second quarter as property sales in the Long Island summer playground rose 25.2% over the year-earlier period, a new report shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were 675 sales in the second quarter, the highest number of sales in any quarter since 2006, according to the report being released on Thursday by <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a big jump," said Jonathan J. Miller, president and chief executive of real-estate appraisal firm Miller Samuel Inc., who prepared the data for <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hamptons sale prices also increased, with the median price going up by 8.2% to $920,000 in the latest quarter from $850,000 in the same period in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was the second highest median level for prices in any quarter in five years. The quarterly market peak for median prices was $1.1 million reached in the second quarter of 2007. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We saw a lot more activity above $1 million, but not at the extreme high end," said Mr. Miller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller said there have been fewer sales above $5 million this year because these sales were poached during last year's fourth quarter when there was a flurry of sales as sellers sought to avoid capital-gains tax increases. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the luxury sector, defined as the highest 10% of deal prices for all Hamptons house and condo sales, the average was down 11.7% to about $7.1 million while the median price fell 18.6% to about $5 million. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Brennan, <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>'s Hamptons regional manager, believes the decline in $5 million-plus sales this year is related to interest rates. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The rumblings of interest rates beginning to go up are affecting people so they're jumping in now, but that price bracket is where people need financing," said Mr. Brennan, referring to the $5 million-plus category.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The city is hot as a pistol but out here, we haven't seen huge interest in spending lots of money for a summer place," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across Long Island excluding the Hamptons and  North Fork,  residential property is slowly and steadily recovering, with the total number of sales increasing by 15.3% to 5,281, according to the <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price edged up 1.4% to $355,000 in the second quarter compared with the year-earlier period, and the latest average sales price increased 3.7% to $439,116. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of second-quarter sales increased in all Long Island areas, except the Sandy-ravaged South Shore of Nassau County, which saw a 17.6% decline. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In North Fork, a very small submarket of Long Island, housing prices were up across all segments and sales volume increased by 16.8% in the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median North Fork sales price increased 10.8% to $459,750, while average sales price increased 4% to $679,720.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The region, especially the Hamptons, has been running parallel to the city," said Mr. Miller. Long Island, the Hamptons and North Fork all had "double-digit gains, and they all moved in the same direction and saw an uptick in prices, an increase in activity and a decline in supply," he said. </p>

</div><div class="author">By Sarah Portlock and Josh Mitchell   </div><div>318 words</div><div>25 July 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>7</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes surged in June as would-be buyers appeared to shrug off higher mortgage rates, maintaining momentum for a key driver of the economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales increased 8.3% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 497,000, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. That was the highest level since May 2008. Sales were up 38.1% from a year earlier. Economists had expected homes would sell at a 485,000 monthly pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales jump comes amid a sharp increase in mortgage rates. The rates for a 30-year fixed loan began rising in late May and are now up about a full percentage point to an average 4.58%, according to <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span> data also released Wednesday. That's down from 4.68% a week earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates affect new-home sales more quickly than sales of previously owned homes because the new-home figures are measured when a buyer signs a contract to purchase a new home. Existing-home sales figures reflect closings 30 to 60 days later, on average, after a contract is signed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some builder analysts have said the impact of mortgage rates on June home sales could be muted because builders will sometimes provide a break on interest rates to buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other analysts see signs that home buyers are tentatively working through the higher rates. "The strong rise in new-home sales in June means that the housing market has come through its first major test of higher mortgage rates unscathed," said Paul Diggle, property economist at Capital Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising rates could encourage some potential buyers to move quickly before prices increase further, and economists say many prospective homeowners would find higher rates to be affordable despite higher payments.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average mortgage rates dropped for a second week in a row amid recent strong homes-sales data for June, according to mortgage-finance company <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Freddie Mac Chief Economist Frank Nothaft said the latest decline should help alleviate concerns about a potential slowdown in the housing market.Mortgage rates rose sharply late last month on concerns about the future of the Federal Reserve's stimulus program that have since abated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Thus far, existing home sales for June were the second highest since November 2009 and new home sales were the strongest since May 2008," Mr. Nothaft said. "In addition, the low inventories of homes for purchase are putting upward pressure on house prices."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the week ended Thursday, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 4.31%, compared with 4.37% the previous week and 3.49% a year earlier. Rates on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 3.39%, compared with 3.41% a week earlier and 2.80% a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five-year Treasury-indexed hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages, or ARMs, averaged 3.16%, compared with 3.17% the previous week and 2.74% a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One-year Treasury-indexed ARMs averaged 2.65%, down from 2.66% the previous week and 2.71% a year earlier. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">U.S. Treasury</span> bond prices extended losses to a second consecutive session, sending benchmark yields to the highest levels in two weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market was hit by upbeat economic releases in both the euro zone and the U.S., while supply pressure continues to weigh on bond prices. A sale of $29 billion in seven-year notes is due Thursday, the last leg of this week's $99 billion new supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is a perfect storm for the bond market," said Michael Franzese, senior vice president of fixed-income trading at ED&amp;F Man Capital Markets in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late-afternoon trade, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was 18/32 lower in price, yielding 2.584%, according to Tradeweb. Bond prices fall when their yields rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The selloff underscores how the market is vulnerable to liquidation by bond holders at a time when anxiety over rising interest rates remains elevated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For months, investors have been nervous about prospects that the Federal Reserve, a main buyer of bonds, may start reducing purchases before the end of this year. The 10-year yield hit a 23-month peak of 2.756% earlier this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's strong housing data added to anxiety about reduced support from the Fed. New home sales rose to the highest level in five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke reiterated this month that the outlook for the central bank's bond-buying program depends on upcoming economic data. That means any positive data would fan anxiety that the central bank could inch closer to reducing its monetary stimulus for the economy. It has been buying $85 billion in Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities each month since January 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for safe assets pulled back as well, as a key survey of business outlook in the euro zone returned to expansionary territory for the first time since January 2012. The data raised hopes that the region's struggling economy, stung by the sovereign-debt crisis over the past few years, could claw its way back from a recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro-zone data also sparked a selloff in <span class="companylink">German government</span> bonds, which along with Treasury bonds are the leading safe-harbor debt markets in the world. The yield on the 10-year <span class="companylink">German government</span> debt, commonly known as bunds, jumped by about 0.10 percentage point to 1.648%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The German bond market "has completely broken down," said Tom Tucci, managing director and head of Treasury trading at <span class="companylink">CIBC World Markets Corp</span>. "This is weighing on the U.S. market as there is no real demand in the 10-year and 30-year sector of our market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher yields did boost foreign demand for a sale of $35 billion in five-year notes Wednesday afternoon, but demand overall was average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The five-year notes were sold at a yield of 1.41%, basically in line with the 1.408% traded right before the auction. That signaled demand matched what dealers had expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The highlight was the 53.9% indirect bid, the highest since November 2009. The category is a proxy of foreign demand, suggesting foreign investors deemed the May-June selloff as overdone and the yield an attractive buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other demand gauges were less impressive. The direct bid, which includes buying from U.S. investment funds and some broker-dealer firms, was 8.3%, compared with the average 14.4% from the past four sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dan Mulholland, head of <span class="companylink">U.S. Treasury</span> trading at <span class="companylink">BNY Mellon Capital Markets LLC</span>, said the 10-year yield isn't likely to break above 2.75% ahead of next week's release of the July nonfarm jobs report, a key data point that may influence the Fed's timing in tapering its bond-buying program.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last summer, when Jeff Blau, chief executive of Related Cos., was approached by a young vice president with what he saw as a great buying opportunity, no one at the company thought it would trigger one of the fiercest commercial real-estate brawls in years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The battle, which is headed for a showdown this week, pits Related, controlled by billionaire <span class="companylink">Miami Dolphins</span>-owner Stephen Ross, against the Portnoy family of Boston, which controls a property empire worth more than $20 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also shines a spotlight on the world of real-estate investment trusts that are run by external management companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was one of these REITs that caught Related's eye: <span class="companylink">CommonWealth REIT</span>, a Newton, Mass.-based landlord that owns more than 300 U.S. office buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last summer, Related officials realized CommonWealth's shares were trading at a steep discount, in part, it said, because investors and analysts didn't like that it was managed by an outside company. The Portnoy family, which controls CommonWealth, also owns the outside company, <span class="companylink">Reit Management &amp; Research LLC</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My initial response was, I don't believe it," Mr. Blau said in an interview, describing his surprise at how undervalued the stock was. "It's a public company. The markets are pretty efficient. . . . [The vice president] came back about two weeks later and said, 'No, I'm telling you . . . the assets are worth much more than the stock price.'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, Related and a partner, hedge fund Corvex Management LP, started amassing what eventually would rise to a 9.6% stake in CommonWealth in a bid to shake up management or gain control of the company. Related has said in public filings that 70% of CommonWealth's shareholders had voted by June in favor of a measure to oust the company's board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Portnoys have been resisting the effort, throwing up numerous legal roadblocks. "They're using the cloak of corporate governance when they're really wolves in sheep's clothing," said Adam Portnoy, president of CommonWealth, referring to Related. "We believe Corvex and Related are trying to seize control of this company, without paying for it, in order to misuse CommonWealth."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, an arbitration panel will hold a hearing on one of CommonWealth's strategies to resist takeover, which could go a long way toward determining the winner. The issue before the panel is the technical question of whether CommonWealth's board, controlled by the Portnoys, had the right to change its bylaws to prevent all but large, long-term shareholders from calling for its ouster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the battle is being closely watched because it has amplified criticism of so-called externally managed REITs. Unlike most REITs, which employ their own management team, these companies pay outside companies hefty fees to manage operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, RMR's fees from managing CommonWealth have risen to $69.8 million in 2012 from $60.2 million in 2007, according to the company. Over the same period, CommonWealth's total stock price return has underperformed the Nareit Office Index, a common benchmark of office landlords, by 36%, according to Green Street Advisors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Externally managed REITs have long come under fire for alleged conflicts of interest between the companies and the management firms they hire. The Portnoy family controls four more of this type of REIT besides CommonWealth, which it founded in 1986.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the case of CommonWealth, a group of dissident shareholders led by Related and Corvex point out that RMR gets paid fees based on much property the REIT owns, regardless of whether the buildings are profitable. That has led to bad investments for CommonWealth that have earned more fees for RMR nonetheless, they say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dissidents also point to CommonWealth's decision this spring to reinstate a director after shareholders voted him off the board. "In all my experience doing this, I've never seen a company's managers have such blatant disregard for shareholders before," says Keith Meister, founder and managing partner of Corvex, and a former deputy to activist investor Carl Icahn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CommonWealth's board and RMR say the external management structure saves investors money by sharing the cost of accounting, engineering and planning between CommonWealth and the four other REITs that RMR manages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RMR blames the company's underperformance in the stock market on a long, painful transition the company has launched from owning mostly suburban office buildings to owning mostly urban ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Commonwealth has always been -- and continues to be -- committed to doing what's in the best interest of shareholders," says Mr. Portnoy, who along with his father Barry, runs RMR and is on the board of the REIT.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The takeover effort comes as office-building values are rising as a recovering economy drives rents and occupancies higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, there are about 18 externally managed REITs in the U.S., excluding REITs that invest in mortgage-backed securities, according to Green Street. But recently, the structure has begun to spring up again, including in the mortgage REIT sector and the nascent industry of REITs that focus on buying and renting out single-family homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These guys are the dinosaurs of this industry," Mr. Sullivan says. "It's a company that's been providing terrible total return to their investors. There are incentives to make the company bigger, whether or not that's good for shareholders."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As evidence of a conflict, Related executives point to CommonWealth investments like Heritage Landing. In 2004, the company paid about $61 million for the early 1980s-built office complex in Quincy, Mass., a middle-class suburb about 7 miles south of Boston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The complex's only tenant, <span class="companylink">State Street Corp</span>., left in 2010 and it sat vacant since then. CommonWealth sold the property earlier this year at a loss, for $16.3 million, but RMR continued to collect fees from the property as long as CommonWealth owned it, critics say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The younger Mr. Portnoy counters that the Quincy example "demonstrates why we wanted to move away from suburban office" properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is one building . . . that didn't work out," Mr. Portnoy said. "For every one of these buildings like Quincy, there are numerous examples of buildings that created significant shareholder value."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Congress begins considering how to replace <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the real clash over the look of the mortgage market will be fought by two competing interests: business and real-estate groups that want to preserve a federal backstop and antigovernment libertarians who want to eliminate it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One part of the fight is now coming to a head as the <span class="companylink">House Financial Services Committee</span> on Tuesday began voting on a bill to wind down the government-controlled mortgage-finance firms and create a mostly private market, with Republicans on the panel mostly lined up in favor and Democrats uniformly opposed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently, Republicans and Democrats have struggled to address how the country should revamp Fannie and Freddie, which together with federal agencies have been backing around nine in 10 new loans. The Obama administration hasn't put forward any detailed plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bill in the House has strong backing from conservative academics who say the U.S. would be better off with a mostly private mortgage market. Republicans endorsed that approach when they reclaimed the House of Representatives in 2010, fueled by a surge of tea-party conservatives unhappy with the government's response to the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The House measure "gets government out of the way, helps increase competition, enhances transparency and gives consumers more freedom to choose the mortgage that's right for them," Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas), the chairman of the House finance panel, said on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bill has attracted strong opposition from home builders and real-estate agents because steps to raise the cost of mortgage lending could hurt their ability to sell homes. Also, the measure has provoked concern within the financial-services industry because the elimination of Fannie and Freddie could degrade the deep, liquid credit markets that attracted an array of investors to fund U.S. mortgages, particularly 30-year, fixed-rate loans that banks don't like to hold on their books and which don't exist in many other countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This bond market, which also allows homeowners to lock in a mortgage rate weeks ahead of closing on a loan, has functioned over the past five years only because Fannie and Freddie have received nearly explicit backing from the federal government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The people promoting this bill seemingly either don't understand mortgage finance or they simply don't care. It's purely an ideological exercise," said Scott Simon, who retired in May as a managing director at bond giant <span class="companylink">Pacific Investment Management Co</span>., or Pimco, a unit of <span class="companylink">Allianz SE</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Simon, a self-described "Reagan Republican," says that he wouldn't design from scratch the mortgage market that has taken root in the U.S. over the past 40 years. But he said the types of changes proposed would require home buyers to make significantly larger down payments for loans that would carry higher rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bill would do far more damage to the economy than the Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul law, which has been frequently criticized by Republicans, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some analysts have said that the House effort could help steer whatever compromise ultimately emerges. "The stronger the House's position, the more they can pull the bill in their direction," said Mark Calabria, director of financial regulation studies at the libertarian <span class="companylink">Cato Institute</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Calabria, who supports the bill, played down critics' worries that the 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage would disappear. "It's not a question of whether it goes away, but whether it goes from 70% of the market to 40% of the market," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the debate over the House bill has fallen largely along party lines, recent efforts in the Senate have bipartisan backing, giving them greater odds of success. Last month, eight senators -- four Republicans and four Democrats -- introduced a bill that would also wind down Fannie and Freddie over five years, replacing the companies with a new system that provides for guarantees of certain mortgage-backed securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists have said that an additional challenge facing efforts to privatize most of the U.S. mortgage market is that it could further consolidate lending in larger institutions. That's because mortgage lending relies to some degree on building economies of scale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This will in effect solidify and exacerbate 'too big to fail,' " said Frank Sorrentino, chief executive at the $1 billion-asset ConnectOne Bank in Englewood Cliffs, N.J.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Dawn Wotapka </div><div>851 words</div><div>24 July 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FORT MEADE, Md. -- An apartment community being built on this military installation offers service members an attractive alternative to living in barracks and enduring cramped rooms with twin beds, windowless kitchenettes and shared showers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it opens to tenants, scheduled for December, Reece Crossings will be the Army's first privately built, on-base apartment community for single lower-ranking enlisted men and women.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike typical barracks, Reece Crossings will have more than 800 beds in spacious one- and two-bedroom units with private bathrooms, full-size kitchens, washers and dryers and large living rooms. The complex will have a pool, videogame kiosks and fitness facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The development is a gamble for developer <span class="companylink">Corvias Military Living</span>, an affiliate of privately held Corvias Group, East Greenwich, R.I. The company is funding the entire $72 million construction tab and is required by the Army to recruit tenants on its own, leaving it at risk of unfilled beds. Service members also have to demonstrate enough responsibility and maturity to receive approval to live in the community, an Army spokesman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By agreeing to develop the building without government help, Corvias says its wants to convince the military that "there's a need for this type of housing" and that the private sector is the group to do it, said John Picerne, chief executive of Corvias. "With the unrest across the globe, our service members deserve a higher quality of life and a space where they [can] enjoy their time off [and] their time with others."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developers believe many service members will jump at the opportunity. Although traditional barracks are free of charge, soldiers who want to live in private housing will receive a monthly housing allowance, which in most cases should cover the cost of the private housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reece Crossing will charge monthly rent of $1,296 a person for each bedroom in a two-bedroom unit -- roommates can be chosen or matched via a questionnaire -- and $1,624 for a one-bedroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal is the latest example of military installations, which were long run like isolated communities, many with their own private grocery stores and schools, turning to private developers to make up for budget cuts that have left little money available to update or replace aging buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in an era of budget cuts, lenders and developers say installations are a safe bet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We feel good, in the long-term viability of these bases," said Jamie Fox, an Army veteran and a banker with Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch, which has underwritten roughly $8.6 billion in the past 10 years for military-housing privatization programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Privatization took off in the late 1990s, when the government faced a $30 billion repair tab for the military's family housing. Developers of the family housing typically sign 50-year leases that can be renewed with the government and spend their own funds or assume debt to remodel and build new homes. Developers collect management fees, and the service members pay rent from their monthly housing allowance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Military families generally like the change. Boxy, bland residences have been replaced by stylish communities that could have been built by a traditional home builder. Some units in Fort Meade's Potomac Place neighborhood, built by Corvias, resemble the popular Federal-style town houses found in the nation's capital. Developers put up family centers with videogame rooms and fitness facilities and they often take care of mowing the lawns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with most of the military's family housing now privatized, developers are looking to upgrade other military properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> recently completed a $465 million loan to Lend Lease, a large global developer, to build and renovate thousands of outdated hotel rooms at 39 Army bases, including Fort Meade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rooms will be operated like a traditional hotel under the Holiday Inn Express, Candlewood Suites and Staybridge Suites brands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Why couldn't you do that with mess halls?" Mr. Fox asked. Or "the gym?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It isn't clear how many private barracks will be built. Such units typically house single or unattached service members who are often young and don't necessarily require or demand lots of amenities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the need for new barracks isn't dire. Of the nation's nearly 325,000 beds for single and unattached service members, 85% are in good condition, said John Conger, the senior Department of Defense official who oversees global military installations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Reece Crossings shows opportunities will arise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fort Meade, a growing hub for intelligence and cybersecurity, doesn't have enough beds, forcing more than 1,000 service members to live off base and endure long commutes to work, said Col. Edward C. Rothstein, Fort Meade's garrison commander.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Base leaders wanted more beds but couldn't secure funding from the military. Reece Crossings was an "outside the box" solution, Col. Rothstein said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HANOI—Vietnamese President Truong Tan Sang embarked from Hanoi Tuesday on his first-ever visit to Washington, where he and President Obama will work to bolster economic and military ties--even as those relations will be tested by U.S. concerns over Vietnam's human-rights record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sang's visit is only the third official presidential visit between the two countries since diplomatic relations were established in 1995 and comes at a pivotal time for Hanoi and Washington. Vietnam is struggling with a slowing economy and rising disputes with China over territories in the South China Sea, while the U.S. increasingly sees Vietnam as a key economic and strategic partner in a region where an ascendant Beijing is exerting its influence. But Vietnam's crackdown on dissident bloggers and Web activists has complicated relations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While it thinks regionally, Vietnam itself is evolving politically," Murray Hiebert, senior fellow and deputy director of the Sumitro Chair for Southeast Asia Studies at the <span class="companylink">Center for Strategic and International Studies</span> in Washington, said in a recent report. "Sang's visit comes at a particularly critical time at home. The government is struggling with how to allow more political space for its citizens, who have become empowered through the economic benefits of its reform efforts."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Upon announcing Mr. Sang's visit on July 11, the White House said that Mr. Obama welcomed the opportunity to discuss economic, trade and strategic issues with Mr. Sang, while adding that Mr. Obama "looks forward to discussing human rights" with the Vietnamese president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sang, who is scheduled to meet Mr. Obama at the White House on Thursday, said last week that he believes such discussions must be rooted in mutual respect. Vietnam, he said, "respects and promotes the fundamental rights and freedom of the people."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sang faces a certain amount of pressure at home to work through differences with Washington amid growing worries over China and economic troubles. Vietnam's export-driven economy has taken a hit from continued global slowness, and many in the country are eager for closer ties with the U.S., the country's second-biggest trading partner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Five years after entering the <span class="companylink">World Trade Organization</span> and experiencing recent global financial crisis, Vietnamese leaders have realized that they should learn more from the U.S. to be able to overcome economic challenges as the country wants to head to the market economy," said economist Vuong Hoang from DHVP Research &amp; Consultancy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vietnam's economy grew 5.03% last year, the slowest pace in 13 years, and the government devalued the local currency, the dong, for the first time last month after holding it flat since November 2011. The government said it expects 5.5% GDP growth for this year and 6% for 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hoang said there is strong potential for an economic boost from increased trade with the U.S., especially if Vietnam joins the U.S.-led Trans-Pacific Partnership free-trade pact as expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two-way trade of goods between Vietnam and the U.S rose to a record $24.5 billion in 2012 from $21.5 billion in 2011, in which Vietnam posted a trade surplus of $14.8 billion in 2012, up from $12.4 billion in 2011, according to Vietnam government data. In the first half of 2013, Vietnam reported a trade surplus of $8.3 billion, up 20% on the year. Bilateral trade is expected to hit $33 billion in 2015 and reach $50 billion by 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China remains Vietnam's largest trading partner, but territorial disputes in the South China Sea between Hanoi and Beijing have escalated in recent months, leaving Vietnam eager to find support elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Vietnam has often said it dislikes being in a position to choose China or the U.S., but obviously a majority of the Vietnamese dislike being bullied by China in the South China Sea-related issues," Mr. Hoang said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sang recently completed a trip to China, where he met President Xi Jinping. A joint statement released during the visit refrained from mentioning the territorial disputes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have time and again reiterated that Vietnam would not ally itself with one country to counter another," Mr. Sang said last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, defense relations between Hanoi and Washington have increased steadily in recent years. And the Obama administration has responded to regional concerns over China's assertive posture announcing a strategic "pivot" toward Asia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vietnam and the U.S. stepped up cooperation with their first high-level defense dialogue in August 2010, and the two countries have discussed bilateral cooperation in a number of areas. In June, Vietnam's army chief of general staff and deputy defense minister visited the Pentagon and met with the U.S. joint chiefs of staff chairman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, Mr. Sang suggested that the U.S. should lift its ban on the sale of lethal weapons to Vietnam, the Associated Press reported. When asked about the ban, Mr. Sang replied: "It is now the time for our bilateral relations to be fully normalized in all fields," according to AP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But concerns over Vietnam's restrictions on free speech and its arrest and prosecution of dissident writers and bloggers continue to test relations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are a long list of court cases awaiting judgment in Vietnam," said Hanoi lawyer Tran Vu Hai. "But I believe that President Sang can help reduce them as he has the special mandate to pardon or give amnesty to those people, to show that Vietnam has goodwill in dealing with concerns raised by some U.S lawmakers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hai said according to <span class="companylink">Reporters Without Borders</span>, authorities are holding 35 bloggers and Web activists, with the latest arrest including the writer and blogger Pham Viet Dao in Hanoi on June 13.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Many of those arrested are people demanding two rights: To voice against Chinese violations of Vietnamese sovereignty in the South China Sea and to protest against policies and state personnel which hurt their interests, benefits and rights," Mr. Hai said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">International advocacy group <span class="companylink">Human Rights Watch</span> said Tuesday that Vietnam's crackdown on free speech should be a key topic of discussion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If criticizing the Vietnamese government is a crime, President Obama should show solidarity with dissidents by committing the crime himself," said John Sifton, Asia advocacy director at <span class="companylink">Human Rights Watch</span>. "President Sang cannot publicly justify his government's crackdown and should use this occasion to repudiate it."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Josh Barbanel   </div><div>1078 words</div><div>22 July 2013</div><div>21:54</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Long Island City, a renovated property on 51st Avenue has just received several purchase offers for around $3 million, brokers say, potentially setting a record price for a townhouse in Queens. In Park Slope, a restored townhouse on 10th Street found a buyer after a single open house. It was listed for just under $2.7 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such experiences are becoming more common in a newly resurgent housing market across New York City this year: Recent gains in other boroughs are outpacing those in prime Manhattan neighborhoods, where the market rebounded sharply last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new report by the Real Estate Board of New York, an industry trade association, found that city-recorded sales of homes outside of Manhattan, including condos and co-ops, rose 13.4% during the second quarter, compared with the same period in 2012. In Manhattan, overall sales were flat in the latest quarter, the report found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Excluding condos and co-ops, the pickup for one-to-three-family houses was even stronger. A total of 4,486 sales were recorded outside of Manhattan in the second quarter, a 20.5% increase over the year-earlier period. The largest sales rebounds were in Staten Island and Brooklyn. In Manhattan, where there are few one-to-three-family transactions, the number of sales still rose in the latest quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report found that some of the worst-performing areas were Sandy-damaged neighborhoods such as Howard Beach and the Rockaways in Queens, and Midland Beach in Staten Island. But even there, brokers say, pricing in some areas has stabilized, as bargain hunters stepped in to buy both renovated house and some still needing repairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Slattery, the board's senior vice president for research, said that sales outside Manhattan slowed down sooner than Manhattan in the housing slump and were slower to recover. Instead, he said, the city pattern excluding Manhattan more closely resembles that of the single-family-home market across the country, where low interest rates and growing confidence in the economy sparked a housing recovery this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Outside Manhattan the bounce back has been more recent," he said. The report put the median price of a one-to-three family house at $458,000, a price that showed that despite a stronger market, "the middle class can afford to live in New York City," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Manhattan, sales of homes selling for more than $10 million fell to 22 in the latest quarter from 40 in the first quarter and 30 in the 2012 second quarter, according to the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, Manhattan remains the prime market driver, making up 58% of the $8.2 billion in residential transactions filed with the city in the second quarter while the borough has only 18.5% of the owner-occupied housing stock in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the city's housing recovery is far from complete. Real Estate Board figures show that average prices in the second quarter were still 5.5% below prices recorded in the second quarter of 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that isn't worrying Doron Zwickel, a broker at CORE with the listing for the townhouse on 51st Avenue, a prime location in Hunters Point in Long Island City. The 21-foot-wide brownstone with six bedroom, bare brick walls and oak floors was listed for $3.25 million in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said that as a string of high-rise rental buildings went up near the East River in recent years, some renters have started looking for bigger homes in the same neighborhoods. With the supply of townhouses limited, prices have been pushed higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Talking about buying a property for $3 million here is no longer a profanity," Mr. Zwickel said. "We have gotten tons of interest and multiple offers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rebekah Witzke moved with her husband and three children to a Long Island City rental from the Upper East Side last year. Working with Jonna Stark of Nest Seekers International, she has been searching for a house but says everything she has seen is too expensive or needs too much work. "The inventory is so low and everything is going so quickly," Ms. Witzke said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Park Slope, prices and sales are rising. The report found that the median price in the neighborhood was $1.75 million in the second quarter, up from $980,000 a year earlier. There were 36 sales recorded in the second quarter up from 24.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house at 418 10th St. in Park Slope that listed for just under $2.7 million was 18 feet wide and was renovated with a sweeping main staircase and a fancy kitchen opening out on the garden. It went on the market in late June and immediately attracted attention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you've got something nice and if it's priced right, it is going to get a lot of attention and multiple offers," said Carol Graham, a broker at <span class="companylink">Corcoran Group</span> who has the listing. "But you still can't be stupid about pricing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Howard Beach, where the storm flooded many homes, the number of sales fell sharply in the latest quarter and the median price per square foot fell 30%, according to the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There was a lot of panic selling; there was a big scare factor," said Jerry Fink, a broker based in Howard Beach. But Mr. Fink said prices had stabilized and have begun to rise in some parts of the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You still have a great neighborhood," he said. Now that memories of Sandy begin to receded he said some buyers see the storm's aftermath as a buying opportunity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But on the south shore of Staten Island, where repairs on many Sandy-damaged houses are incomplete, would-be sellers are finding buyers only by dropping prices, while prices are rising in many other intact Staten Island neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Midland Beach, a newly renovated house on Patterson Avenue a few blocks from the water went on the market in April for $349,000, close to what it sold for in 2009. Since then, the asking price has been cut twice to $329,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Prices are very low," said Dritan Gashi, a broker with Robert DeFalco Realty who has the listing. "People are worried about Sandy, but when the price is low there is interest."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Conor Dougherty and Dawn Wotapka </div><div>1185 words</div><div>23 July 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time home buyers, long a key underpinning of the housing market, are increasingly getting left behind in the real-estate recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such buyers, typically couples in their late 20s or early 30s, have accounted for about 30% of home sales over the past year. They represented 40% of sales, on average, over the past 30 years, and accounted for more than 50% in 2009, when recession-era tax credits fueled the first-time market, according to data from the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The depressed level of first-time buyers could prove to be a drag on the housing rebound and the broader economic recovery over the longer haul. First-time home buyers are the foundation of the real-estate market and are major contributors to their local economies, often buying up older homes, revitalizing communities and spending money on furniture and renovations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once they have built some equity, they often move to more expensive residences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"First-time buyers are important to get the housing market to move to a new plateau," said Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist with <span class="companylink">Mizuho Securities USA Inc</span>. "Without them, you just get stuck at a marginal recovery environment."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Malik Benyebka is among those having a hard time getting in. Mr. Benyebka, a 40-year-old tennis coach, now rents a three-bedroom home in San Marcos, Calif., which he shares with his wife and two daughters. They are looking to purchase a similar home in the same area, for around $450,000, but have thus far lost out on all their bids -- in one case to a buyer who offered all cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, Mr. Benyebka and his family are sending letters to owners in hopes of tugging at their heart strings. "It's pretty much, 'We have two daughters. We are a family, we work hard, we're first-time home buyers trying to get a house in this neighborhood,'" Mr. Benyebka said of his letter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, first-time buyers accounted for 29% of purchases of existing homes, compared with 32% in June a year ago, according to the NAR's June existing home-sales report released Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report found that overall, sales of existing homes fell 1.2% in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.08 million. While that was down from a revised 5.14 million in May, it was up 15.2% from June 2012 and was the second-highest level of sales since November 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national median existing-home price was $214,200 in June, up 13.5% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, the sharp price gains that have been a hallmark of the housing recovery in many markets could moderate as mortgage rates rise, a point that would likely reduce competition among buyers. But for now, the housing market's brisk rebound over the past few years has exacerbated a familiar problem for many first-time buyers: financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People in the first-time home-buyer demographic are more likely to be unemployed, underemployed or have a spouse unemployed, to have lingering student debt, a less-established credit record and weaker credit scores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between January and June, the median credit score for first-time buyers was 720, below the 750 for repeat buyers, according to information collected for the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>' Confidence Index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, no-money-down mortgages and other products that were popular before the mortgage crisis have largely disappeared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, lenders have become much more cautious, scrutinizing appraisals, incomes and the sources of borrowers' down payment funds to guard against potential legal liability should mortgages default.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time buyers are also competing for lower-priced properties with investors who can often pay cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent jump in mortgage rates is another hurdle, raising monthly payments that could squeeze first-time buyers' budgets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though extremely low by historical standards, the interest rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage was at 4.68% for the week ended July 12, up a full percentage point since early May, according to the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>. At 3.68%, the monthly payment of principal and interest -- but not taxes and insurance -- on a $200,000, 30-year fixed-rate loan is $918. At 4.68% the payment jumps to $1,035.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Appraisals remain an issue: Cash buyers need not worry if nearby comparable sales come up short, but a first-time buyer might have to come up with the difference between their offer and the appraised value for the deal to close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span>, which insures loans with down payments of just 3.5%, has significantly boosted its insurance premiums over the past two years, which has raised the cost of buying for homeowners without a lot of cash for a down payment</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some communities, first-time home buyers are nearly absent. Anne Williams, a Realtor in Knoxville, Tenn., said she hasn't closed a single home for a first-time home buyer so far this year. Usually she has closed about five or so by this time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With fewer first-time home buyers in the market, home builders have increasingly targeted the move-up segment, a group that can typically afford to spend more on a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-building giant <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton Inc</span>., which is building more higher-end homes, saw its share of first-time buyers slip in its fiscal second quarter to 47% of closings from 49% a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fort Worth, Texas, company is building homes that start at $1 million at its Veneto at Positano community near San Jose, Calif., a far cry from the affordable entry-level homes that helped it become the nation's largest home builder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"About two years ago, we began to experience increased demand for larger homes . . . and we realized the move-up buyer was back in the market," said President and Chief Executive Donald Tomnitz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company's average delivery price in its second quarter was about $242,500, up about 10% from the prior year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Their business model is very driven by volumes, and you have to go to where the volumes are," said David Goldberg, a home builder analyst with <span class="companylink">UBS</span>. "It's just a question of where demand is. They'll build whatever home they have to."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enrique Jauregui, a financial analyst with a private-equity group, has been searching for his first home in Miami for about six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His price limit of $200,000 and his need for financing makes it impossible to compete with buyers -- many of them from outside the U.S. -- who are paying cash, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The way I've seen it, is that cash is king today. Sellers are hesitant to use anyone who is using financing," said the 24-year-old, who is renting a one-bedroom condo in Key Biscayne. "It is disappointing. I don't have an ability to move forward."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Josh Mitchell </div><div>769 words</div><div>23 July 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of Americans living in someone else's home for economic reasons rose in the past year despite an improving labor market, posing a challenge for the housing market and the broader recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of so-called missing households -- representing adults who would be owning or renting their own home if household formation had stayed at normal rates since the recession -- has increased 4% over the past year, according to an analysis for The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are now some 2.4 million such people, many of them living with their parents, but also seniors living with their adult offspring and people renting rooms in a home headed by an unrelated person.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John O'Connor, a 26-year-old lawyer in San Francisco, is one of them. Mr. O'Connor has split time at the homes of his mother and father in the Bay Area the past four years while attending the Hastings College of Law at the University of California, where he graduated last summer. He landed a job at a local firm, but has opted to stay with his parents to avoid paying the city's high rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. O'Connor estimates that renting a decent one-bedroom apartment would cost him $25,000 a year, after taxes. Staying with his parents has given him more spending money and enabled him to start saving for a down payment on his own home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Ultimately, I think the price is right -- you've got all the amenities of living at home that you wouldn't have otherwise," Mr. O'Connor said of living at his parents' homes. "The washer and dryer at your place, the full kitchen all the time, and you're not living that rugged lifestyle. You get to eat steak and not ramen."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The analysis on missing households, performed using census data by Jed Kolko, chief economist of real-estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia Inc</span>., suggests that four years into the U.S. recovery, slow household formation remains an obstacle to a more robust economy. It is damping demand in the housing market, where home sales have been rising but remain below historical levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Young adults "have not regained confidence in the economy enough to start moving out of their parents' homes," Mr. Kolko said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Multiple factors lie behind slow household formation. Unemployment remains high, and wages stagnant, particularly for young adults. Many of them lack the down-payments and credit histories needed to qualify for mortgages. High rents, due to rising demand and tight inventory, also are likely limiting household formation. Also, Americans are waiting longer than previous generations to start families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kolko performed the analysis at the Journal's request to measure one aspect of pent-up housing demand. His analysis shows that the number of missing households was 2.4 million as of March, up 100,000 from a year earlier. That is below the peak of 2.6 million in 2011, but far higher than the 900,000 in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say household formation is closely linked to home construction: If the 2.4 million "missing households" took the leap and entered the housing market -- either as renters or buyers -- overall housing demand would increase, leading to a pickup in construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than half of the missing households represent Americans ages 18 to 34 years, Mr. Kolko estimated. The rest are split roughly evenly between those ages 35 to 54, and those 55 and above.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His analysis shows that among Americans ages 18 to 34, nearly a third, or 31.3%, lived with parents as of March. That was down from the previous year's share of 31.6% but still far above the 27.4% average from 2000 to 2007. The data show that even young Americans with jobs are still more likely to live with parents than they were before the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some "missing households" aren't eager to get their own place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brianna Pade, a 25-year-old who works in public relations for a software company, says she earns a high enough salary to live on her own but opts to live with her parents in Castle Pines, Colo., outside of Denver. She said the money she otherwise would be using for rent enables her to travel frequently -- she just booked a trip to Iceland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It seems this way among my immediate friends," Ms. Pade said. "We enjoy experiences, so if we have to pick and choose and sacrifice certain things, we'd sacrifice living on our own."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto and Eliot Brown </div><div>1182 words</div><div>23 July 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A19</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bill passed in Albany last month provides a path for bringing potentially tens of millions of dollars in private money to Hudson River Park, the strip of well-used green space on Manhattan's western shore that has been scrambling to find long-term funding for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the legislation -- which allows the park to sell air rights to nearby property owners -- has come under fire from many advocates long involved with the park who criticize it as an 11th-hour bargain that benefits developers more than the park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A particular sore point: Mike Novogratz, the chairman of Friends of Hudson River Park, a fundraising and advocacy arm that pushed for the legislation, could benefit financially from the new rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Novogratz is a principal at <span class="companylink">Fortress Investment Group</span>, which oversees funds that own a controlling stake in the former St. John's Terminal Building, a three-block site less than a block from the park that potentially would be one of the largest beneficiaries of the air rights. He said he wasn't aware of the legislation's air-rights provision and he wasn't personally involved in the December 2012 purchase of the building, a former freight-rail terminal that developers view as among the most desirable sites on the West Side to build luxury apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers in New York are only allowed by zoning to build a designated amount of square footage on a given site, but they can build larger by acquiring additional air rights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to Mr. Novogratz, Joseph Rose is a member of the 13-person board of directors of the Hudson River Park Trust, the nonprofit group that oversees the park, and is a partner at a company that owns a site on 30th Street that could theoretically benefit from any air-rights transfer. A spokesman for Mr. Rose's Georgetown Co. said the firm "will not seek additional development rights from the Hudson River Park."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, park advocates said that both roles created an appearance of conflict. "I find it questionable that two principals are direct beneficiaries," said Tom Fox, who helped oversee the park's creation and later served as a Friends board member. "It just doesn't pass the smell test."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Civic groups said they had become concerned about such apparent conflicts with private developers who served on nonprofit boards, as the city increasingly looks to sell development rights and library and school buildings to generate more money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you have an influential developer on a board whose property adjoins the park then that raises red flags instantly," said Susan Lerner, executive director of Common Cause, an advocate for transparency in government. "This isn't to say that there aren't some developers who are able to work in the public interest, but this is an area where there needs to be a watchful eye."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Novogratz conceded that on its face his dual roles might seem problematic. "It certainly doesn't look great," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he said his involvement on both fronts had been minimal and that the St. John's site was overseen by a separate division of <span class="companylink">Fortress Investment Group</span>. Friends of Hudson River Park hired a lobbyist to push for the legislation, but Mr. Novogratz said he wasn't involved in negotiations. Steve Orr, the Friends' managing director, said they were primarily a fundraising arm and didn't take part in crafting the legislation. He directed questions to the trust, which is the administrative body.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Novogratz said he long had supported allowing the park to sell air rights because it would help generate revenue without having to put new development on Pier 40, which is within the park boundaries. "I don't think we should have hotels on the pier. I don't think we should have residents on the pier. I don't think we should have parking on the pier. In my utopia it's all fields and other activities," Mr. Novogratz said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Novogratz said he would likely give away benefits he ultimately reaped from development at the St. John's site to the park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the city and state created Hudson River Park in 1998, they envisioned it would pay for maintenance from development and other fees. But that has proved difficult. Attempts to bring an income-creating development on Pier 40 within the park have been beaten back by neighbors and the local assemblywoman, Deborah Glick. The Trust this year is running a more than $7 million deficit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the legislation, which backers said they expected Gov. Andrew Cuomo to sign, the park could sell air rights up to one block east of its boundaries. A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo's office didn't respond to a request for comment. Any such sale would still need to win approval from the City Planning Commission and City Council.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bill "does a lot of very important things for both the financial stability of the park and the quality of the park," said Assemblyman Richard Gottfried, who represents part of New York City, its main sponsor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a number of park advocates and community leaders said the plan took them by surprise. They expressed concerns the plan wouldn't be a long-term source of funding and about promoting additional development on the West Side, which has already seen a construction boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In this case, there's a lot of money to be had. There's [development] deals that are going to be made and people who live on that park in particular are going to be affected by what happens up in Albany," said Laura Haight, a senior environmental associate with the <span class="companylink">New York Public Interest Research Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bill was introduced on June 17 -- the Monday in the legislative session's final week -- and passed the Senate in the early hours on Saturday, June 22. Legislators and others involved said they couldn't recall when the air-rights transfer was initially added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The trust presented new language almost every day. There were new versions almost every day, which of course made it impossible to get back to the community and have conversations with people," said Ms. Glick, who supported the bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Madelyn Wils, president of the Hudson River Park Trust, said the group had been discussing the air-rights transfer for well over a year at community boards and a task force on the future of the park. "For the few sites left that have not been rezoned this would give the park an opportunity to benefit from any future rezoning." she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other community groups have said the bill would allow the park to cope with its funding shortfall without putting development in the park."It takes development pressure away from the park and that's clearly been controversial and problematic," said Tobi Bergman, of Pier Champions, which advocates for ball fields on the pier.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Craig Karmin </div><div>772 words</div><div>23 July 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Individual investors increasingly are turning to real estate in search of higher returns, and few in the industry have capitalized on this trend more than Nicholas Schorsch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 52-year old chief executive's American Realty Capital has emerged as the dominant money-raiser in the rapidly rising nontraded real-estate-investment-trust industry. These property funds are marketed as shares by brokers to financial advisers, rather than traded on an exchange as public REITs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New York-based firm's nine unlisted REITs took in $3.6 billion during the first six months of the year -- nearly half the total funds raised by the industry, according to Robert A. Stanger &amp; Co., an investment bank that tracks nontraded REITs. Last year, Mr. Schorsch's nontraded REITs raised $2.6 billion, also tops in the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American Realty Capital's biggest REITs own about 2,800 properties and have produced double-digit returns since 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the company's rapid expansion also is raising questions about how effectively Mr. Schorsch can invest such large piles of cash, and whether his recent decision to acquire more properties with lower credit-quality tenants could hurt him during an economic downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm somewhat suspicious of these guys," said David Bax, a financial planner in Las Vegas who has steered clients away from American Realty Capital. "When they are bringing in that much money over a short period, I wonder how careful they are investing it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schorsch said such concerns are misplaced. He said his firm has 100 people on staff working on due diligence, acquiring and operating property. "We have never had a single default," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American Realty Capital's early success -- and the questions some are raising about future returns when the property market cools down -- is a reminder that the nontraded REIT business is still going through growing pains even as it attracts billions of dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The industry is on pace to raise a record $17 billion in 2013, and about $94 billion since it started to attract capital in 2000, according to Stanger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, in recent years, nontraded REITs have come under increased regulatory scrutiny, with the <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span> and others probing whether brokers and some REITs themselves have misled investors about the risks, the high fees and the illiquidity of these investments. Some REITs eliminated dividends or suspended redemptions during the downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schorsch said his firm hasn't been the subject of any regulatory probe and that his funds have taken steps to address fees and other issues. "I hope I bring encouragement to an industry that has been under siege," he said at recent REIT conference in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American Realty Capital funds have acquired about 2,600 retail spaces for pharmaceutical chains, fast-food franchises and other single-tenant buildings. The holdings range from a <span class="companylink">Dollar General</span> in Cedar Creek, Texas, to a <span class="companylink">Tractor Supply</span> store in Upper Freehold, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm's funds also buy large portfolios. American Realty Capital has spent $8.4 billion this year on mergers and acquisitions, including a portfolio of 986 retail properties from <span class="companylink">General Electric Co</span>.'s finance arm for $1.5 billion. Separately, an affiliate of American Realty Capital has agreed to purchase <span class="companylink">CapLease Inc</span>., a public REIT that owns single-tenant buildings, for $2.2 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scooping up properties fast has meant taking on more potential risk by adding tenants with lower credit quality. More than 70% of tenants in American Realty Capital's earlier nontraded REIT's had an investment-grade credit rating. But only 33% of the tenants in the $2.4 billion nontraded REIT known as ARC IV are investment-grade, according to an American Realty Capital analyst presentation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of these stores are made to fit the current tenant, so if a tenant goes out of business it may be more difficult to find a replacement, analysts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schorsch said the perceived risk is overstated. The reason his recent REIT has fewer investment-grade credits is because of the GE acquisition, which had lower-credit tenants. He said despite that, the portfolio performed well for GE during the downturn, growing overall revenue by 4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, he seemed to acknowledge the credit-quality issue by requiring that the new REIT be at least 50% investment grade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said there are 200,000 investors in the company's nontraded REITs. Three of American Realty Capital's unlisted REITs have posted gains between 22.5% and 33.6% since 2011, according to Stanger.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos </div><div>997 words</div><div>22 July 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing recovery that began unfolding early last year faces its first serious test: In the span of just two months, mortgage rates have jumped by a full percentage point, something that has happened only twice since 1994.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates, which at the beginning of May stood at 3.59% for the average 30-year fixed-rate loan, jumped to 4.68% during the first two weeks of July, the latest available data, according to the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>. That is the highest level in two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say that even at a 4.5% or 5% mortgage rate, housing is still affordable by historical standards -- and that rates could rise to 6% or prices could rise an additional 20% before housing would become unaffordable relative to historical levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spike nevertheless represents a big payment shock for would-be buyers. Many shop for a home based on their monthly mortgage payment. The monthly payment of principal and interest -- and not including taxes and insurance -- on a $200,000 home with a 10% down payment just went up by more than $100, to $925, while the monthly cost of a $450,000 home just went up by around $250, to $2,095.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That's extremely meaningful. It is putting people on the sidelines that were really at the margins of being able to qualify," said Ronald Peltier, chief executive of HomeServices of America Inc., which owns real-estate brokerages in 21 states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some agents say it's possible that rising rates will spur purchases by dawdling buyers who had already decided they were going to buy a home. But mortgage bankers say it's rare that higher rates actually generate net new demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates climbed in June amid a sudden rise in yields on Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities, as investors sold off bonds on concerns that the Federal Reserve would soon slow the bond-buying program that has helped push down mortgage rates since it launched last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing has been a bright spot over the past year for an economy that has seen otherwise weak growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke told Congress that if mortgage-rate increases threatened recent gains in the housing market, the Fed would have to take "additional action."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surge in rates could test buyers' appetites to pay above asking prices, potentially slowing the run-up in home prices witnessed in the first half of the year. The biggest pinch will be felt by potential homeowners in high-cost housing markets that had been stretching to qualify for the largest loan possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The frenzy has concluded," said Jim Klinge, a real-estate agent in Carlsbad, Calif. "The pool of crazy buyers -- those willing to pay higher prices because they're tired of losing bidding wars -- has diminished considerably."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In early May, when mortgage rates were hovering near record lows, real-estate agent Angela Creech quickly had six offers for a two-bedroom condominium she had listed in Irvine, Calif. It went under contract for $465,000 but the deal fell through and the condo went back on the market in June, after rates had gone up. It took two more weeks to receive an offer at the original asking price of $450,000. "Prices have definitely flattened out," Ms. Creech said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slower price growth in some of the nation's hottest housing markets, particularly in major California metro areas, should temper recent fears of new housing bubbles. On a national basis, houses no longer look undervalued relative to incomes, as they did two years ago. Housing is still affordable, "but it is no longer a bargain," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Does this mean the housing recovery is over? No, especially if rates rise because the economy is improving. "Prices will still go up, but it will be much more difficult to raise prices, which is a good thing because the momentum was heading for a bubble," said John Burns, chief executive of a home-builder consulting firm in Irvine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, industry executives say the biggest problem facing buyers is the shortage of homes available for sale. "I don't think rates are going to be an issue in the near term," said Richard Smith, chief executive of Realogy Corp., which owns the Coldwell Banker and Century 21 real-estate brands. "You're going to continue to see tight inventory. Pricing is going to continue to go up."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data tracked by housing analyst Ivy Zelman show that the ratio of homes for sale as a share of total U.S. households was at its lowest level in more than 27 years during the first quarter, at around 1.5%. Over that span, prices have increased whenever that ratio has fallen below the median of 2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are other reasons that suggest rising rates could matter more than they have in the past. Lenders have been slow to ease credit standards that tightened sharply five years ago. Many would-be buyers still carry high debt loads relative to incomes that aren't growing much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While mortgage rates on traditional loans are at a two-year high, the cost of mortgages backed by the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span>, which allow buyers to make down payments of just 3.5%, are even more expensive because the agency has boosted insurance fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investor purchases -- often made in cash -- could also cool as foreclosures ebb and deals wane. For the recovery to continue, mortgage-dependent first-time home buyers will need to step up, says Mr. Zandi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supply-demand imbalances still favor sellers, which means price gains should continue despite higher mortgage rates. But those gains would look better if they were supported by an economy that was adding more high-paying jobs. Until that happens, the housing sector faces a less predictable path.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Lauren Schuker Blum </div><div>2487 words</div><div>19 July 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years ago, when he was 26, Matt Winter paid a little over $1 million for a four-bedroom, Mediterranean-style house in Culver City, an artsy, formerly industrial section of Los Angeles. This month, the now 28-year-old Mr. Winter, who runs his own interior design firm, paid about $1.7 million for his second home, a three-bedroom, Spanish-revival in Westwood, a neighborhood near UCLA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I have always felt that having your money in property is the safest and best thing to do if you want to grow your personal wealth," says Mr. Winter, who founded his design company at 23. None of Mr. Winter's assets are in the stock market -- he says the market "spooks him" and that he prefers to invest in real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Winter is part of a growing group of wealthy young buyers who are making inroads in the world of high-end real estate, acquiring properties at prices, and at a pace, that brokers say they have never seen before. Real-estate agents say that young people are buying more expensive homes than previously. They are also more likely to buy several properties, and use one as an investment. Buying real estate has grown more attractive, these young buyers say, compared with the stock market, which appears riskier to a generation that entered the workforce during a market correction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, low interest rates coupled with lower real-estate prices had also made it easier for people in their 20s and early 30s -- whom demographers refer to as "Generation Y" or "millennials" -- to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In the last two months, half the folks I sold homes to were young entrepreneurial types -- and they were all buying homes for over a million dollars," says Michael Rankin, a managing partner at TTR Sotheby's International Realty in Washington, D.C. "A few years ago, that kind of buyer was invisible. We had young folks buying starter condos for a few hundred thousand dollars. But this new wave is skipping that step entirely and going right for the high-end home."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, Mr. Rankin helped broker a deal for Grant Allen, a 34-year-old who works in venture capital and paid $1.1 million for a 2,400-square-foot three-bedroom row house in D.C.'s Logan Circle neighborhood. His 28-year-old fiancee also owns a condo in the city, but in part because of Mr. Rankin's advice the couple decided to keep it as an investment and now rent it out for $3,250 a month. "The stock market has popped lately, but I view it generally with a lot of skepticism," says Mr. Allen, who adds that he has recently reduced his exposure to public equities to about two-thirds of his assets from three-quarters. "These days, I feel like you need to put your money in something that's more of a sure thing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While homeownership rates have fallen sharply in the past year among the middle-age, the rate has actually grown among young people aged 25 to 34, according to Census Bureau data. And while the average age of a first-time home buyer has remained relatively constant -- at 31 -- over the past decade, brokers and analysts alike say that the wealthiest 10% of millennials will have a profound effect on the future real-estate market. The spending of this 10% will account for one fifth of all dollars spent on primary-home purchases over the next three years, according to the 2013 Survey of Affluence and Wealth in America, which is conducted annually by American Express Publishing and the Harrison Group, a market research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And according to a new report issued by the National Association of Realtors, millennials now compose the second-largest group of recent home buyers, making up 28% of the pool. ("Generation X," the age group just slightly older, ranks first.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My generation -- we got burned pretty bad by the stock market, we're tired of paying rent, and we don't see any better place to put our money," explains Oren Alexander, a 26-year-old real-estate broker who caters to many young, wealthy buyers. He had about 25% of his assets in the stock market but liquidated them in 2012 to invest in real estate instead. He is in contract to buy his first apartment for $1.5 million, a 1,000-square-foot two-bedroom on the Bowery in downtown Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some investment professionals caution against the strategy. Andrew O'Daniel, a senior vice president and financial advisor at <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>, says home buyers of any age shouldn't look at their primary residence as an investment but rather as a useful necessity, because equities and other assets tend to offer better returns. "If they can make a little money off their home, because of where we are in the real-estate cycle, so be it. That's a nice fringe benefit," he says. "But it shouldn't be the number one objective."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another factor in the surge: the tech boom. Brokers say many of the young buyers today have made money during the IPOs of technology companies such as <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, <span class="companylink">Google</span>, LinkedIn, or they have profited by starting their own companies. Ken DeLeon, a broker in the San Francisco Bay area, says that he has seen a large shift in recent years among high-end home buyers, with 70% more people under 35 in the mix today than just two years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of that comes as young tech titans, rich in stock, attempt to diversify their portfolios. "We felt that real estate was a much more stable asset class than equities. It also offers tax advantages, which a lot of our friends in tech are looking for these days," says former <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> executive Rick Armbrust. Now 33, Mr. Armbrust and his wife, Sheila, a litigator, paid $1.2 million for a newly built 2,000-square-foot duplex condominium in Noe Valley about 2 1/2 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These young techies are often making big real-estate leaps too, jumping from a modest monthly rental to a large home in a single step, rather than purchasing the starter home that was a home-buying hallmark of other generations. "One of my <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> clients recently moved from an 800-square-foot rental apartment to a 9,000-square-foot home, which they purchased for $7 million," Mr. DeLeon recalls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many young buyers are also selecting the most expensive markets in the country, brokers say, skipping modest neighborhoods in favor of the exclusive. Fernanda Vidigal, 33, recently paid $2.2 million for a 2,530-square-foot condominium on Fisher Island, a members-only community in Miami. Ms. Vidigal, who works in finance and lives most of the year in Sao Paulo plans to spend an additional $1 million to renovate the unit, which has floor-to-ceiling windows that overlook the ocean. "The apartment was cheap for what it is," says Ms. Vidigal. "We got a good value -- and moreover, it will be really easy to rent this place once it is renovated."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the very high end, some of the most headline-grabbing purchases of the past few years have been made by wealthy young buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, a trust acting on behalf of young Russian heiress Ekaterina Rybolovleva paid $88 million for a penthouse on Central Park West -- the largest residential transaction on record in Manhattan. Earlier this year, she picked up two Greek islands. The Ecclestone sisters, 20-something daughters of Formula One racing boss Bernie Ecclestone, have spent more than $150 million on properties in London and Beverly Hills over the past few years -- and brokers say they may buy more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This lavish spending at the high end is in part due to a consolidation of wealth among the global elite, says Jeff Hyland, a top luxury broker in Los Angeles whose firm Hilton &amp; Hyland brokered a deal for the Ecclestone family. "There is so much more wealth today among the superrich," says Mr. Hyland. "More than ever these families need a way to safely and quickly distribute money to their children and to different countries. Real estate is a great answer."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Familial assistance, even at more modest levels, has also boosted the purchasing power of younger buyers, brokers say. Parents are helping their children make purchases more often than ever, these people add, in part because keeping their retirement funds in bonds or money-market accounts yields lower returns than in previous decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've seen more parents buy homes for their children in the last year than in my whole career," says Jade Mills, a luxury broker in Los Angeles. "It was very unusual 10 years ago. In the last year, I've sold six houses to clients whose parents paid for them."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Olivia Waldman, a physician assistant in surgery, approached her parents a few years ago about her desire to buy an apartment in Manhattan. To her surprise, they suggested they contribute to the purchase so they could buy a larger place that might be a better investment. They ended up buying a two-bedroom condo on the Upper East Side for $1.15 million in cash. Ms. Waldman, now 33, didn't contribute to the purchase but pays the monthly maintenance fee. "The apartment is much bigger than I personally would have wanted for myself, but it makes a lot of financial sense because it will resell better than a small studio would," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of those parents are baby boomers, who are near retirement age and are also passing along more money to their children than prior generations, according to the study of the wealthiest 10% of Americans conducted by American Express Publishing and the Harrison Group. The study shows that while 24% of millennials have grown up wealthy, only 7% of baby boomers and 9% of Gen X Americans report growing up rich.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For the first time since the pre-Depression, Gatsby era, we have a generation of kids whose parents made a great deal of money and are giving a great deal of it to their children," says Jim Taylor, vice chairman of the Harrison Group and an author of the study. "Prior to this, very few families had money through inheritance. There is a living wealth transfer currently taking place that this country hasn't seen in decades."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate developers say they too have noticed the influx of millennials and are now catering to their preferences. These buyers tend to like new construction, with modern touches such as floor-to-ceiling windows, high ceilings and rooms that flow from indoors to outdoors. They also gravitate toward open floor plans that provide large, fluid spaces for entertaining, rather than separate living and dining rooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These days, we absolutely design with a younger buyer in mind," says Lance Tate, a Los Gatos, Calif.-based developer who builds spec homes. "We try to limit walls as much as we can to create an open floor plan and we avoid any ornate nonsense. We try to build modern and we also put solar on a lot of our homes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amenities are another draw, and many luxury buildings have had success luring millennials with the promise of pools, gyms, spas, and basketball courts. 515 East 72nd Street, a 41-story building in Manhattan, has all those features and 326 units that range from $725,000 to more than $12 million. In the last six weeks, managing director for Corcoran Sunshine Elaine Diratz, who oversees sales for the building, says she has sold about seven one-bedroom units to young buyers whose parents have assisted them with the purchase; only six one-bedrooms out of the building's 147 one-bedroom units remain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kimberly Lucero, who runs sales for the <span class="companylink">Ritz-Carlton</span> Residences at LA Live in downtown Los Angeles, says she was surprised by the number of young people interested in units at the building. "You think of the Ritz as a more traditional place for the older, affluent crowd." But today almost 15% of the building's residents are millennials, she says. "Our condos have been graduation presents for USC graduates more than once, or gifts to celebrate a kid's first job."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To attract more young people, Ms. Lucero says she and her sales team upgraded the building's amenities in January, renovating the common areas where she noticed young residents like to entertain their friends. Now, in place of several generic lounges, the building features a sports-watching room with multiple televisions, a wine-tasting room, an entertainment library, a travel library and a daily breakfast buffet, served in a special lounge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers are also marketing to millennials by advertising through new channels. At 250 Bowery in Manhattan, the marketing team turned to social media to promote the building, running renderings of units through filters on Instagram, the photo-sharing site. The 24-unit luxury development sold out within a month when it hit the market late last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The fact that the building was all over Instagram, that definitely made me feel like it was new and chic," says Joseph Hanono, a 29-year-old who runs his own insurance company and is in contract to purchase a 600-square-foot unit in the building for close to $1 million. "I feel like my neighbors there are going to be the kind of people I want to be neighbors with," he adds, "people who make me feel confident that I am building real equity with this apartment, rather than owning some random stock."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Power Buyers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the most headline-grabbing purchases of recent years have been by wealthy buyers in their 20s and early 30s. Here are some of the notable young shoppers building big real-estate portfolios.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of new homes fell sharply in June, highlighting risks to the sector's recovery from rising mortgage rates and supply constraints.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts declined 9.9% in June from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 836,000 units, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. Building permits, a key gauge of future construction activity, fell by 7.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The readings were much worse than expected, with most economists forecasting modest gains in both categories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the decline in housing starts was primarily driven by a 26% drop in multifamily housing, a category that traditionally has been volatile and has lately shown signs of overbuilding. Starts for single-family homes, which account for the largest share of activity, fell by 0.8%. Single-family permits rose 0.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The outlook for housing is still bright," said <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics economist Celia Chen. She said the June housing report "is more of a hiccup."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing sector has been strengthening in recent months as low prices and steady employment gains have fueled demand. But housing construction had remained somewhat constrained. Many builders are wary of ramping up activity too quickly and say they are being held back by atrophied supply networks and high prices of materials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, rising mortgage rates represent a relatively new threat to the sector. The <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span> on Wednesday said mortgage-loan applications were down 2.6% from last week while refinancing fell 4% to the lowest level since July 2011.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jim Carlton </div><div>1048 words</div><div>17 July 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO -- When Alexandra Goldman got notice of her rent increase -- from $6,000 a month on a five-bedroom house she shared with roommates to $11,000 -- she says she was in disbelief.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We knew immediately we were not going to be able to pay that much money to live there," said Ms. Goldman, a 28-year-old planning consultant whose share of the rent was about $1,000 a month. After receiving the notice in October, she said the house's occupants ended up dispersing to other rentals. She is living with other roommates now and paying about $300 more than she had before. Her former landlord didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Welcome to what is arguably one of the worst cities in America to be a renter, but among the best to be a landlord and apartment investor. San Francisco led the top-50 U.S. metropolitan areas in average rent growth during the second quarter, jumping 7.8% to $2,498, while Oakland was No. 2 at a 6.9% increase, and San Jose was in fifth place at 5%. The 6.8% increase for the combined San Francisco Bay area was more than double the nation's 3.1% increase, according to preliminary estimates by MPF Research, a market-research firm in Carrollton, Texas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rent increases have investors rushing to purchase existing properties. San Francisco-based Ridge Capital Investors, for example, has acquired nearly 500 units throughout the area since 2011, including a 45-unit apartment complex in San Mateo, a city south of San Francisco, for $10.95 million in November. Trevor Wilson, managing director of Ridge Capital, said his company has competed against as many as 30 bidders on multifamily properties in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've been trying to find more [properties], but there's not a lot available," said Mr. Wilson, who added his firm is spending about $1.5 million to refurbish units at the 34-year-old Mariner's West Apartments in San Mateo so rents now well below market levels can be raised. Tenants there are paying as much as $1,000 below the market rate of $2,300 to $2,400 a month for that area, Mr. Wilson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fueling the rental increases in San Francisco and many other cities across the country are a resurgence in two key industries -- technology and energy -- and a generally improving economy nationwide, said Ryan Severino, senior economist at <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>., a market-research firm in New York. Rents in energy-rich Denver jumped 6.1% from a year ago, according to MPF Research, while Seattle, another tech hub, saw rents increase 6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Severino said rents are rising the fastest in cities with the tightest supply of housing, like the Bay Area and Seattle. San Francisco's vacancy rate for multifamily housing in the second quarter stood at 3%, the same as a year earlier, compared with a national average of 4.7%, according to MPF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some cities with less-robust job markets enjoyed a strengthened market but remained at higher vacancy rates amid deeper housing inventories. Philadelphia's vacancy rate dropped to 5.4% in the second quarter, from 6.1% a year earlier and compared with a national average of 4.7%. The rate in Las Vegas fell to 7.5% from 8.4%, and in Memphis, Tenn., to 8.9% from 10.1%, according to MPF Research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the nation's tightest apartment markets, some observers worry the local labor pool may eventually go down, because of people being driven away. In Ms. Goldman's case, she said she and her roommates mostly had the means to remain in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regarded by industry analysts as chronically underhoused, San Francisco added 31,000 jobs in 2012 in a city of about 800,000. That is resulting in sticker shock for new arrivals. Leena Rao, with her husband, Suneel Gupta, recently leased a two-bedroom, two-bath home for between $4,000 and $5,000 a month, compared with $2,150 for the two-bedroom they left behind in Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was a brutal surprise," said Ms. Rao, 31, an editor for a technology news website.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tight supplies have unleashed a torrent of new construction in the Bay Area, with 14,377 units permitted for construction over the next 18 months, according to MPF Research. In San Francisco, the 22-story 1190 Mission at Trinity Place building preleased half its 419 units before opening July 1, with tenants signing agreements without having toured a model or attended an apartment tour, said Rob Willis, director of operations for Trinity Management Services, the builder. "We have never seen this," Mr. Willis said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some homeowners are seeking to cash in on the demand. Jane Shepard said she and her husband, Avrum, plan to rent their four-bedroom home in San Francisco to help raise money for needed repairs. "Financially, it's a great time to be a landlord," said Ms. Shepard, 67, a commercial-property manager. She said the couple would move to their second home in Visalia, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But renters with less means are finding fewer options. Dawn Griffin, 55, said she was served with an eviction notice in January on her $725-a-month apartment near the city's Golden Gate Park. Landlord Elba Borgen, who didn't return calls for comment, also served eviction notices on the other seven tenants in the building, said Ted Gullicksen, executive director of the San Francisco Tenants Union, which has offered advice and other help to Ms. Griffin and other tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I can't afford to move," said Ms. Griffin, a 30-year resident of the apartment and a medical-office administrator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some tenants have turned the situation into opportunity. Sam Parr said he ended up starting a business matching roommates with apartments after moving to San Francisco from Nashville, Tenn., last year and seeing prices so high. "I thought, oh my God, this is awful -- something has to be done," said Mr. Parr, 24, who sold the business to a larger startup and now shares a $3,500-a-month house with three roommates.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Developers Reach for the Sky Once Again --- From New York City to Shenzhen, China, Builders Compete With Renewed Enthusiasm to be Among the Tallest of the Tall</span>
</div><div class="author">By Peter Evans </div><div>824 words</div><div>17 July 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The newest skyscraper rising in London, the 48-story Leadenhall Building, will be the second-tallest office building in the city's financial district when completed next year. The tower's size as well as the tapered-glass design -- which some say resembles a box-style cheese grater -- have drawn praise throughout Britain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, by some international standards, the Leadenhall, which is a joint venture between developers <span class="companylink">British Land Co</span>. and Canada's Oxford Properties, could be considered run-of-the-mill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the world, the business of building skyscrapers is making a big comeback as the global economy slowly recovers and the pain of the financial crisis continues to fade. Supported by innovations in design and engineering and driven by the desire of town planners and developers to make bold architectural statements, these tall towers are springing up at the fastest rate since the financial crisis -- and reaching new heights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly 600 buildings of at least 200 meters (656 feet) in height, or about 60 stories high, are either under construction or in the planning stages world-wide, according to the <span class="companylink">Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat</span>. The growth spurt will nearly double the number of buildings 200 meters or taller over the next 10 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means a mere 735-foot tower like the Leadenhall, which is roughly half the size of the Empire State Building in New York, is "becoming the norm now," said Ian Milne, senior design director in Hong Kong for design and engineering consultants <span class="companylink">WS Atkins</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finland's <span class="companylink">Kone Oyj</span>, which makes escalators and elevators for many of the world's tallest buildings, recently exhibited technology allowing elevators to ascend upward of 300 stories. "At the moment, it looks like the trend will be for taller and taller buildings," said Matti Alahuhta, Kone's president and chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Innovations like Kone's are both feeding and facilitating the desire for taller skyscrapers. Currently, there are only three buildings in the world measuring more than 500 meters (1,640 feet), but there are plans for 20 more by 2020, including the Kingdom Tower in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, which will be the world's first 1,000-meter tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three of the four tallest buildings completed in 2012 were in Dubai, including the 1,355-foot Princess Tower, the world's tallest residential building, developed by <span class="companylink">Tameer Holding</span>. Dubai also is home to the world's tallest tower, the 2,717-foot Burj Khalifa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although many skyscraper projects signed off on in the boom years were completed during the downturn, starts of new towers virtually ground to a halt in Dubai -- and in many other parts of the world -- between the end of 2008 and the end of 2012. Since the beginning of this year, however, designers and engineers say they have seen a resurgence in interest in skyscrapers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Damac Holding Co</span>., the Middle East's largest private developer of luxury property by amount of space developed, typifies the return of ambition to Dubai's property market. The developer's flagship project, the 1,099-foot Damac Residenze, a residential tower overlooking Dubai Marina, is slated to be completed in 2016 and boasts interior design by Italian fashion house Fendi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hussain Sajwani, Damac's chairman, says the appetite for colossal "top luxury" towers has returned. But, unlike during the building boom 10 years ago, when some developers showed little restraint in taking on ambitious projects, this time there is a less-frenetic approach and efforts to ensure buildings are commercially viable. "The market has matured, and the customer is more educated," Mr. Sajwani said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But critics argue the rush to build megatowers in Dubai and other cities around the Middle East, such as Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and Doha, Qatar, is causing a bubble, increasing the likelihood of another property crash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Some of this is down to ego," said Philip Oldfield, a lecturer in architecture at the <span class="companylink">University of Nottingham</span> and a specialist in sustainable tall buildings. "One new development is that tall buildings are being used to show how developed a city or a country is . . . [and] not purely to fulfill a need for space."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with the Middle East, China is about to see an explosion of megatowers. The four tallest buildings under construction are in China, according to the tall-buildings council, including the 2,165-foot Ping An Finance Center in Shenzhen. Experts say skyscrapers in Asia are often a response to overcrowded cities, where the only way to build is up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York also is falling back in love with the skyscraper and is home to two of the top-20 tallest buildings under construction, notably the 1,776-foot One World Trade Center.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Robbie Whelan and Dawn Wotapka </div><div>1136 words</div><div>16 July 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation's biggest publicly traded home builders are on a buying spree, snapping up small privately held companies who made it through the housing slump but now are struggling to find financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big builders are seeing their profits healthy and their homes selling at higher prices. For their smaller, privately owned competitors, times remain tough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What sets the big builders apart is access to capital. The bond market has been kind to big builders, which issued a record $8.1 billion in bonds last year. Bond issues are on pace to have one of the strongest years ever this year, according to a recent analysis by <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private builders have traditionally relied on small or regional banks for funding. But many of those lenders stopped making loans for construction and development during the financial crisis and have been slow to resume. More than 480 banks have failed since the beginning of the downturn, according to the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And lenders haven't been eager to make new loans to the industry: According to the FDIC, the dollar value of outstanding construction and development loans has declined 68% since the peak of the market in early 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without bank credit, small builders are unable to buy and develop the land necessary to build homes. That has allowed the biggest builders to rapidly gain market share, in large part by acquiring their smaller competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's getting tougher and tougher for the little guy," said Michael P. Kahn, a building-industry consultant based in Palm Coast, Fla. "The big builders are coming in with big purses and saying, 'Sell me what you've got, I'll write you a check for it.'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kahn, who has advised builders on 96 mergers and acquisitions since 1987, retired from real-estate deal-making in January 2011, but came out of retirement late last year. He has since advised on three deals, and predicts there will be as many as 20 more over the next two years. "The floodgates have opened," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past 18 months, public builders have completed at least eight large acquisitions totaling an estimated $1.5 billion, according to Mr. Kahn, the biggest round of consolidation the industry has seen since 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The largest 10 publicly traded builders, which sold 24% of the nation's new homes in 2007, sold 30% of all new homes during the first quarter of 2013, according to a <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> analysis. Sales of newly built homes were running at an annual pace of nearly 480,000 in May, according to the Commerce Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have two ways to win right now: We participate in the natural recovery, but additionally, we're picking up market share from a group of builders that isn't able to get financing," said Stuart Miller, chief executive of Miami-based <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>., the country's third-largest builder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the downturn, <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> has gained market position in 14 of the 30 markets in which it builds, according to the company. The gains helped drive home-building revenue up 59% to $1.28 billion in its second quarter from the prior year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, many small builders are fighting to survive. Craig Perry, who built luxury homes for 20 years in Florida, hosted a party last year in Orlando, Fla., at the industry's biggest convention to show off 2012's "Concept Home," with a poolside dining room and an outdoor cabana guest room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, Mr. Perry sold his company, along with land enough to build 3,200 houses, to <span class="companylink">Standard Pacific Corp</span>., a publicly traded builder based in Irvine, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our capital is a lot more expensive than the public builders. There is a sense of, 'If you can't beat them, join them,'" said Mr. Perry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even some small builders who were able to secure bank loans have decided to sell out rather than continue to compete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eric Campbell founded CamWest Development in Seattle in 1990, when he was 25. At the height of the market in the mid-2000s, his company was selling 250 luxury homes per year and bringing in revenue of $160 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But starting in 2008, Mr. Campbell said, his lenders began asking him to contribute more cash to each subdivision he was building, eventually as much as half the cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For about six months in 2008, he said, he became sleep-deprived from worrying about how to refinance multiple short-term loans he had personally guaranteed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2011, he said, when he tried to buy a piece of land big enough for 81 homes with views of a lake near Bellevue, Wash., his lender asked CamWest to invest $10 million in cash before it would make a loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, Mr. Campbell sold his company to publicly traded <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers Inc</span>., the nation's largest builder of luxury homes. Now a Toll division president, he bought the land in Bellevue and started selling homes there, priced from $1.1 million to $1.7 million, late last year. He said he has hired 25 new employees for his new Toll division, and the sleepless nights are a thing of the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The lending environment for private home builders just doesn't match the business model," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other big builders have also been shopping. In May, <span class="companylink">Ryland Group Inc</span>. said it was buying Texas-based LionsGate Homes, its third acquisition in a year. <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">NVR Inc</span>. also acquired smaller players in the last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small builders, many of which turned to private-equity funds for financing during the downturn, are rushing to convert into public companies. Three new builders have gone public since January, and more are expected. The public market gives builders easier access to capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales fell 76% between their peak of 1.28 million in 2005 and low of 306,000 in 2011, the worst year on record. Hundreds of small builders failed, but not one of the 10 largest public home builders failed during the downturn that took hold in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Large public builders survived by writing down a combined $38.9 billion in value from their land portfolios -- a flexibility many private builders didn't have -- and pushing the government to refund some taxes paid during the boom years to offset losses during the housing crash. That policy, signed into law in 2008, gained the large public builders a combined $7.9 billion, according to Zelman &amp; Associates, a research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That was a lifesaver for these publics," said Robert Curran, <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>' lead home building analyst. "In the absence of these refunds, another four or five might have gone belly up."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brooklyn's population overtook that of Manhattan around 1930. But its skyline never has approached the magnitude of its sister borough, nor ever will if current design trends continue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lately, in a boom of trendiness and economic vitality, Brooklyn has been growing skyward again. The results still don't, unfortunately, present any sort of visual competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The north end of downtown Brooklyn is burgeoning. Clarett Group's 51-story rental building, the Brooklyner, at 111 Lawrence St. in Downtown Brooklyn, usurped the title of tallest in the borough from the Williamsburgh Savings Bank Building in 2009. Soon, the Brooklyner will be overtaken by Avalon Bay's 53-story 388 Bridge Street, a condo-rental hybrid set to open in 2014. And that tower will subsequently lose the title to another Avalon Bay rental project around the corner, the Avalon Willoughby West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less soaring but similarly notable on the skyline is Dermot Co.'s 44-story 66 Rockwell Place, sprouting up as a close neighbor to the Williamsburgh bank building, directly across the street from BAM's Harvey Theater. And that isn't even to mention Two Trees Management Co.'s just-approved 32-story BAM South tower just down the street. Both are rental buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't forget (and you won't if you ever take the Manhattan Bridge) the corridor of residential towers that has sprung up along Flatbush Avenue Extension in the past five years, with names sounding for all the world like new Honda brands -- the 38-story Toren, the 40-story Oro and the comparatively diminutive Gold, at 13 stories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brooklyn hasn't seen such a boom since the 1920s, when in the space of about 10 years four buildings juggled the claim of Brooklyn's tallest before yielding to the Williamsburgh bank building in 1929.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new development is great news for the street life of the borough's downtown, injecting thousands of new residents. But do any of the new buildings do justice in an aesthetic sense to a city whose skyscrapers have been inspiring the world for more than a century?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer is generally no. Those four Brooklyn towers that were built before the Great Depression now all have landmark status. While the tastes of the future are impossible to judge, it is pretty safe to predict such distinction will elude the more recent additions to the skyline. They are, in short, places from which to watch Manhattan, not things to be seen themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is taxing even to describe most of these buildings. From its renderings, 66 Rockwell Place looks like a dull slab to which a series of balconies don't so much add variety as incoherence. Nothing about the half-built appearance of the tower suggests there is much hope for a midcourse correction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Brooklyner offers a dream residence to those who wish to live in the world's tallest Fourth of July wafer cookie. The Oro is an ungainly marriage of glass and brick that, from a distance, looks not unlike lacquered cardboard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The turbocharged Toren at least tried for something distinctive with its rippling facade, a spot of monochrome Madras amid the drab fashions of Flatbush Avenue. Enrique Norten's slim BAM South tower offers some hope of distinction from early renderings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The general outlook, however, isn't great. James Davidson, a partner with SLCE Architects, the designers of 388 Bridge, noted that the building was "designed with a faceted floor plan providing numerous corners to take advantage of paramount views of the Manhattan and Brooklyn skylines." The building unquestionably does that, but unfortunately doesn't offer much ornament to the neighborhood itself. It isn't just civic narcissism to hope that a borough could look at itself admiringly sometimes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The greatest misfortune, in lower-slung Brooklyn, is that almost all of these new skyscrapers appear outsized in view from most angles. As Francoise Bollock, an adjunct associate professor at <span class="companylink">Columbia University</span>, observed: "If you build a mediocre skyscraper in lower Manhattan it is going to get absorbed in the crowd; it is just going to be one of the guys. Here, the pressure to better design increases."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Things were once different. That last skyscraper boom, inaugurated in 1918 with the Colonial Revival 32 Court Street, showed a sense of responsibility among developers and architects who claimed a piece of the skyline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those masterpieces included the 1926 Neo-Romanesque Court and Remsen Building, designed by Schwartz &amp; Gross, the same firm that designed the "Ghostbusters" Building on Central Park West and the Majestic Building in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 75 Livingston St., the tower that formerly housed the <span class="companylink">Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce</span> is perhaps Brooklyn's greatest skyscraper (if never one of its tallest), a brick-and limestone neo-gothic ziggurat overlooking Cadman Plaza. And the character of the Williamsburgh bank building needs no explication here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These buildings were born in a different age, after Brooklyn had ceded its independence but still had aspirations of grandeur. Today aspirations are back as Brooklyn increasingly competes with Manhattan for cool restaurants, pricey real estate and dominant sports teams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But something has been lost. For all of Brooklyn's hip reputation, you wouldn't know it from the skyline. If it is really hoping to make a visual impression as large as its cultural one, the borough had better keep building.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When CCA Civil Inc. won a bid this spring to rebuild a section of the Pulaski Skyway in New Jersey, the runner-up in the contest saw a chance to snatch away the huge road-building job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CCA Civil is a division of China Construction America Inc., the U.S. arm of <span class="companylink">China State Construction Engineering Corp</span>., one of the largest Chinese building companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the government of China has an ownership interest in the parent company, and in companies that have done energy-sector work in Iran, the rival contractor charges, CCA Civil should be barred from receiving government contracts in New Jersey under a new divestment law aimed at isolating the Middle Eastern nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rival contractor, <span class="companylink">Conti Enterprises Inc</span>., unsuccessfully petitioned the <span class="companylink">New Jersey Department of Transportation</span> to choose not to award the contract, and has filed to block it in state appellate court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In filings to the DOT and legal briefs, CCA Civil denied claims that it is directly owned or controlled by China, that it has corporate links to companies working in Iran and that it is subject to new laws that ban certain companies from receiving government contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">State authorities have agreed. Earlier this month, they awarded a $123 million contract to CCA for redecking the three-mile-long bridge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upshot of Conti's complaint, lawyers for CCA write, is "that each and every business that is directly or indirectly owned by the Chinese government is barred from government contracting." They argue the result would violate the U.S. Constitution's foreign-commerce clause, which bars states from legislating in foreign affairs unless authorized to do so by Congress, and work in opposition to federal and state efforts to bolster economic and cultural ties between the U.S. and China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"CCA Civil is committed to performing the work, and it has and will comply with all contract terms," said Michael Guiffre, an attorney for the company. He referred all other inquiries to the DOT.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CCA Civil is a growing presence in major public projects throughout the New York region. The company, based in New Jersey, is part of a joint venture rebuilding the Alexander Hamilton Bridge between Manhattan and the Bronx, and is one of the bidders vying to rebuild the Central Terminal Building at La Guardia Airport. The company has worked on New York City's No. 7 subway line extension, and constructed platforms for the train station at the new Yankee Stadium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dispute demonstrates the thorny legal questions that can arise as state governments begin to implement laws empowering them to enforce their own penalties on Iran. Whatever its outcome, the clash between Conti and CCA could be a sign of things to come, as corporations with foreign ties compete for U.S. business, experts said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rise in legal challenges is a "definite possibility" as more states begin to pass laws codifying lists of companies that are barred from receiving government contracts because of economic ties to Iran, said Lori Damrosch, a professor of international law at <span class="companylink">Columbia University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Jersey and New York are among the states that have passed such laws. The legislation came after a 2010 federal law that expanded sanctions on Iran, and encouraged states to develop their own procedures for freezing out firms that have engaged in prohibited activities in Iran, Ms. Damrosch said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under New Jersey's law, the state Department of the Treasury has published a list of 41 entities that are barred from public contracts because of work in Iran.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CCA Civil and its parent entities don't appear on barred lists in New Jersey or New York, nor on a similar list maintained by the <span class="companylink">U.S. Treasury Department</span>, its attorneys say in court and state departmental filings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the appeals, Conti's attorneys argue for a broader interpretation of the state law. CCA Civil "shares a common owner, and is under common control, with entities" performing prohibited work, the company's appeal alleges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that charge depends on the definition of corporate ownership and control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its response to the appeals, CCA Civil cites Chinese law in asserting that the Chinese government doesn't control the company or its parent companies, and isn't the direct owner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such details will be hard to settle at the state level, Ms. Damrosch said. Resolution will be especially difficult, she said, if different states begin to establish different standards by which companies can be held accountable for the actions of affiliates overseas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Several business groups in the past have waged a campaign both in legislatures and in the courts to try to strike down what they perceive as impediments to ordinary foreign trade," she said, citing a 2000 Supreme Court decision that struck down a Massachusetts law barring the state from doing business with companies active in Myanmar. "But then presumably you've got local business interests here who think, 'Well, if we can change the playing field for procurement by excluding certain foreign businesses from contracts, that could be good for business.'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2010 Iran act took that precedent into account, she said, specifically authorizing states to establish their own lists of companies active in the country, modeled on lists maintained by the State Department and the Treasury.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Gabby Warshawer </div><div>1018 words</div><div>12 July 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A18</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three new hotels have opened in the Herald Square area in recent months, joining numerous others that have been built nearby over the past several years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, a 167-room Courtyard by Marriott opened on the corner of Sixth Avenue and 35th Street, immediately adjacent to a 298-room Hilton Garden Inn that opened in 2009 and a 146-room Hampton Inn that opened in late 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On 36th Street between Fifth and Sixth avenues, a 94-room Best Western Premier opened at the end of May. It is next to two other hotels that also opened earlier this year -- a 135-room Holiday Inn Express and a 185-room Hyatt Place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And one block to the north, on 37th Street between Fifth and Sixth avenues, a 173-room SpringHill Suites opened in mid-May. It is sandwiched between the 177-room Strand Hotel and a 92-room Fairfield Inn &amp; Suites, both of which opened in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan-based <span class="companylink">Hidrock Realty</span> developed two of the properties, the SpringHill Suites and the Courtyard by Marriott; the latter involved converting an office building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates at the two are averaging close to $300 a night, said Eddie Hidary, a principal with Hidrock. The average daily room rate in Manhattan in 2012 was $284, according to PKF Consulting, a firm that tracks hotel trends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hidary said he isn't worried about a glut of hotels in the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The hotels being built are relatively small," he said, adding that Herald Square's status as an international tourist and business destination has only grown stronger in recent years, leading to increased demand for rooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We all know it's changed a lot over the last decade," said Mr. Hidary. "It's really flourished and become a 24-7 destination."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Jaz Patel, a principal with Long Island City-based LeTap Group, which developed the Best Western on 36th Street, not all of the guests staying in the area's hotels are leisure travelers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We originally thought it would be all tourist, but we have noticed corporate people staying there," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Patel said the property's occupancy rate has hovered around 95% and room rates have averaged roughly $225 a night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both developers said the decision to build hotels was driven in large part by regulations around Herald Square, most of which isn't zoned for residential construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another move involving the area's hospitality industry, <span class="companylink">Vornado Realty Trust</span>, the owner of the 1,700-room Hotel Pennsylvania, said in March that it had decided against going ahead with plans to raze the building situated across from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of a new development that had long been envisioned for the Seventh Avenue site, Vornado Chairman Steven Roth said at an investors' conference that the early-20th century hotel would be renovated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vornado declined to comment further this week on its current plans for the hotel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, renovation is under way at two Herald Square-area landmarks: <span class="companylink">Macy's</span> and the Empire State Building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Macy's</span> last year began a $400 million, four-year renovation of its flagship store. Many of its retail areas are being reconfigured; this year, several sections of the main floor are being remodeled, including those for cosmetics, jewelry and handbags.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Down the street, the Empire State Building is renovating to make the tower more energy efficient. The $20 million, multiyear project involves measures such as upgrading electrical and ventilation systems and overhauling office spaces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The entire area has seen dramatic quality-of-life improvements over the past two decades, according to Dan Biederman, president of the 34th Street Partnership, the business improvement district that includes Herald Square.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The district in the early '90s still looked like New York before the '70s and '80s went away," according to Mr. Biederman. He said the BID had worked with police and other city agencies to reduce crime and to clean up litter and graffiti.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You felt a hostile environment, but now tourists and shoppers feel more comfortable," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As has happened in Times Square and in other sections of New York City, Herald Square became more pedestrian friendly in 2009 when vehicle-free islands were created on Broadway between 33rd and 35th streets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A more recent measure intended to ease traffic gridlock in the area was rolled out in 2011 with the introduction of a so-called Select Bus Service route along 34th Street. The designated buses incorporate various measures to speed up service, including collecting fares from passengers before they board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the advent of residential projects, brokers say most new apartment development that has taken place in the area has clustered on Fifth Avenue and points west of Herald Square.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a shopping mecca but there's no grocery store," said Chazz Levi, a broker with <span class="companylink">Corcoran Group</span>. "It's not there as a residential neighborhood yet."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nancy Keates </div><div>1828 words</div><div>12 July 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Designer Kendall Wilkinson recently completed an ambitious renovation on a 3,000-square-foot penthouse in San Francisco's Nob Hill. She gutted the apartment, adding a den and putting in leather walls, marble floors, new molding, a high-end kitchen with features by designer Christopher Peacock and Waterworks fixtures. She also designed a closet with custom built-ins, turned a bedroom into a library and made three bedrooms into two bathrooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her clients spent about $1 million on the upgrade. But when their lease is up, they will be leaving most of these improvements behind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In competitive real-estate markets, some luxury renters are making a surprising decision: putting tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars into upgrades on their temporary lodgings. They are investing in redos at a time when rental vacancies nationwide are at their lowest since 2001 -- currently at 4.3%, according to real-estate research firm Reis. Meanwhile, rents have been rising rapidly, up 3.8% over the past year. The result: More renters are deciding to stay put and put their money into improving their current homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People don't want to live in something that's not up to their standards. They're willing to make big changes even if they'll only be there a couple of years," says Noble Black, a broker with Corcoran in New York, where the vacancy rate was just 1.9% in the first quarter of 2013, down from 2.1% a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My friends think I'm crazy. But if it's something you're going to live in for the next three years, you don't mind spending the money. It's worth it. It's about lifestyle," says Daniel de la Vega, who looked for a rental for eight months in Miami and couldn't find exactly what he wanted. He eventually settled on an apartment that had the finishes he liked, but a floor plan that seemed too constricting. He tore down a wall to eliminate one of the bedrooms and make the living room larger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. de la Vega, a managing partner of One Sotheby's Realty in Miami, received permission from his landlord to make the changes. What he didn't get was any reduction in the rent in exchange for his investment. His lease, which is two years with a one-year renewal option, specifies he must return the apartment to the way it was before he made the changes. But he isn't worried he will have to put back the wall. "I know when I'm done he will love it so much he won't make me," he says of the landlord.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the vast majority of redos by renters tend to be superficial -- such as a new paint job or carpeting -- landlords and building managers across the country report they are also seeing far more expensive and elaborate renovations. They are also getting more requests for structural changes such as knocking down walls, adding new bathrooms and custom built-in closets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm really amazed at how much people invest even when they're just renting," says Isabelle Higson, who owns a portfolio of residential rental buildings in San Francisco with her sister and brother, including the Brocklebank Apartments on Nob Hill. Her renters have installed new malachite sinks in the bathrooms, torn out older kitchens, replaced them with newer models and recovered walls with wood paneling and even leather. Not one of those changes has cost Ms. Higson a dime -- they have all been paid for by her tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffry Weisman, a 53-year-old interior designer who lives in one of Ms. Higson's buildings, did his first renovation shortly after he moved in 20 years ago, spending about $100,000 to remodel the master bedroom and kitchen. Five years ago, after his now-husband moved in, they invested about $200,000 in another extensive remodel: They tore down walls to create a formal dining room, added new molding and wall panels with antique mirrors, covered the ceiling with pewter-leaf tea paper, updated all the lighting and refinished the floors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For long-term renters such as Mr. Weisman, there is another reason to invest in renovations, rather than moving: Strict regulations on how much landlords can increase their annual rents on some apartments in cities such as San Francisco and New York can make staying put an especially affordable proposition. Mr. Weisman declined to say how much he currently pays in rent, but says it is "substantially less" than the $6,500 a month that a similar apartment on another floor rents for. Building management says an apartment similar to Mr. Weisman's is actually going for $10,000 a month now; rents in his building range from $2,900 a month for a one bedroom that is been rented by the same owner for decades to $20,000 for a three-bedroom apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marsha Monro, a marketing consultant who moved into a one-bedroom apartment at the Brockleback three years ago, began renovating before she moved in. She knocked down a wall between the kitchen and dining room, put in new stainless-steel appliances and Carrera marble counters in the kitchen, installed a new vanity, sink and shower in the bathroom, added new molding to the walls, platinum-leafed the fireplace mantle, put in 9-foot mirrors and refinished the floors, spending about $20,000 in all. She says she is never leaving: "You'll see me here 40 years from now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We love it -- as long as they run everything by us first," says Ms. Higson of her tenants' remodeling projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all landlords are thrilled when their tenants make changes, however. Renovations can be expensive to get rid of and make the place less attractive to potential future renters. Josh Weiss found that out after a tenant spent about $50,000 renovating a 5,000-square-foot triplex in a building he owns in Manhattan's Greenwich Village. The changes were mostly superficial -- window treatments, wallpaper, tiling -- but the style was so distinctive (black and white "Versailles-like" wallpaper, unusual paint colors) that Mr. Weiss asked the tenants to take it all out before they left. He estimates undoing the renovations cost the tenants, who stayed about two years, about $30,000. With the triplex's rental price at $30,000 a month, he says he couldn't risk keeping the unusual decor and hoping someone with similar taste would come along.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Higson ran into a similar problem at the Brocklebank when she allowed a tenant to leave without undoing a malachite bathroom with gold fixtures and a kitchen she describes as "tricked out." Despite a lot of demand for apartments in the building, she had a hard time finding tenants willing to take that unit. "People would see it and say 'oh dear'," she says. She eventually rented the apartment to someone from Brazil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most rental contracts include a clause that the unit has to be returned to the same condition it was leased -- but whether that is enforced is usually decided on a case-by-case basis, says Gary Malin, president of Citi Habitats, a New York real-estate company. He says most landlords let the changes remain if they are neutral enough. "They don't like improvements specific to one person's taste. They want it to be universal," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These rules can mean a tightrope walk for architects and interior designers. "You can't move too many walls and you can't touch the heating," says Ms. Wilkinson, the San Francisco-based designer. Ms. Wilkinson says she does a major rental renovation about every year now in this market: In San Francisco, the rental vacancy fell to 3.2% in the first quarter this year, down from 5% a year earlier, while rents have risen 5.7% over the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many landlords would rather do the work themselves. They will allow the tenants to pick out the tiles or appliances, but they will hire the contractors and oversee the work, charging the clients for the total project cost. "That gives me control over the quality of what's installed and the quality of who is installing it," says Rob Goodman, chief executive of Los Angeles based <span class="companylink">Resmark Cos</span>., which opened the Avenue in Hollywood, Calif. His company charges about $125 a foot to replace the standard carpeting with wood floors and about $1,500 to put in track lighting. The only large-scale renovation that required the tenant to pay for removal was a unit rented by a hip-hop producer who built in expensive shelves for his collection of rare limited-edition sneakers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daria Salusbury, who leads luxury residential leasing operations for real-estate firm Related Companies, says the company started combining apartments because of requests from current tenants. A typical case: A couple at the company's MiMA building in midtown Manhattan wanted to take a two-bedroom, 1,500-square-foot unit and merge it with a 1,000-square-foot, one-bedroom unit next door. The company paid for and oversaw the construction and raised the monthly rent on the combined apartments to more than $20,000 from $11,000. "They're happy, they signed a two-year lease and we'll be able to rent it to someone else," says Ms. Salusbury.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a would-be renter likes an apartment but isn't fully sold on it, knowing they can make changes can make the difference, brokers say. Eric Hantman, CEO and founder of New York brokerage firm Prime NY, always advises landlords to approve any renovations they deem will have lasting value. He recently had a client who wanted all new stainless-steel appliances for the kitchen and new wall coverings; the landlord ended up splitting the cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And allowing a tenant to invest in improvements can mean keeping that renter for years to come. Myles Horn spent about $100,000 several years ago to renovate the aging apartment he has rented for 18 years in a prewar building on Manhattan's Upper West Side. He and his wife put in new bathrooms, installed new kitchen appliances and updated the fixtures and molding. "We're comfortable there. We are used to the space," explains Mr. Horn, a real-estate developer, who says several other tenants in his building also have done extensive renovations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Horn, who has a two-year lease and declines to state how much he pays in rent, says every time the lease has been renewed there has been an increase in rent -- except the year he did the renovations. He and his wife have no plans to leave.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anya Martin   </div><div>699 words</div><div>12 July 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sam Bamieh is asking $29 million for his historic, 35,000-square-foot mansion in the San Francisco Bay area that has been on and off the market for more than 10 years. Earlier this year he put it back on the market, with this financial incentive: If the buyer agrees to finance 40% of the purchase directly with him, he'll offer a 3.8% 30-year, fixed interest rate and reduce the price to $26 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What is unusual about this deal is the dollar amount, the size, the term and that the interest rate is as low as a 30-year fixed rate mortgage," said Phil Chen, a luxury real-estate broker at Hillsborough, Calif.-based Sybarite Investments/Keller Williams Peninsula Real Estate, and one of the listing agents on the estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seller financing can seal the deal in some -- but not all -- high-end markets, said Walt Danley, a luxury real-estate agent affiliated with Christie's International Real Estate based in Paradise Valley, Ariz. In this form of financing, the seller holds on to the note, which is secured by the property, and the buyer makes principal and interest payments to the seller instead of a bank or other lender.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Phoenix-area market was troubled, Mr. Danley says he didn't see any seller financing. In the past nine months, however, that has changed. "We've had so many short sales or foreclosures around here that we have buyers who can't get a mortgage," Mr. Danley said. "They are asking the seller to carry the debt till they can clean up their credit and get a mortgage on their own."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Danley has closed five seller-financed loans, also called carry-back loans, in the past nine months, all for amounts above $1 million, including one for a $3 million home, he said. In one case, a house that had sat on the market for two years got three offers after an option of seller financing was added, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typical terms in Arizona are for the seller to carry the loan for five years, but amortize it for 30 years like a 30-year fixed rate mortgage, Mr. Danley said. In exchange for the financing, the seller accepts a higher interest rate, usually prime plus two points, currently about 5.25%, he added. "That's a much better interest rate than a seller can get at a bank, and it's good for the buyers in that they can get the house at today's lower prices," he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, some sellers, especially retirees who have paid down a mortgage, see seller financing as an income generator, said Dawn Rickenbaugh, a Temple, Calif.-based real-estate broker who specializes in seller financing. Ms. Rickenbaugh also purchases carry-back notes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With jumbo loans now easier to get, however, buyers may not need to use seller financing as an alternative, said Guy Cecala, publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance, which tracks loan originations. "The availability of jumbo financing, at least up to $5 million, is pretty easy to come by," he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some more considerations for buyers and sellers entertaining seller financing versus a traditional lender-based jumbo mortgage:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Include a buyback clause. Like a lender, a seller can sell the loan to an investor, but borrowers can protect themselves by including a clause in the mortgage agreement granting them first right of refusal to buy the note at the same discount offered by any buyer, Ms. Rickenbaugh said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Underwater doesn't matter. Lenders require appraisals, but in seller financing, the deal comes down to whether the buyer will accept the seller's price and terms, Ms. Rickenbaugh said. On the other hand, if the seller is asking an above-market price, buyers can leverage an appraisal to negotiate a lower interest rate, she added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Get professional help to qualify. Sellers always should have an experienced accountant or lawyer assess a buyer's creditworthiness, Mr. Danley said. "A Realtor is not qualified to look at a credit report," he added.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Josh Barbanel   </div><div>782 words</div><div>11 July 2013</div><div>00:04</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shortage of listings and frothy activity reported in the Manhattan market is broadening to communities elsewhere in the city and nearby areas, driving up the price of condos in Long Island City, co-ops in Brooklyn Heights and single family houses in White Plains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A series of market reports to be released on Thursday paint a picture of a hot market in the region in the second quarter as buyers—including many worried about rising interest rates on mortgages—competed for a shrinking supply of available property. There were also some negatives in the market. Tight credit conditions made it hard for would-be sellers to trade up to larger apartments, shrinking the available supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers said that as the housing recovery strengthens, strong market activity is moving from the most in-demand neighborhoods to others that had been bypassed in earlier stages of the upswing. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Brooklyn, the market was so tight that brokers brought in extra staff to handle crowds—of 50 to 60 people in some cases—that have started to show up at open houses, said Frank Percesepe, who oversees <span class="companylink">Corcoran Group</span>'s operations in Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"June has been the most incredible month in the history of Brooklyn sales," Mr. Percesepe said. He said inventory fell during the second quarter even though the increasing prices had "whet the appetite of sellers" because many new listings were selling quickly. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a Brooklyn co-op, condo or house jumped to $550,000 during the second quarter, surpassing a high-water market of $539,672 at the peak of the real-estate boom in the summer of 2006, according to a market report from <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> prepared by appraiser Jonathan Miller. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That price was up 15.3% from the year-earlier quarter, while inventory fell by 18.5%. With fewer listings available, especially a shrinking supply of apartments for sale in new condo buildings, the number of sales fell by nearly 7%. Median co-op prices were up 22%. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Westchester County, Chris Meyers, the managing principal of Houlihan Lawrence, said the quarter was the strongest second period since 2007, and that since then market remained "scorching hot" into the summer. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Houlihan Lawrence market report found that sales during the second quarter were the strongest they have been since 2007. Sales were up 24% compared with 2012, nearly double the number of sales in 2009. The median price of a single-family home during the second quarter was $650,000, up 5% from the same quarter last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the early stages of recovery, the strongest activities were limited to Westchester neighborhoods closest to New York City. But now he said that activity picked up across the county, with sales in and around White Plains up by 67% from the year-earlier second quarter. Towns along the Hudson, from Hastings-on-Hudson through Briarcliff Manor and Ossining, saw sales rise 28% and prices climb 8% in the quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Meyers said some buyers had locked in interest rates and were rushing to close their deals. He said he expected price increases to moderate because a bump up in interest rates and higher monthly mortgage costs would limit how much some buyers could afford to spend.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strong market has led to rising prices and quick sales at new developments, and highlighted a structural change in the market: After the real-estate market fell, lenders were reluctant to finance condominiums, so many developers put up rentals instead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Cohen, a 30-year-old a computer-systems administrator and a first-time home buyer, is in contract to buy a one bedroom with a balcony at Five27, a new five-story red brick condo in Long Island City in Queens, about 1½ blocks from the waterfront. The price was $605,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Cohen's broker, Chris Austad of Corcoran, said that Five27, with a total of 27 apartment, has been raising prices steadily and Mr. Cohen wound up paying a bit more than he expected. "There are tons of buyers coming over from Brooklyn," he said. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This stepped up activity has in turn triggered a bounce in the Queens market. Median prices were up 9.9% to $390,000, according to <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>, and the number of sales rose 8.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About the only slightly down note was a new report on Thursday showing that the average rent on Manhattan apartment was down $19 a month from June 2012, according to Citi Habitats.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Jersey's highest court blocked Gov. Chris Christie's attempt to abolish an independent agency overseeing the construction of affordable-housing units in the state, a setback to the Republican governor's efforts to reshape government through his executive powers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state Supreme Court ruled 5-2 Wednesday that Mr. Christie couldn't abolish the Council on Affordable Housing, an agency charged with allocating funds for housing developments for lower-income residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ruling was cheered by affordable-housing advocates, who have repeatedly sued the administration to stop its efforts to reduce New Jersey's building requirements for those of lesser means. Democrats called the decision a check on Mr. Christie's powers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Today's decision makes it clear that the governor cannot ignore the law," said state Sen. Raymond Lesniak, a Democrat who has clashed with Mr. Christie on housing policies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response, Mr. Christie called the decision an "activist opinion" and attacked the "liberal" state Supreme Court. Democrats have thwarted the governor's efforts to appoint more conservative nominees to the highest court, and Mr. Christie has called the judicial roadblock one of the most trying aspects of his first term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This only steels my determination to continue to fight to bring common sense back to New Jersey's judiciary," Mr. Christie said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing agency has a number of vacancies on its board, and hasn't met regularly since 2011. The state Department of Community Affairs declined to comment on questions about the ruling's immediate impact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Jersey, one of the most densely populated states, has a long history of struggles over affordable housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A suit against the Burlington County township of Mount Laurel in 1975 paved the way for a series of court decisions that required New Jersey municipalities to each allow for a certain amount of affordable housing. In 1985, the Legislature created the Council on Affordable Housing to establish regulations for each municipality to meet its housing requirements, typically through zoning changes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, New Jersey towns have created 60,242 affordable-housing units and rehabilitated 14,854 more, according to state data through 2011. The largest numbers were built in Newark, Edison and Bridgewater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The definition of "affordability" varies across the state, but the upper threshold is a purchase price of about $160,000 for a home or $1,200 a month for rent. Income limits vary by region and family size, and caps out at $84,000 for a family of four in the most affluent counties, state guidelines show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he ran for office in 2009, Mr. Christie campaigned to streamline government. In 2011, he submitted a plan to abolish the affordable-housing agency and transfer its duties over to the state Department of Community Affairs. Housing groups sued in response, and the case reached the Supreme Court in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The administration argued that a state law allowing for the reorganization of executive departments also gave it the power to close independent agencies. Housing advocates disagreed and the court sided with them, arguing that the Legislature and governor would have to pass a law to eliminate an independent agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision is legally significant in that the court rarely has checked the governor's powers, said Peter Verniero, a retired state Supreme Court justice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think it's one of the most important decisions of this court's term," Mr. Verniero said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Politically, the decision is a rare defeat for Mr. Christie, who has been effective in negotiating his agenda with the Democratic-controlled Legislature, said Ben Dworkin, director of the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the decision is expected to have little negative impact on Mr. Christie's re-election for governor in the fall, and his attacks on the court for rulings seen as too overreaching could boost any national ambitions he holds, according to Mr. Dworkin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This will be part of a larger narrative. Chris Christie took on the liberal Supreme Court," Mr. Dworkin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is unclear how the decision will impact the affordable-housing projects pending before the agency, including several that would build new units in areas of the state devastated by superstorm Sandy.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese real-estate corporate-bond prices have fallen for eight consecutive weeks, stung by a one-two punch of investors fleeing emerging-market debt and worries over China's real-estate market. The selloff is the worst since the peak of the global financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This marks a sharp reversal of fortunes for the bonds, which had been popular earlier in the year because of their high yields. While home prices in China still are rising, the outlook has darkened. Analysts say last month's cash squeeze in the banking system could portend higher borrowing costs for home buyers, which in turn would hurt the outlook for property sales and developers' ability to repay debt in coming years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Chinese property players are healthy at the moment, with pretty good sales revenue and cash flow," said Jacphanie Cheung, credit analyst at <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank AG</span>. "But property sales may slow down, as the easy credit that fueled strong housing demand may no longer be available after significant bank lending to the property sector in the first quarter."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> index that tracks 78 property bonds shows prices started declining in the middle of May, pushing the average yield up to 9.3% from 7%. One example is a 10-year bond issued by <span class="companylink">Country Garden Holdings Co</span>., one of China's largest developers, which fell 15% between mid-May and July 5. The yield, which moves inversely to prices, surged to nearly 9% from 6.5% over the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signs that the U.S. Federal Reserve plans to pull back from its aggressive stimulus efforts triggered a global selloff that in turn pushed Chinese real-estate corporate-bond prices lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently, growing concerns at home have left the real-estate bonds suffering more than other debt in Asia. Sovereign bonds around the region that are rated as investment grade have climbed roughly 4% from their lowest point in late June after losing 12% from a peak in early May. Bonds of companies in the region with pristine credit ratings were up 1% as of July 5, after sliding nearly 5% earlier, according to the J.P. Morgan <span class="companylink">Asia Credit</span> Index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worries are persisting in the property market that Beijing may introduce further tightening measures to tame sky-high prices, which recorded their biggest gain in nearly two years last month. The most-recent effort to curb prices came last month when the government tightened approvals on presale permits for new high-end property projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Government curbs may be imposed again to tame climbing property prices," said <span class="companylink">Deutsche</span>'s Ms. Cheung. "These will hurt developers' income sources going forward."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said bond prices may fall if outflows continue from Asia amid mounting jitters over the European debt crisis and worries over the Fed's pullback. Chinese bond funds have experienced three consecutive weeks of net outflows, according to data tracker EPFR Global.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"U.S. and global funds, which typically don't invest beyond developed markets, went shopping in Asian emerging markets for higher yields earlier this year," said Gary Dugan, chief investment officer of private bank Coutts. "But they also scaled back more quickly due to uncertainties," notably the potential for the Fed to reduce its bond buying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dugan said he has been avoiding the bonds of Chinese developers since April and is holding only investment-grade debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks of Hong Kong-listed Chinese real-estate firms also have suffered. Two large developers, <span class="companylink">China Resources Land Ltd</span>. and <span class="companylink">Shimao Property Holdings Ltd</span>., are both down around 14% since the end of May, in line with overall Chinese stocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm still confident about the fundamentals of Chinese property firms, which have raised much cheap debt to strengthen their financials," said Leong Wai Hoong, a fixed-income portfolio manager at <span class="companylink">Nikko Asset Management</span>, which manages about $162 billion of assets. "But the timing to go bottom-fishing won't be right until U.S. Treasurys stabilize and market volatility subsides. I prefer reserving more cash at the moment."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LAS VEGAS -- In a city dotted with tens of thousands of vacant houses, Jericho Guarin figured it would be easy to buy his first home. But nearly a year after beginning a search late last summer, he has come up dry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It has been a nightmare," says the 37-year-old U.S. Air Force officer. "There are plenty of empty houses, but they're just not for sale."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, it is a lopsided equation. The number of available homes has plunged here after a sweeping state law subjected lenders to stiff new foreclosure rules and penalties. With banks exercising caution, many homeowners -- including those seriously delinquent on their loans -- have been allowed to remain in place. As a result, there is little on the market at a time when first-time buyers and real-estate speculators are anxious to tap both cheap prices and low-interest mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many real-estate agents, home builders and consumer advocates argue that the law, intended to remedy foreclosure-processing abuses, has backfired. Some owners who are behind on payments aren't maintaining their homes as banks refrain from eviction proceedings. The perverse outcome: Inventory shortages have spurred new developments despite a glut of properties stuck in foreclosure limbo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The people hurt most by this law are the middle class," says Steve Hawks, a real-estate agent in Henderson, Nev. He refers to the phenomenon wrought by the foreclosure measure, Assembly Bill 284, as the "A.B. 284 bubble."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until last decade's housing boom, prices didn't rise much here, making it possible for casino dealers or cocktail waitresses to buy into the American dream. Now, a tight market is pushing up values and making it harder for buyers to find homes to purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Guarin, the Air Force Captain, is preapproved for a mortgage backed by the Veterans Administration for up to $185,000. But like many buyers who need financing, he is at a severe disadvantage because sellers often prefer all-cash deals that won't be tied up by a low appraisal or other red tape. "There's no way I can match the cash offers," says Mr. Guarin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With investors in the game, more properties are commanding prices above asking -- a phenomenon real-estate agent Bryan Lebo knows all too well. Recently, he listed a bank-owned property for $86,000. The home, which he said needed around $20,000 in repairs, drew 41 offers -- 39 of them all-cash -- and sold to an investor for $135,000. "If you're an honest working person, you pretty much don't have a chance," says Mr. Lebo of current market conditions. All cash transactions accounted for nearly 60% of sales in May, according to DataQuick. Nationally, all cash transactions accounted for roughly a third of sales in the month, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory shortages, meanwhile, have been a boon for some -- especially builders. "A.B. 284 has been great for us. It darn near eliminated the constant inflow of foreclosures on the resale market," says Robert Beville, president of Harmony Homes, a local home builder. Mr. Beville says Harmony has sold 57 homes this year to cash buyers, compared to 70 in all of 2012. Realtors say investors are planning to flip the homes to a new buyer on the bet that prices will have jumped even more by the time the homes are built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real-estate boom and bust hit few places as hard as Las Vegas, where home prices doubled from 2002 to 2006 before falling by 62% through early last year. Fed up with piecemeal efforts by the federal government to create voluntary foreclosure-relief programs, a number of states and local governments proposed measures to raise the costs associated with foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Nevada, the measures were particularly tough. A.B. 284 threatened criminal penalties for bank officials who didn't follow new rules to certify that foreclosures were being processed properly -- a reaction to the "robo-signing" scandal of late 2010, when employees at some of the nation's largest banks allegedly forged foreclosure paperwork as a routine practice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among other changes, the Nevada law made it a felony for anyone making false representations concerning real-estate title. Large lenders grew reluctant to foreclose on properties due to ambiguous language in the law, says Bill Uffelman, president of the Nevada Bankers Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Nevada law "just stopped foreclosures cold," says local developer Tom McCormick. In October 2011, the first month after the law took effect, lenders filed just 600 notices of default, an 88% drop from the previous month, according to PropertyRadar. Banks' inventories of foreclosed properties subsequently plunged. In May, foreclosed homes, which accounted for half of all homes sold here in recent years, represented just 11% of home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists fear that some states like Nevada run the risk of overreaching with laws that create as many problems as they solve. Studies by researchers at the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of Boston</span> show that "delaying the foreclosure process does not in the end lead to fewer foreclosures," said Paul Willen, a senior economist at the <span class="companylink">Boston Fed</span>. "If they're delaying a foreclosure that is going to happen eventually, what we're really concerned about is that they're reducing the quality of life for the neighborhood."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Backers of the foreclosure bill say the law has been unfairly cited as the cause for the drop-off in distressed-property listings that has fueled the market rebound. "It is not all 284," said Catherine Cortez Masto, the Nevada attorney general who was an early sponsor of the measure. "Do I think it had an impact and slowed down foreclosures? Absolutely."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some ways, the real-estate narrative here reflects a tale of two cities. That is because, in basic economic terms, the trends haven't been all bad for the city or its residents. The foreclosure delays have helped distressed homeowners like Scott Chatley, who went 54 months without making a mortgage payment. That gave him enough time to pay off debts, repair his credit, and begin saving for a down payment on his next home. Mr. Chatley, who bought a home here in 2005 for $495,000 with no money down, stopped making his $4,000 monthly mortgage payments in mid-2008 when he lost his job as a software engineer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Chatley says he delayed foreclosure first by seeking loan modifications and then by filing for bankruptcy. His mortgage company, <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>., last fall approved a short sale of his home for $169,000 to an investor. Though he moved out in September, Mr. Chatley says he probably could have stayed longer because the bank hadn't been actively moving along the foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, he was prequalified by a credit union for a new mortgage and hopes to buy a new place later this year or early next. "If I see a rule that exists to help me recover without having to do anything illegal, why would I not use that?" says Mr. Chatley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> spokesman said it isn't able to tell how much, if any, effect the state law had on Mr. Chatley's foreclosure delay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory situation has also allowed more builders to get back into the game. According to the most recent available statistics, Las Vegas had just 4,300 previously owned homes listed for sale in April, down 70% from two years ago. New home sales, meanwhile, are up by 87% so far this year. Overall home prices have risen by 22% in the year ending in April -- more than double the growth for the U.S. as a whole, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home-price index. So far this year, the number of new building permits issued for new home construction is up 52% from the year-ago period -- one of the largest jumps in the nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regulators, meanwhile, have raised concerns about the unintended consequences of stalled foreclosures. In some states, "much of the supply of homes that should be available for sale is locked up," says Edward DeMarco, the acting director of the agency that controls mortgage-finance giants <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, in a March speech to economists. "We have seen the somewhat perverse result of home-building activity expanding while a considerable backlog of homes languished in the foreclosure pipeline."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lack of affordable homes for resale prompted buyers like Dennis Jordan to turn to the new-home market. "We figured that would be a cut-and-dry deal, but it turns out it's not," says the 66-year-old retired construction manager, who lives in Greenwood, Ind., and wants to move with his wife to Las Vegas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jordan spent six months looking for an existing home and another three months looking for new properties before he signed a contract to pay $362,500 on a four-bedroom house that broke ground last month. The home, which was about 10% above his initial budget, should be completed by September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many builders are raising prices for homes on their existing lots. Increasingly, buyers must join wait lists or enter lotteries for the chance to bid on new homes. At a development called Villa Trieste, <span class="companylink">Pulte Homes</span> is selling new Tuscan-style two-bedrooms starting at $261,000. A year ago, comparable newly built homes sold for $190,000 and previously owned homes sold for around $160,000. A spokeswoman for Pulte says it has been able to raise prices due to less competition from foreclosures and low interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all developers are so optimistic. Some worry that there is still a sizable inventory of distressed homes that could hit the market, leading prices of all homes to soften. Mr. McCormick, chief executive of Astoria Homes, stopped building homes five years ago and said he hopes to break ground on his first project this summer. But he is in no hurry to dive in headlong. "I'm still very worried about the foreclosures -- the same way people said we didn't have a bubble and then we did," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the nation's 30 largest metro areas, Las Vegas had the highest share of loans that were 90 days or more past due but not yet referred to foreclosure as of April, according to the most recent data from Lender Processing Services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly 45,000 loans are either 90 days or more past due or in foreclosure. Local electric-utility data showed nearly 64,000 vacant homes at the end of last September, according to a tally by analysts at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas. Fewer than 8,000 of those units were listed for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lag in foreclosures has had other deleterious effects. Homeowners' associations aren't collecting dues from borrowers who are behind on their mortgages. Some associations have begun taking advantage of their rights to file liens ahead of the bank -- and then sell the liens to investors, who pay a few thousand dollars for the right to take control of the home until the bank forecloses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors buy the liens "in the hopes that the mortgage is going to be lost in la-la-land, and the bank won't foreclose for six months or two years," says Richard Weiss, a real-estate investor who said he has taken ownership of around seven properties. While waiting for the bank to get its act together and foreclose, "you can do whatever you want -- put a tenant in there and collect the rent," says Mr. Weiss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors "know they can rent out these properties and get a cash flow without having to spend much money," says Xenophon Peters, an attorney who represents clients facing foreclosure at the law firm Peters &amp; Associates LLP. He says a few large investors have been buying up hundreds of the liens. The practice is "terrible" but legal, he said. "They're just taking advantage of the law."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weiss argues that renting out the houses is better for the communities than leaving them vacant. "You had vandals coming in and destroying these homes," he says. "These were eyesores on the community."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A.B. 284's supporters maintain that the law was never a "borrower-protection bill" intended to prevent foreclosures. Instead, they say it was designed to safeguard buyers of foreclosed properties from having title problems associated with defective repossessions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, concerns raised by the real-estate industry earlier this year prompted Ms. Cortez Masto, a Democrat, to convene a working group that proposed a series of technical revisions. The amendments, signed into law last month, require that officials certify to having "business knowledge" of loan ownership from written corporate records, as opposed to the more open-ended "personal knowledge" requirement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Mr. Peters sees little to celebrate. Even though A.B. 284 has benefited his clients, "there has to be turnover in the housing market for it to recover," he says. "It's caused another bubble to erupt. We saw the same thing eight years ago. We know it's unsustainable."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kris Hudson </div><div>782 words</div><div>10 July 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few brave developers are venturing back into the Caribbean luxury-hotel and resort market, one of the sectors hit hardest during the global real-estate downturn. But only developers with ample financing in the busiest markets are getting off the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Caribbean overall remains littered with half-built resorts and villas that stalled in 2008 and 2009 after banks and investors pulled financing. Among those that still languish are a Four Seasons in Barbados and a Westin property in St.Lucia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a few well-financed developers are breaking ground again, including Dart Realty (Cayman) Ltd., which plans to start construction in September on a 263-room boutique hotel in Grand Cayman in the Cayman Islands that will be operated by <span class="companylink">Kimpton Hotel &amp; Restaurant Group LLC</span>. The project, near Dart's Camana Bay development on Grand Cayman's Seven Mile Beach, also will include 56 condominiums and beach bungalows for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company will finance the $170 million project with its own capital rather than seeking construction loans from banks, said Jackie Doak, Dart's chief operating officer. The hotel, which is being built on the site of a former Courtyard by Marriott hotel that Dart razed earlier this year, will be the first that San Francisco-based Kimpton will manage in the Caribbean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Doak said Dart is moving ahead with the project's residences that are for sale because most of its prospective buyers are from the northeastern U.S., where homeowners weren't as badly burned by the recession and where she says the appetite for vacation homes is rising. Prices in the Camana Bay area now average $900 to $1,100 a square foot for luxury residences that can sell for $1.7 million to $5 million, according to Cayman Islands Sotheby's International Realty. Dart hasn't set prices for its residences. "We anticipate that, once we take this product to market, we'll be quickly absorbed," Ms. Doak said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Caribbean Property Group, a New York-based company that develops commercial and residential property in the Caribbean, was able to complete construction last December on its 115-room Ritz Carlton Reserve resort in Puerto Rico's Dorado Beach. The company says it benefited from its location in a populous U.S. commonwealth rather than a remote island. Official backing helped: The developer received $230 million in loans guaranteed by the Puerto Rican government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ritz at Dorado Beach includes 14 completed residences and another 14 under construction. They have sold at prices ranging from $3.2 million to $8 million, Principal Kenneth Blatt said. Most buyers are paying in cash, and many are comforted by the project's U.S. financing, which entails the developer putting buyers' deposits into escrow. That is in contrast to spending the money on construction, as is common practice in the Caribbean. "Clearly, we have an advantage being in Puerto Rico, with its connection to the U.S.," Mr. Blatt said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Barbados, Couples Resorts leased the former Almond Resort last year to spend several million dollars redeveloping it into a luxury, all-inclusive hotel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, any upscale or luxury resort under construction in the Caribbean is the exception to the rule these days. The Caribbean always has been an expensive place to build and operate a resort, given that costs for materials and importing are high, labor sometimes is scarce, the weather can be severe, and tourists can be finicky. Adding to this, the global economic downturn scared away many banks and villa buyers from investing in the already-risky market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Expansion of the Caribbean's hotel stock remains tepid. If all 15 Caribbean hotels (1,502 rooms) slated to open this year do so, that will amount to a growth rate of less than 0.1%, according to Lodging Econometrics. In comparison, Caribbean hotels opened in 2008 resulted in a 3.4% growth rate for the region. In the U.S., developers are expected to open 501 hotels (55,308 rooms) this year, notching a 1.1% growth rate, according to Lodging Econometrics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A primary reason for the Caribbean construction lull, aside from the inherent risks, is that it is far cheaper to buy and redevelop an existing resort on the islands than to build a new one. Chicago-based AJ Capital Partners bought the shuttered, 55-room Malliouhana resort in Anguilla in February and intends to renovate the luxury boutique resort and reopen it next year.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the 1960s, Leonard Litwin and the other executives at Glenwood Management have had a steady focus on constructing and owning luxury rental buildings across Manhattan: They have put up 25 buildings, with two more on the way, for a total of more than 8,000 apartments, making Glenwood one of the city's biggest private landlords.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now, with superluxury condo prices on the rise, the 98-year-old Mr. Litwin has joined the stampede of developers building over-size condominiums for the wealthy. Glenwood has filed plans with the city and state to put up a 19-story condominium on East 86th Street that will have only 15 apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas Juul-Hansen, the architect who created the interiors at the 1,004-foot One57 tower under construction on West 57th, designed Glenwood's limestone-clad building in collaboration with Steven B. Jacobs Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Glenwood's entry into the superluxury condo business follows record high prices for large apartments in new condominiums both in Midtown and Downtown. The surge is pushing developers to focus on building larger apartments that have a special appeal to affluent families and international buyers. It is also making land too expensive for many rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are now two apartments in contract for $90 million or more at One57 and a third at another Midtown tower, 432 Park Ave. A penthouse at the top of 56 Leonard St. in TriBeCa is in contract for $47 million, brokers say. The number of listings is at a record low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This premium for large apartments has led to a redesign at another taller Upper East Side development -- the Charles on First Avenue near East 73rd Street -- that is due to come on the market this summer: Now all apartments will have at least three bedrooms and a large glass walled living room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">BlueRock Real Estate</span> began foundation work on the 34-story Charles condominium tower with 51 apartments in 2008. But when the developer resumed work on the project earlier this year, the building was reconfigured to have only 30 larger apartments. Victor Homes is overseeing the development of the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the outside, the cantilevered glass building with a limestone base designed by Ismael Leyva in 2008 is little changed. But inside, the number of floors was reduced to make room for a double-height lobby and higher ceiling heights in apartments. David Collins designed the new interior spaces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both the Charles and Glenwood buildings will have no more than one apartment per floor, with elevators opening directly into all apartments, brokers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At the high end of the residential market on the Upper East Side there has been very little inventory and the demand has been increasing exponentially every single day," said Wendy Maitland, a senior managing director at Town Residential, which is marketing the Charles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Glenwood, founded by Mr. Litwin's father, put up a 17-story white-brick rental building, the Pavilion on East 77th Street in the early 1960s, and has been expanding its Manhattan portfolio ever since. It now manages 2,200 apartments on the Upper East Side alone, and is currently developing two large rental buildings on Amsterdam Avenue in the West 60s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Glenwood, like many old-line New York developers, preferred the stability and tax advantages of long-term rental-income streams to the up-and-downs of the condo market, brokers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But over the years, especially at a time of rising apartment prices, rental building owners moved on to the sales market with new projects or converting existing buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Rudin family owns a large portfolio of rental buildings, but is now working on condo developments on sites that were once part of the now-closed St. Vincent's Hospital in Greenwich Village.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Related Cos., the developer of the Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle, specialized in rentals in the 1980s, but moved on to condos during the 1990s, a company spokeswoman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Litwin resisted waves of co-op and condominium conversions over the years. The new building at 60 E. 86th St. will be the first Manhattan condo developed by the Glenwood team, though Mr. Litwin did do a large ground-up co-op on East End Avenue and East 86th Street 40 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Details of the new Glenwood building surfaced after two small buildings -- a 30-foot-wide townhouse and a 21-foot-wide walk-up next door -- were sold in March to a limited-liability company based at Glenwood Management's office in New Hyde Park, on Long Island for a total of $31 million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, the limited-liability company filed a building permit application seeking to build a 19-story building that included 13 full-floor apartments and two triplex units. That was shortly after the company received permission from the state attorney general's office to test market a condo at that address.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The condo application lists Mr. Litwin as the sponsor, along with two grandsons, Charles and Howard Swarzman, and two Glenwood executives, Gary Jacob and Charles Dorego.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked about the filing, Howard Swarzman said in a statement: "We are extremely pleased to continue our family's legacy of bringing residences of great integrity and quality to the market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are confident we will exceed all condominium expectations," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The townhouse was sold by <span class="companylink">Columbia University</span> and had previously been the home to a research institute. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, it housed the office of Dr. Kenneth B. Clark, a psychologist and civil-rights advocate who studied the harmful effects of segregation on school children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the price paid works out to about $593 a square foot, which made it too expensive for a rental development, even at the upper reaches of the market, several developers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beth Fisher, the senior managing director at Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group who is working on the 86th Street development said that while the "market was incredibly strong," the Glenwood executives decided to price the apartments "very realistically."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices will likely start at $7 million and go up to around $20 million, she said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The portion of households in the city of Washington, D.C., without access to a car in 1960 was 47%. A U.S. News article on Tuesday about cities' parking rules incorrectly put the number at 25%, which was the figure for the metro area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(WSJ July 10, 2013)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Washington, D.C., is considering waiving requirements that new buildings near its 40 rail-transit stops include parking spaces, joining a growing list of cities that are responding to shrinking car ownership by residents of dense neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">District of Columbia planners intend to present the proposal to the city's Zoning Commission in late July as part of the first comprehensive overhaul of the city's zoning in more than 50 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The changes would allow developers to determine how much parking, if any, is needed for projects in the District's downtown and within a one-quarter-mile radius of any of its Metro stops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a profound shift that several other U.S. cities have made in recent years. In 2010, Denver reduced its parking requirements near light-rail stops. Last year, Philadelphia did the same for residential projects downtown. Los Angeles last month waived parking minimums around certain transit stops. New York City in May reduced its maximum allotments of parking for residential projects in downtown Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Urban planners, who have pushed for years for cities to become less car-dependent, say such rules will encourage more residents to embrace mass transit, biking and walking. They also argue that freeing developers of the steep cost of parking can help reduce real-estate prices and rent levels in some cases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without mandated parking ratios, "the price of parking would be higher, and that higher price would induce some households to find mobility options in which they own fewer -- or no -- cars," said Richard Willson, a professor of urban planning at California State Polytechnic University in Pomona.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet some question whether that goal is realistic. Nancy MacWood, chairwoman of the Committee of 100, a citizen-planning organization that monitors District of Columbia zoning proposals, said the goal of waiving minimum parking requirements "is to try to . . . convince new residents that they don't need a car. But there isn't much comfort that this is actually going to be the result."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even Portland, Ore., a pioneer that started waiving some minimum-parking requirements in the 1980s, recently backtracked due to a scarcity of parking spots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A study conducted by Portland planners last year found that 70% of residents in eight big apartment complexes near various Portland rail stops owned at least one car. Many use light-rail, buses or bikes for their commutes, but keep a car for occasional trips.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, Portland reintroduced minimum parking requirements for new residential buildings of 30 units or more near rail stops and some other areas with mixed-use or multifamily zoning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The District of Columbia Zoning Commission in previous hearings has favored reducing parking requirements where conditions allow it. Harriet Tregoning, director of the city's Office of Planning, said that scaling back requirements near Metro stops is overdue. The city already is one of the least car-dependent in the U.S., thanks in part to the 37-year-old rail system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1960, before Metro's arrival, roughly 25% of Washington households had no car, according to census data. By 2000, the carless rate had risen to 37%. By 2011, it was almost 39%. That puts Washington at one of the highest carless rates in the country. In comparison, Dallas posted a 7.6% carless rate in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Washington planners can look to the Columbia Heights neighborhood for a costly reminder of the city's previous parking requirements missing the mark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, the District spent $47 million to build a 1,000-space parking garage under the new DC USA multilevel shopping center. The city's zoning code mandated four parking spots for every 1,000 square feet of commercial space. But the developer, Grid Properties, persuaded city officials to cut the required total by nearly half.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, those 1,000 spaces turned out to be more than needed, because many shoppers ride the Metro to the mall. The garage languished more than half empty until the city courted nearby businesses to let employees park there. "That really hurt, to pay for a parking garage that was hardly used," Ms. Tregoning said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Grid Properties Principal Drew Greenwald said the solution is to scale back minimum-parking requirements rather than eliminate them. "You can't leave it totally to the private market because one guy will decide not to build parking, thinking the next guy is going to do it," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For residential projects, Washington requires developers to provide from one-quarter to one parking space per unit, depending on the zoning. That, too, will be waived for projects near Metro stops if the changes are approved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But residents of some Washington neighborhoods worry that their streets will become parking lots for commuters taking the Metro downtown. Meg Maguire, a 70-year-old community conservationist, has lived in Capitol Hill a few blocks from two Metro stops since 1977. She suspects that developers won't build much parking under the proposed changes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Capitol Hill, most homes lack garages, so residents park on the street. Any additional cars make parking room scarcer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're having to do more and more parking several blocks away" from the house, Ms. Maguire said. "That's a little disconcerting at night when you're alone."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deadly weekend explosion of a runaway crude-carrying train in Quebec threatens to ratchet up scrutiny of rising crude-by-rail shipments on both sides of the U.S.-Canada border, amid a boom in North American oil production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In both countries, shipments of crude by rail have shot up sharply, as producers race to get all their new oil to market and as pipeline companies scramble to build new lines or reconfigure old ones to handle the growing volumes. Meanwhile, uncertainty over several big pipeline projects -- including approval delays for <span class="companylink">TransCanada Corp</span>.'s Keystone XL, which would connect Western Canada's booming oil sands development to the Gulf Coast -- have sent some oil companies looking to rail as a longer-term solution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian authorities have confirmed five deaths and estimate some 40 people are still missing after a runaway train carrying crude derailed early Saturday and exploded, demolishing a large swath of Lac Megantic, Quebec, including as many as 30 incinerated buildings. Investigators, citing the high death toll, have opened a criminal investigation. Canadian regulators have said they are concentrating their probe initially on the train, its braking system and the track.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S., shipments of crude by rail have gone from 9,500 carloads in 2008, the year widely seen as the beginning of the current oil boom, to 233,811 carloads in 2012, according to the <span class="companylink">Association of American Railroads</span>. A carload is typically about 740 barrels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 16.6 million barrels of Canadian crude were shipped by rail to the U.S. in 2012, accounting for about 2% of Canadian crude exports, according to data from <span class="companylink">Canada's National Energy Board</span>. But industry estimates say that could grow to as much as 73 million barrels in 2013 and nearly 110 million barrels by 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada, in particular, has been hit by a recent spate of high-profile accidents involving trains -- several, but not all, of which have been carrying petroleum. Last month, a <span class="companylink">Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd</span>. freight train carrying petroleum diluent derailed on a failing rail bridge amid record flooding in Calgary, Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That accident was the fifth derailment of a CP train in three months. The city's mayor publicly questioned whether the company, which is responsible for its own track and bridge inspections, put profits ahead of safety. CP officials denied cutting corners on inspections and said the derailments aren't connected to any underlying trend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the accident early Saturday is on a whole different scale. The train's operator, <span class="companylink">Montreal Maine &amp; Atlantic Railway Inc</span>., a unit of privately held U.S. railroad operator <span class="companylink">Rail World Inc</span>., said the runaway train was loaded with 72 carloads of crude bound from North Dakota to a refinery in New Brunswick.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It had been stopped during a crew rest outside town. The company said it inexplicably started to roll, unmanned, about 7 miles until derailing in Lac Megantic. The town has a population of about 6,000 and is some 22 miles from the U.S. border with Maine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement late Sunday, <span class="companylink">MM&amp;A</span> said an engineer inspected the train and ensured one of its locomotives was running and that its air brake was engaged. It said subsequent to that inspection, the locomotive was shut down, which may have released the brake. It didn't provide details but said it was cooperating with investigators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rail accidents, particular large derailments involving fatalities and spills, are relatively rare. The North American rail industry's safety record has improved in recent decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the number of incidents involving crude shipments has surged along with growth in North American oil production. Industry executives say the number of spills is still tiny compared with the amount of crude shipped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In the past decade, 95% of rail incidents involving crude oil were. . .nonaccident releases, and 70% of those incidents involved spills of less than 5 gallons," said Holly Arthur, a spokeswoman for the <span class="companylink">Association of American Railroads</span>. The <span class="companylink">Railway Association of Canada</span> said 99.9977% of all products shipped on the country's railroads arrive safely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most recent rail accidents involving crude have been small -- such as the three gallons of oil that spilled from three derailed tanker cars in central Maine on their way to the same refinery in New Brunswick in March. But others, like the latest accident and a 357-barrel spill in Minnesota involving another CP train on its way to Chicago, have been more significant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crude shipments first started to make a noticeable difference to <span class="companylink">BNSF Railway Co</span>., one big crude shipper, in 2008. At the time, it moved about 1.3 million barrels. In 2012 BNSF moved about 90 million barrels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Canada, CP hauled 53,500 carloads of crude last year, up from 13,000 in 2012 and just 500 in 2009. Meanwhile, Montreal-based <span class="companylink">Canadian National Railway Co</span>. expects to double last year's 30,000 crude oil carloads this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traditionally, railroads are less attractive to oil companies because of higher shipping costs compared with pipelines. But the rapid development of new oil fields, from West Canada through North Dakota and into West Texas in the past five years, has production outpacing pipeline construction, leading many producers and refiners to turn to rail, initially as a temporary fix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But once seen as a temporary solution until new, permanent pipelines could be built, rail usage has proved to be so effective that many refiners have come to prefer the railroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though pipelines are generally less expensive and less prone to leaks and spills, rail offers refiners the ability to bring in crude from different locations at different prices, instead of being stuck with a single source of oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, at least two pipeline projects -- one to transport crude from North Dakota's Bakken shale to a storage hub in Oklahoma, and one to move West Texas oil to California -- have been interrupted due to lack of interest from refiners already accessing rail shipments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Maine, crude has increasingly been shipped from Canada and the U.S. Midwest to an <span class="companylink">Irving Oil Ltd</span>. refinery in Saint John, New Brunswick, raising worry there. Maine has seen crude by rail shipments soar in the past two years from 14,300 barrels in January 2012 to 1.1 million barrels in December, most of it from Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crude involved in this weekend's derailment and explosion in Lac Megantic was scheduled to traverse Maine on its way to the Irving Oil refinery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increased Canadian crude traffic has Maine spill-response officials working with railroads to find locations to stage spill cleanup equipment, and has led environmental groups to organize protests and lobby state lawmakers for restrictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, six people were arrested in Fairfield, Maine, when they tried to block a train carrying crude bound from Canada to Saint John.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Land-hungry New York City developers have been creating enormously valuable property out of thin air for more than a century by building concrete platforms over rusty rail yards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Related Cos., with the help of media behemoth <span class="companylink">Time Warner Inc</span>., is poised to take this classic form of real-estate alchemy to a new level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developer is on the verge of a two-pronged deal in which <span class="companylink">Time Warner</span> would move to a planned 80-story new headquarters atop a platform Related would build over a rail yard on the far West Side. At the same time, Related would buy the <span class="companylink">Time Warner Center</span>, the company's decade-old world existing headquarters at Columbus Circle, for more than $1.3 billion, according to people familiar with the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a tentative agreement is signed, it would be a game-changer for the sprawling rail yard that has been recognized for decades as one of Manhattan's great undeveloped sites. The relocation of a prestigious company like <span class="companylink">Time Warner</span> there would provide an enormous boost to Related's $15 billion Hudson Yards plan to develop a 13.4 million-square-foot megaproject on 26 acres.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of it would be built on two massive podiums above acres of tracks. "We're constructing a new city-within-a-city to hand over to our children," says Jim White, an engineer and 30-year construction veteran who is overseeing the building of the platform for Related.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, it will likely take years -- perhaps even decades -- before Related can claim unqualified success. The developer will have to ride out the ups and downs of future economic cycles, adjust to fast-changing technology, surmount daunting construction hurdles and face multiple other challenges to make its vision a reality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But its reclamation technique has been well-tested. Minting land on vast platforms over active rail lines in a city where it is bewitchingly scarce is a venerable Manhattan tradition: Starting in 1902, some of the world's most treasured real estate was conjured up out of cinders and soot when the New York Central Railroad submerged its tracks and yards, capped them with a steel deck and spurred the development of Park Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Ride into Grand Central and what you see -- columns rising from below with a hard deck above and buildings and roads and open spaces above that -- is remarkably similar to what we're doing at Hudson Yards," said Ron Wackrow, 66 years old, the Related executive vice president overseeing all design and construction at Hudson Yards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, the esoteric art of platform design also figures in other New York developments. Forest City Ratner is eventually planning to build a large platform next to its Barclays Center project, on top of which the master plan calls for six residential towers and open space. One block east of Hudson Yards, <span class="companylink">Brookfield Office Properties Inc</span>. broke ground in January on its $4.5 billion Manhattan West office development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long backed by the Bloomberg administration, the covering of the West Side rail yards could reshape the western end of Midtown just as the burying of the rails north of Grand Central Terminal fueled a boom in Midtown East. Related's project calls for a forest of four residential and commercial towers, including <span class="companylink">Time Warner</span>'s prospective site to the north and an office building now under way on West 30th Street anchored by <span class="companylink">Coach Inc</span>. A public plaza and five-story luxury shopping mall connecting the two office towers will also sit on the podium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Covering Park Avenue moved the central business district from downtown to Midtown. Now, this could expand it into far westward territory," says Alexander Garvin, the urban planner who proposed capping the yards in 1996 and worked on the city's unsuccessful bid for the 2012 Olympic Games.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first platform at the heart of Related's plans -- between 10th and 11th avenues -- would cost roughly $750 million and take more than two years to complete. It must be built, gingerly, inside a sprawling rail yard with 30 tracks on an upper level, where the LIRR parks and maintains its trains, and three tunnels on a lower level, through which Amtrak and NJ Transit ferry its passengers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anchored in bedrock and serving as the foundation for the buildings above, which range from 600 to 1,300 feet in height, the deck will rest on 300 caissons, which are watertight, vertical retaining supports, with about 200 of them interspersed among the tracks. The caissons weigh between 4 and 60 tons and will be sunk to depths up to 80 feet below the rails.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The underbelly of the platform, the lower sections of its structural trusses, will be about 20 feet above the tracks, Related says. All three railroads say they're closely monitoring design and construction to avoid train interference and ensure safe operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To pinpoint the exact location of railroad infrastructure and utilities, Related began drilling exploratory pits in the railbed in May. It starts relocating utilities later this month, a five-month task, then undertakes the delicate, 14-month installation of caissons in January, riding the rails with specially engineered equipment to drill through soil and rock.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anya Martin   </div><div>824 words</div><div>5 July 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the real-estate market rebounds, many luxury homeowners who just a few years ago had their heads underwater are now only ankle deep.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of the first quarter, 20.6% of homes with jumbo mortgages were underwater, meaning the owners owed more on the mortgage than the home was worth. That's compared with 32.3% a year ago, according to real-estate website <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More important, the level of negative equity has improved significantly for homeowners, said Stan Humphries, chief economist for Zillow. "Nationally most people in negative equity are in relatively shallow water, with less than 20% negative equity," he said, meaning that borrowers' loan-to-value percentage is less than 120%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Zillow analysis includes homes that have one jumbo mortgage and whose unpaid balance is still at a jumbo level, above the threshold for government-backed loans of $417,000 in most areas of the country and $625,500 in certain high-price home markets, such as New York, San Francisco and Boston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strengthening economy and housing market have boosted the value of high-end homes, which has translated to fewer homeowners underwater. As a result, more borrowers with jumbo mortgages will be eligible to refinance their loans at a time when interest rates are still historically low and the availability of jumbos is improving. As of June 21, the interest rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate jumbo was 4.52%, just 0.06 percentage point above the 4.46% rate for a 30-year fixed-rate conforming loan, which falls under the threshold for jumbo loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In five major metro areas, fewer than 10% of jumbo-loan borrowers owe more than their homes are worth. Those cities are San Jose, Calif., with just 5.8%; Boston, with 6.3%; Denver, with 6.6%; Dallas-Fort Worth, with 7.6%; and San Francisco, at 9.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Generally the California Sunbelt markets have seen the strongest recoveries, fueled by massive resets in affordability and very strong demographics coming from mainstream buyers, second-home buyers, retirees and a lot of international buyers," Mr. Humphries said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tight inventory and bidding wars are driving up home values rapidly in Silicon Valley and the San Francisco Bay area, and so far appraisals have been keeping pace, said Franco Terango, Pacific sales executive for <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beth Dickerson, an agent with Gibson/Back Bay Sotheby's International Realty, is seeing no mortgages underwater in the downtown Boston neighborhoods where she primarily works, such as Back Bay, Beacon Hill and South End, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the New York metro area, 14.5% of homes with jumbo mortgages are currently in negative equity, according to Zillow, but home values in Manhattan appear to have stabilized back to normal levels, said David Adamo, CEO of Luxury Mortgage, a lender based in Stamford, Conn. "Jumbo refinancing is back to business as usual," he added. "We're doing them all day, every day."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jumbo loans themselves have become scarce in Las Vegas because of the steep drop in home values, but reduced prices can be a boon for luxury home buyers, said Casey Moseman, a broker with All Western Mortgage, based in Las Vegas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typically the only relief for a borrower with an underwater home value is a loan modification. Some lenders, though, are now offering refinance plans for their own underwater borrowers. For example, in late May, <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> rolled out a refinance program for its borrowers at near-market interest rates that would cover a home with up to a 200% loan-to-value percentage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To qualify, borrowers still must have an excellent credit history, said Brad Blackwell, executive vice president, portfolio business manager at <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo Home Mortgage</span>. "These programs are for customers who are doing just fine, but just had the unfortunate circumstance of buying a house at the peak of the market," he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some more considerations if your jumbo loan is underwater:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Time to take another look. Homeowners whose jumbo loans were in negative equity within the past few years may be pleasantly surprised to find out their values are no longer underwater or are significantly less so, Mr. Terango said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Cash in to qualify. With interest rates low, jumbo borrowers whose homes aren't significantly underwater may wish to put down cash to lower their loan amount, Mr. Adamo said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Policy changes. With the mortgage crisis abating, the federal government may lower conforming-loan limits, meaning that more underwater homeowners' only refinance option will be a jumbo mortgage, Mr. Humphries said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Don't forget credit scores. A negative hit to a credit score can affect the ability to qualify for a new mortgage or refinance later. Before agreeing to a modification, borrowers should ask lenders if they will report as having paid "less than agreed," Ms. Moseman said.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">REIT Outlook Positive Despite Recent Fall --- Analysts See Overreaction as Investors Dumped Stocks Last Quarter on Interest-Rate Worries; Some 'Soul Searching'</span>
</div><div class="author">By A.D. Pruitt </div><div>838 words</div><div>3 July 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate investment trust stocks had their worst quarter in nearly two years, as investors worried that rising interest rates could derail the commercial real-estate recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big question now is: What's next?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If rates climb even higher, REITs will have to pay more to borrow money, and their dividends will look less attractive to investors compared with the other high-yielding investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some analysts believe that REIT investors may have overreacted to rising interest rates by dumping the stocks. Indeed, they point out, since June 24, REITs have outperformed the broader market as investors have returned to the sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most analysts still believe REITs will return 11% to 15% this year, including dividends and stock gains, because the economy will keep expanding, though not fast enough to trigger a spike in interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We still think the REITs are attractive in that environment," said Jeung Hyun, a portfolio manager at <span class="companylink">Adelante Capital Management</span>,</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Equity All REIT Index, which tracks 141 real-estate investment trusts, delivered a total return, including dividends, of negative 2% for the second quarter. That was the weakest performance since the third quarter of 2011 and marked a staggering about-face from the first quarter of this year, when REITs posted a gain of 7.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said REITs were set on a downward spiral in mid-May after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke signaled that the U.S. central bank would phase out its quantitative-easing program as early as the end of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was a quarter for soul searching among REIT investors as the Fed comments filtered through the market," said Paul Adornato, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets. He said that investors are scrutinizing individual companies very closely to determine which ones should continue to prosper even if interest rates rise. "Now is the time when investors really need to pay attention to operating fundamentals," Mr. Adornato said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conditions improved, though, in recent days. The sector has outperformed broader equities since June 24, rising 5.8% as the rate panic started to subside. The broader market rose 2.68% during that same period, as measured by the Standard &amp; Poor's 500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs, which pay out hefty dividends, have been especially attractive to small investors because they typically carry higher yields than other types of investments. The average REIT dividend yield is about 3.4%, according the Dow Jones REIT index, compared with an average of 2% for the stocks that make up the Standard &amp; Poor's 500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low interest rates allowed commercial landlords to raise cheap capital to repay debt, pad war chests for acquisitions and in a few cases develop new properties, which boosted earnings. That could reverse if interest rates rise too high. "Investors' greatest fear is that borrowing costs will rise so significantly in the near term that it would cause a serious dent in REIT earnings," said Jay Leupp, a managing director at <span class="companylink">Lazard Asset Management</span>, of the rate concerns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly all REIT categories posted negative results in the second quarter, but mortgage REITs, which use short-term debt to buy longer-term mortgage securities, were pummeled with a total return of negative 18%. Mortgage REITs are at the greatest risk if interest rates rise because that would increase their short-term borrowing costs and cut the value of their mortgage-bond holdings, possibly resulting in losses and reduced dividends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of the concern in the quarter was for the book values" of mortgage REITs, said Jason Arnold, an analyst at <span class="companylink">RBC Capital Markets</span>. He added that despite the spike on longer-term rates in recent weeks, mortgage REITs remain profitable given that short-term rates are still low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Multifamily and self-storage landlords were the only main sectors that posted gains, in part because investors assume they are best-positioned to produce rent growth even in an environment of rising interest rates. Multifamily REITs delivered a total return of 3.5% in the second quarter, while self-storage posted a 2.34% return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think apartments and self-storage will be the leaders in rent growth over the next 12 months," Mr. Leupp said. He added that lease terms for apartments range from six to nine months and self-storage companies usually lease monthly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Multifamily REITs had lagged behind the sector in the previous quarter amid concerns that the improving single-family home market might result in lower rents and higher vacancies at apartment buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, if longer-term rates continue to move higher, that could damp new-home purchases and increase demand for apartments, analysts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other sectors posting declines include health-care REITs, which generated a total return of negative 4.4%, and strip mall companies, which declined 3.6%. Office REITs edged down 0.91%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Austin Kilham</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The husband and wife, both 60, had bought a $2 million vacation home in Colorado after the market bottomed in 2008. The home was a foreclosure, and the couple was able to buy the property for less than market value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in early 2012 the couple saw signs of recovery in the Colorado real-estate market and turned to their adviser, John K. Howk, for help. They were concerned about a potential increase in the estate-tax rate, as well as the rebounding value of their home. They wanted to gift the house to their children as soon as possible to minimize gift taxes--but they also wanted to retain the right to use the home for several more years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This client was focused on avoiding estate tax to the nth degree," says Mr. Howk, senior vice president of the Client Advisor Group at the Private Bank at <span class="companylink">BOK Financial</span> in Tulsa, Okla., which manages $50.4 billion for 3,000 clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Complicating matters, the couple planned on making use of their lifetime gift-tax exemption for future gifts. So Mr. Howk suggested that the clients use a qualified personal residence trust (QPRT) to gift the home. Under this plan, the couple would owe gift taxes on the depressed value of the home, but the trust allowed any future appreciation of the home to be passed tax free to the children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the couple wanted to continue using the home, Mr. Howk suggested they set the term of the trust for 10 years. The couple could use the home during the term, and then transfer it to their children when it ended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, <span class="companylink">Internal Revenue Service</span> rules required the couple to subtract the value of the home's use from its current value. Using an IRS formula, the couple and their adviser calculated the use value to be $300,000 for a decade of use, which they subtracted from the $2 million value of the home. The result: The couple paid about $510,000 in gift taxes on the remaining $1.7 million value of the home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of the 10-year term, the house will be transferred at its appreciated value to the children with no additional taxes. Based on housing market trends in the area, the couple estimated that the house would appreciate at 7% per year--meaning its value could increase to $3.9 million at the end of the term. Were that to happen, locking in the value of the house at $1.7 million would save the couple more than $780,000 in gift taxes, says Mr. Howk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the solution worked well for his clients, Mr. Howk notes a QPRT isn't a perfect fit for everyone. Clients should live in an area where real-estate prices are likely to see a lot of appreciation. Age is also a factor, because if the client dies before the end of a trust's term, the property passes immediately to the beneficiaries, which can reduce the amount of time to build value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Mr. Howk's clients are young enough that surviving the 10-year term is less of concern for them, he says. "This was the perfect solution," says Mr. Howk. "Not only could the clients give a generous gift, but they were able to do so at the distressed price so all future appreciation will go to the children."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fern Hammond is a real-estate broker who represented a buyer in a bidding war on an Upper East Side studio. A Property article on Tuesday incorrectly gave her first name as Fran.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(WSJ July 3, 2013)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan has become a real-estate battle zone for buyers like Jesse Damon fighting over an ever-shrinking supply of apartments, brokers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Damon, an immigration lawyer and his wife, Mari, found that to be true when they tried to acquire a family-size, two-bedroom apartment on the West Side after paying huge sums to rent in the same neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite a budget of up to $2 million, every place that they wanted also attracted other bidders willing to pay more, almost as soon at the listing came on the market. They had lost several bidding wars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So when the Damons found a co-op apartment they loved on West 81st Street, they sent the sellers a note introducing themselves and enclosed a family photo, along with their bid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's frustrating," Mr. Damon said. "Everybody is trying to get the same thing, there is a lot of competition."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers have many similar stories to tell about deals won and lost by buyers in the Manhattan market for everything from studios to multimillion-dollar units as the number of listings has shrunk. Listings during the second quarter -- the peak selling season in Manhattan -- reach their lowest point on record according to Jonathan Miller of appraisal firm Miller Samuel Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A market report by <span class="companylink">Corcoran Group</span> being released Tuesday found that there were 4,450 contracts for Manhattan apartments signed during the second quarter, the most, by far, in any quarter since the second period of 2007 and 18% above the second quarter in 2012. The same report found that closed sales were up 4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pamela Liebman, president of Corcoran, said that 72% of her firm's brokers who responded to a survey said they had been involved in a bidding war this year, and about half of those said they were part of multiple bidding wars. A year earlier, 50% said they had been involved in bidding wars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"From the seller's point of view, it is a very exciting market," said Sophie Ravet, a broker at the TriBeCa office of Brown Harris Stevens. She said that all seven exclusive listings she put on the market this year ended in bidding wars within two weeks after they were listed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said that prices were increasing downtown, and that some buyers who couldn't afford to pay all cash have "decided to take a breather" and drop out of the market. They were waiting for a market correction or a rise in listings, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, The Wall Street Journal reported that median prices and closed sales in Manhattan during the second quarter were nearly flat compared with a year earlier, based on an analysis of closed records, and a number of latest market reports from brokerage firms being released Tuesday had similar findings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One report by Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead, for example, reported that sales were off by 1% from the year-earlier period and median prices were unchanged at $850,000. It found that the average price was off 3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But another report prepared by Mr. Miller for <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> had a more upbeat picture. Unlike the methodology for other reports, Mr. Miller includes nonpublic data on deals reported to be close that weren't yet officially filed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Elliman report found that all price indicators for Manhattan were up from the same quarter last year, with median prices up 4.3% to $865,000. It put the average price at $1.425 million, an increase of 1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For co-ops, the median price was $665,000, and the average price was $1.09 million. For condos, the median price was $1.25 million and the average price was $1.89 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dottie Herman, president of Douglas Elliman, said that the market was "hot" and that was likely to continue over the next year. She said the tabulations don't include especially strong sales in new developments, like 56 Leonard St. in TriBeCa and 150 Charles St. in the West Village.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As quickly as developers put up listings for their new developments "they are gone," she said. While asking prices on new developments are rising faster than those on older buildings, Ms. Herman said they were still being snapped up. "It is like they are giving them away," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Diane Ramirez, chief executive officer of Halstead Property, said that the market was strong and stable and buyers were cautious. Overall, she said, "Prices are not skyrocketing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Nanjoo Joung, an interior designer, found the market frenzied when she bid on a large studio with an alcove on York Avenue on the Upper East Side in need of renovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Working with Fern Hammond, a friend and broker at Halstead Property, she experienced a moment of elation when she outbid another buyer and made a deal on the apartment listed at $359,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when the seller didn't send a contract, she and the broker became worried.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They were then told there were two higher offers, for all cash, without a mortgage contingency. So Ms. Joung raised her offer and found private financing to be able to close without a mortgage. She got the apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They were looking for the highest bid they could get and in this market they can get it," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for Mr. Damon, on the advice of his broker, Scott Stewart of Corcoran, he prepared a one-page personal statement introducing his family, including his 5-year-old daughter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We explained who we were and why we wanted the apartment and what our plans were for the next few years," he said. "It was our life story."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment at 15 West 81st St. had high ceilings and big rooms, and it was the one they liked best.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stewart said that when multiple bidders are offering about the same price, a personal note or a photo can help clinch the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that isn't what happened to the Damons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They bid more than $2 million, significantly more than the asking price. The seller appreciated the letter, but someone else bid even more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The response was, we really like you guys a lot, but there was a significant spread between your bid and someone else's," Mr. Damon said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real-estate rebound is fueling stronger construction spending. Total spending on U.S. construction projects rose 0.5% in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $874.9 billion. The May reading, which was driven by residential construction, is the highest level since September 2009. But it remains well below the prerecession average of around $1.2 trillion in 2006 and 2007.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Josh Mitchell   </div><div>341 words</div><div>1 July 2013</div><div>10:12</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Spending on construction projects in the U.S. rose to the highest level in more than 3½ years in May, reflecting a pickup in home building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total U.S. construction spending[http://www.census.gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/construction/c30/c30index.html] rose by 0.5% in May from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $874.9 billion, the Commerce Department said Monday. That was the highest level since September 2009. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast a 0.6% increase in construction spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise was driven by residential construction, which rose 1.2% from a month earlier and 22.7% from a year ago. Private residential construction, which excludes public housing, rose to the highest level since October 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meantime, spending on construction of public buildings—including, state, local and federal government structures—rose 1.8% in May from April, but was down 4.7% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report offered the latest signs that the recovery of the housing market is helping the economy to weather cuts in public spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are signs that construction could pick up further in coming months, given strength in the housing market. The government reported last month that apartment construction increased in May, and that home builders had lined up permits to ramp up construction of single-family homes. One reason residential construction is increasing is that the inventory of homes is low, while demand rises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction spending is still low by historical standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction spending surged in the middle of the last decade during the housing boom, at one point exceeding an annual rate of $1 trillion. Spending fell sharply after the housing crash and through the recession, falling below a $750 billion pace in early 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While residential construction spending picked up last month, other types of private construction slipped. The data showed private nonresidential construction—which includes spending on offices, manufacturing and transportation—fell by 1.4% in May.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is getting hot -- and that is changing the game for both home buyers and sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many cities, including those hard hit by the downturn, bidding wars are breaking out and winning offers often exceed the asking price. A relatively low inventory of homes for sale is feeding the scramble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales were up 13% in May compared with the previous year, reports the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>, and the median home price was up 15%, to $208,000, the biggest jump since October 2005. Average home prices for the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller 20-city index, reported Tuesday, were up 12% in April over a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For first-time buyers and those eager to move up, it could be a good time to buy. Prices still are well below the mid-2000s highs. Interest rates have shot up, but they remain low by historical standards. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage jumped 0.53 percentage point to 4.46% for the week ended Thursday, up from 3.35% in early May, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>'s weekly survey. Until 2009, rates were above 5% going back to the early 1970s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initially, rising rates could drive potential buyers into the market before mortgage costs climb more. But if rates continue upward, they could help put an end to the boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While an active market can be good for both buyers and sellers, a sizzling market poses challenges. In some areas, real-estate agents have been accused of holding back choice homes for sale from the Multiple Listing Service database so they can market them first to their own clients. Bidding wars can leave potential buyers feeling bruised and frustrated. And climbing home prices mean appraisals might come in below the agreed-on price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are some tips for navigating this evolving market:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Cash matters. It helps to have a bundle of cash to get the home you want. Down payments today range from 3.5% for a loan backed by the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span> to as much as 40% for homes over $1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A typical down payment on a regular mortgage is 5% to 10%, says Bob Walters, chief economist at Quicken Loans. Buyers who need a "jumbo" loan -- or one bigger than $417,000 or $625,500, depending where you live -- might have to put down 20% or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the lender's appraisal of the home falls short of your purchase price, the buyer and seller must negotiate whether the seller will reduce the price or the buyer will pay the difference in cash -- or some combination of the two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Get prequalified. Mortgage lenders still carefully scrutinize borrowers' ability to repay their loans, and sellers might be leery of bids that are contingent on getting financing. Potential buyers will be more attractive if they already have qualified for a loan, even in calm markets, like Connecticut, says Terence Beaty, director of the new-homes and land division at Prudential Connecticut Realty, based in Wallingford, Conn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means picking a lender and providing pay stubs, bank and brokerage statements and, for those who are self-employed, tax returns. Generally, you will need a credit score of at least 640 to get a mortgage, says Greg Gwizdz, executive vice president at <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo Home Mortgage</span>, the nation's largest residential lender -- and it will need to be higher if you want the best rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You won't be able to lock in your interest rate until you have a contract. Given that rates have been climbing, ask for a rate that can be locked in for 30 to 45 days at no additional cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Get a connected real-estate agent. Bypass your sister's old roommate and pick an agent who knows the neighborhood well. That person should know about homes about to come on the market or for sale but not in the database (sometimes called "pocket" listings), so you can see them early on. Whether you are a buyer or seller, you want an agent who keeps track of the most recent sales, which could help an appraiser justify the price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ask the agent what improvements the house needs to be consistent with what is selling. Older properties might languish without updates and repairs. Today's buyers come from "the HGTV generation" and don't expect to do the work themselves, says Dorcas Helfant-Browning, co-owner of Coldwell Banker Professional, Realtors, with seven offices in Virginia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Prepare for auction. Jason Glast, an agent at Keller Williams Luxury International in San Antonio, recommends that selling clients who get multiple bids reject all the offers and then ask each bidder to submit a "final and best offer" by a specific deadline, so the bids can be compared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jessica Edwards, who is <span class="companylink">Coldwell Banker Real Estate</span>'s consumer specialist and is based in Wilmington, N.C., recommends buyers who are competing for a house forgo a low initial bid and instead make their best offer. "You may only get one shot," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers should offer their best terms as well as price, including any contingencies, when they plan to close, whether they are prequalified for a loan and how much escrow money they are willing to fork over to secure the deal. Sellers might choose a lower price in favor of a buyer who appears more serious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Glast of San Antonio adds one other thing: Playing off the emotion wrapped up in the process, he often pens a letter to the sellers explaining why his clients are the perfect buyers for their house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a bit of a dating ritual to this," he says.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anya Martin   </div><div>782 words</div><div>27 June 2013</div><div>22:06</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Want to live in a geodesic home or a reproduction of a medieval castle? Jumbo borrowers shopping for offbeat homes may face challenges in getting a mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kristi Gillis and her husband, Bill Hollars, bought a geodesic home in Montera, Calif., for $700,000 last fall. The couple was preapproved by a major bank for a jumbo mortgage, but when they told their lender they planned to buy the domed home, the bank withdrew the financing. Every lender they contacted refused to discuss a loan because of the house's unusual shape. "What was upsetting is that we thought we'd done everything right," Ms. Gillis said. "We both were pretty shocked, and even the agents involved were surprised."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually, though, their San Mateo, Calif.-based mortgage broker Premiere Lender found two banks that would issue loans, Mr. Hollars said. One wanted a steep upfront commitment: a 20% down payment and an additional 15% of the loan amount in a reserve account. Fortunately, the other bank approved a loan with a 10% down payment and a 3.25% 30-year fixed rate <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span>-backed mortgage. (The hefty down payment put their loan amount below the jumbo threshold, defined as $417,000 in most markets and reaching up to $729,500 for FHA-backed loans in high-price areas.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many lenders are skittish about offbeat homes, since a unique design or unusual amenities make it hard to assess its market value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"An artsy person who lives outside the box will look at one house and think it's stunning," she added. "When an appraiser looks at it, it's about what's the norm for the area," said Karen J. Mann, a Discovery Bay, Calif.-based appraiser who covers the San Francisco, Silicon Valley and Sacramento communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jumbo loans already require more scrutiny and sometimes even two appraisals, said Mike McPartland, head of investment finance, North America, Citi Private Bank. "When evaluating collateral, [lenders] want to make sure the value is as close to the market as it can be," he added. The reason is simple. If a borrower defaults on the loan, the lender needs to ensure they can recapture its value in foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jumbo borrowers already can expect to pay a down payment of 20% to 45% of the home's purchase price, with the percentage rising with loan amounts. If a property's appraised value comes under loan amount, the lender will require a higher percentage upfront, said Mathew Carson, a mortgage broker at <span class="companylink">First Capital Group Inc</span>. in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mantra "location, location, location" may be the biggest factor in whether borrowers need to come up with more cash for a house with one-of-a-kind features. For example, in Boston, buyer tastes tend to be somewhat conservative, so a home with a high-maintenance indoor pool may be more likely to affect an appraisal adversely, said Lorrie Beaumont, president of Westwood, Mass.-based LB Appraisal Associates, which serves the Boston area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conversely, in California's Silicon Valley, customized luxury homes are ubiquitous, since technology executives like to show off their success in their home design, said Ms. Mann, the Discovery Bay, Calif., appraiser. "Once people feel like they have made it, they want a home to fit their personality and their lifestyle," she added. "It shows they have made it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To appraise homes in these areas, Ms. Mann will provide up to 15 comparable home sales to demonstrate the wide range of offerings in the marketplace. These aren't hard to find in what is currently a hot real-estate market. Occasionally, if a home is really expensive and unique, such as a 40,000-square-foot mansion built in 1931 that she appraised in the 1990s, she has extended the comparables area to the entire West Coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The current owner also owned a castle in England and another property in another country," Ms. Mann said. "The market was clearly for a world-class owner with an eccentric personality."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More considerations for mortgages or refinances of highly personalized homes:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Check on permits. More money down can compensate for quirky design, but unpermitted work will make a lender walk away from a loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Don't always settle. Time may be of the essence to clinch a deal in a tight housing market, but if seeking a refinance, consider a rebuttal of an appraisal that seems unfair, Mr. Carson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• A possible silver lining. Lenders typically offer lower interest rates when a borrower pays a higher percentage of the loan value upfront.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sharp increases in long-term interest rates, triggered by Federal Reserve statements last week, threaten sales of homes, cars and other big-ticket items that have helped drive the U.S. economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rate increases on interest-sensitive sectors likely aren't severe enough to derail the recovery, say economists. But they arrived just as the economy's lagging growth had showed welcome signs of improvement, raising worries among consumers and company executives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It causes me to be a bit more cautious," said Ron DeFeo, the chief executive of <span class="companylink">Terex Corp</span>. The Westport, Conn.-based company makes cranes, paving equipment and other heavy building machines, a business sensitive to interest rate changes. "I am hesitant because I really don't believe the U.S. economy is in a strong growth mode."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates on conventional 30-year mortgages were 4.56% on Wednesday, up from 3.74% a month ago, according to HSH Associates; rates on investment-grade-rated corporate bonds went to 3.47% from 2.73%, according to <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>; and yields on 10-year <span class="companylink">U.S. Treasury</span> notes were 2.54%, up from 1.94%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. economy grew at a 1.8% annualized rate in the first quarter this year after barely growing in the fourth quarter of 2012, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A big chunk of the growth was produced by spending on big-ticket consumer goods and home construction, both sensitive to interest rates. Taking away those two sectors, the economy grew at an anemic 0.9% in the first quarter and contracted in the final three months of 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. car and light-truck sales, for example, are on track to surpass 15 million units this year, up from a low of 10.4 million in 2009. While dealers and industry economists don't see danger yet, they worry about rising rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As we speak today the car market is generally healthy, but it's very fragile all in the same breath," said William C. Fox, who owns four new and used car dealerships in upstate New York. "We feel it very quickly if something goes wrong."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates are supposed to go up as economic growth accelerates, and their rise could represent an undercurrent of good economic news. Higher rates have benefits, such as better returns to savers. Still, Fed officials were surprised that markets pushed rates up so far so fast after their announcement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest rates had been rising since early May, but shot up sharply after Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's June 19 news conference where he said the central bank could end an $85 billion-per-month bond buying program by the middle of next year if the economy continues to improve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The program was initiated last year to hold down long-term rates and boost prices of such assets as homes and stocks. He also said the Fed would abandon its plan to wind down its bond purchases if the economy underperforms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's too early to form a judgment about the degree of the backup," Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher said in an interview Wednesday. "Markets are still sorting through the signals they are receiving."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists at <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> estimated the combination of interest rate increases and lower stock prices could shave 0.4 percentage point off U.S. growth over the next 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists at Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch estimated that a single percentage point increase in U.S. borrowing rates from 3.5% to 4.5% increased the monthly payment on a $160,000 mortgage by $80 to $100.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michelle Meyer, a Merrill economist, said housing affordability remained at historically high levels because of low rates and the drop in home prices since the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She expected demand for homes to continue, in part because of the momentum that is already developed as buyers get off the fence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think the economy will be able to handle the increase in rates," Ms. Meyer said. "We are far from the danger zone in terms of affordability."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices on the stock of home builders fell after the Fed's statements last week, reflecting concerns that rising interest rates could curtail demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Frederick N. Cooper, senior vice president of finance, international development and investor relations at Horsham, Pa.-based <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers Inc</span>., took a more optimistic view. Rates are rising, he said, because the economy is stronger and the job market is improving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Those are the really compelling things that benefit housing, and I think those far outweigh the interest rate impact, given where interest rates are today," he said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Alyssa Abkowitz </div><div>2214 words</div><div>28 June 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new log cabin: so large, so luxe and so loaded with amenities that Daniel Boone would hardly know where to hang his coonskin hat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William Raphael spent $12.5 million on his vacation log home in New York's Catskill Mountains. The 15,000-square-foot residence, completed in 2011, has six bedrooms with attached bathrooms and two half-baths. It includes a 3,600-square-foot playroom with a table shuffleboard, a ping-pong table, three hanging TVs, a media room and a bar. The great room has a 38-foot-tall tongue-and-groove ceiling, wide-plank, hand-hewn walnut floors and a 10-foot-wide fireplace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite its size, the spaces include rustic touches: The staircase railings still have bark on them, and the treads are made of logs cut in half.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I know it's going to be there for 100 years," says Mr. Raphael, a retired manufacturing executive who primarily lives in Ridgewood, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To create his dream cabin, Mr. Raphael traveled the country, taking photographs of log lodges at a number of national parks because he was enamored with the architecture. He then met with Jay Pohley, president of Pioneer Log Homes in Victor, Mont., and together, they came up with a design for the home, located in Windham, N.Y. The exterior features native stone and hand-peeled standing dead timber -- trees that were killed by wildfire or disease and then harvested from their setting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once an icon of humble Americana, evoking images of Abe Lincoln, log homes are getting larger and more elaborate, with intricate truss work, expansive windows and even contemporary, curved elements. Instead of dark, low-slung cabins, homeowners are opting for airier, lighter versions with open layouts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advances in log-home building have also been driving luxury construction. The chinking, used to fill the gaps between logs, is commonly synthetic in the newer homes. The acrylic polymers adhere to wood better than the traditional sand-cement chinking, which pulled away from the wood as it expanded and contracted, allowing cold drafts, rain and bugs inside. As Mr. Pohley puts it, "synthetic chinking saved our industry."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some builders also use logs reinforced with steel rods to minimize sagging as the house settles over time -- a common side effect of log homes. The technique also allows architects to create more complex designs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And builders are increasingly constructing what are called hybrid homes -- log homes with a traditional lumber framework that is covered by a veneer of half-logs, half-cut timbers or stone on the outside and inside. This method makes it easier to install electrical, plumbing and insulation in the home, says Ellis Nunn, an architect in Jackson Hole, Wyo. Mr. Nunn and his wife, Sharon, recently designed a 25,000-square-foot hybrid home for a client in Chattanooga, Tenn., with 10 bedrooms, 13 bathrooms, staff quarters, mood lighting and automated doggy doors. The 10-acre estate includes a log sports pavilion with tennis courts and an outdoor entertainment area where the owners host charity events, and a log guesthouse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the downturn in the economy has put a dent in the log-cabin market in recent years. Murray Arnott, a log-home designer in Ontario, says he saw a steep drop in demand starting in 2009. And even with the real-estate rebound, log homes remain a niche market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Raphael put his log home on the market for $12.5 million a year and a half ago; it has already had a price drop and is now listed at $9.75 million. He says he "put his heart and soul" into the home, but that he's selling because he's ready to move on to another project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John A. Burke Jr., a broker who sells homes in New York's Adirondacks, says there is a market for handcrafted log homes, albeit a small one. That results in more inventory than demand. "Log homes have so many unique characteristics that sometimes people say, 'Let's just build our own,'" Mr. Burke says, which compounds the surplus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim McKinney, an investment banker in Chicago, worked with <span class="companylink">PFB Corp</span>.'s Precision Craft Log &amp; Timber Homes in Meridian, Idaho, on his nearly 7,000-square-foot vacation home in Jackson Hole, Wyo., which cost about $3 million. By using steel-reinforced logs, Mr. McKinney was able to get a 27-foot-wide floor-to-ceiling window framed between cedar logs, giving him sweeping views of the Grand Tetons in his great room. "It looks like the trees are coming out of the ground," Mr. McKinney says of the logs that hold the window.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I wanted it to be really, really old looking," says Mr. McKinney, who built a master bath with wood reclaimed from Old Faithful Lodge at Yellowstone National Park and hung a "Bath 25 cent" sign outside the steam shower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He had the walnut floors on the main floor hand-scraped and the granite countertops in the kitchen torched and sandblasted to make them look rough. Finishing touches include a wood-paneled icebox, silver dollars imprinted in the bar with an old brass cash register sitting on top and a great room that has an 18-foot canoe perched in the corner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building a luxury log home takes about six to eight months longer than a traditional timber-framed home and costs 10% to 40% more because of the labor involved in hand-crafting elements of the home. Typically, the bark is hand-peeled off the logs with a drawknife to give it a rustic, uneven look. Logs often are notched, another time-consuming task, so the corners can be fitted together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Delivery costs typically comprise 2% of the overall project cost because most handcrafted log-homes are constructed on a factory or logging site and then disassembled and numbered for shipping. For a $5 million log home recently completed in the mountains of Cyprus, Jim Banner of Precision Craft estimates the fees for 25, 40-foot-long shipping containers cost about $100,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices for logs have increased about 15% in the past five years, in part because fewer mills are logging. At the same time, the amount of standing dead timber that is available is increasing as forest fires and infestations such as pine-beetle kill become more prevalent, which has kept prices from rising faster, Mr. Pohley says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most popular type of log used is the Douglas fir because of its strength, followed by lodgepole pines, which are about 10% to 20% cheaper. Other high-end choices include Western red cedar and Engelmann spruce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are unexpected challenges. For example, Judith Carpenter was asked to decide the placement of every light switch and electrical outlet before her 9,000-square-foot farmhouse in Norwood, N.C., was completed in 2008. Unlike homes with Sheetrock over wall studs, it's hard to cut openings in the logs and pull wiring through after the home has been assembled. Five years later, Ms. Carpenter says there are one or two places where she wished she put in outlets -- particularly in the bedrooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Carpenter, a former state champion in trap shooting, runs the property as a retreat that includes trap shooting, a tilapia farm and a soon-to-come shrimp farm. The $3 million main home has three bedrooms and six bathrooms and includes a downstairs game room with a pool table and home theater and nearly 1,000 square feet of outdoor porches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Carpenter wanted a log cabin because it stands apart from the brick- and vinyl-sided homes in the area. "It's unlike anything else around here," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Log cabins can stand the test of time, lasting a century or more, with regular maintenance. Most log homes should be restained every three to five years, builders say, to prevent sun damage, and rechinked as needed to prevent air infiltration. Mr. McKinney, the Jackson Hole homeowner, is currently rechinking and touching up a few spots that have been worn down from the sun and from when the sprinklers hit the home, even though it is only a couple of years old.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some log-cabin homeowners invoke nostalgia and childhood fantasies in their designs. Race-car driver Tony Stewart recently completed a more-than-15,000-square-foot home with six bedrooms and 12 bathrooms in Columbus, Ind., that is reminiscent of <span class="companylink">Bass Pro Shops</span>, a company that is one of his sponsors and that uses the same supplier of logs in Mr. Stewart's home, according to people familiar with the project. The residence has a 1,600-cubic-foot aquarium, two trout ponds and a two-lane bowling alley, according to a brochure by the home's builder. A lower level includes a game room and two racing display cases, plus an actual Indianapolis 500 car hung on the wall. Mr. Stewart declined to comment, but people familiar with the project say the home is, as one person put it, "a far cry from a cabin."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, Mr. Raphael hopes his passion for his log home rubs off on potential buyers. He has enjoyed spending Christmas there, inviting friends over to play ping pong in the game room and gather in the kitchen to watch hockey games while food is prepped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Sometimes, I live there for weeks on end," Mr. Raphael says. "It's a great place to have hot chocolate and burn a fire."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Icon of Pioneer Life</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scandinavians were the first settlers to bring log cabins to America, in the 1630s, according to research by the late historian C.A. Weslager. The cabins became a symbol for pioneers because they could be constructed quickly. Log-home popularity increased in the 1880s as settlers swept westward and then experienced another revival in the 1930s, when President Franklin Roosevelt's Civilian Conservation Corps was deployed to build lodges for the National Parks Service after the Depression.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Log homes have earned a recurring role in popular culture. Here is a brief sampler:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S BIRTHPLACE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February 1809, Lincoln was born in a log cabin on his family's Sinking Spring Farm in Kentucky, about 60 miles from Louisville. He lived there for two years until his family moved down the road to Knob Creek Farm, where he lived in another log cabin until he was 7 years old. When Lincoln's family moved to Indiana, they built another log cabin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOG CABIN SYRUP</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This brand was founded in 1887 by Minnesota grocer Patrick Towle, who named the syrup in honor of childhood hero, President Lincoln. Last year, Log Cabin syrup had retail sales of about $75 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OLD FAITHFUL INN</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Built during the winter of 1903-04, the iconic log hotel at Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming is nearly 700 feet long and seven stories tall. When it opened in 1904, 140 rooms were available for $4 a night, 50 cents extra to bathe; today there are more than 320 rooms, starting at $103 a night in the summer for an 'old house' original room with a shared bath.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LINCOLN LOGS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Created in 1916 by John Lloyd Wright, the son of Frank Lloyd Wright, Lincoln Logs were, once again, named after President Lincoln. K'NEX, the manufacturer and distributor of Lincoln Logs since 1999, says each log is made with real wood and then placed in a tumbler for a splinter-free, smooth finish. Since 2001, K'NEX has sold more than six million sets and this year has produced more than 34 million Lincoln Logs pieces.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sanette Tanaka </div><div>1220 words</div><div>28 June 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a new breed of quick-change artist on the real-estate front: luxury flippers who focus on high-end properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Popular before the housing bust, house flipping -- where a property is bought, renovated and sold quickly to make a profit -- is seeing a comeback nationwide. Rising prices and tight inventory are driving more investors to the upper end of the market. Flips of homes priced at $1 million or more shot up 35% in 2012 compared with 2011, according to market researcher RealtyTrac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Investors have actually run out of inventory on the low end of flips, and now they're moving to the higher end," says Daren Blomquist, vice president of RealtyTrac. The million-dollar homes are "the untapped market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some new players are behind the uptick: foreign buyers, institutional investors and professionals who have made money in other industries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In this market now with these numbers, everyone thinks they're going to catch the next wave," says Zar Zanganeh, a real-estate broker in Las Vegas, adding that he gets three times as many requests for homes to flip now than a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patricia Delinois, president and chief executive officer of Century 21 Premier Elite Realty in Miami, facilitated a flip for a 6,255-square-foot "complete fixer-upper," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property was purchased in January 2012 for $1.2 million by an investment group led by an American and backed by Venezuelan, Brazilian, Colombian, Russian and French investors. They renovated the kitchen and bathrooms, installed top-of-the-line appliances and lighting, and decked it out with luxury finishes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The renovations cost almost $1 million, she says. Now it is on the market for $2.98 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Washington, D.C., Beth Hughes, a real-estate agent with DCRE Residential who finds homes for flippers, last summer found a 2,000-square-foot house in Columbia Heights for Jordan Ghrist, president of Level One Development LLC. He bought the four-bedroom, 3 1/2-bathroom house for $461,500 and gave it a "total gut job," he says. Mr. Ghrist has a $2 million fund so he can pay with cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house went under contract for $805,000 about a month ago after a mere three days on the market. The sale is expected to close this week -- netting about 28% in profit, he estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flipping high-end homes can be particularly challenging. Selling a luxury property can take longer than a midprice home, and renovation costs can be steep, because high-end buyers expect to be wowed. Plenty of flippers have lost money. RealtyTrac data show that in Naples-Marco Island, Fla., for example, flippers who purchased homes for $1 million or more lost 14% of their investment when the property sold within six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ideally, the purchase, renovation and sale should occur within six months to maximize profits, says Bruce Bartlett, managing partner at Sequoia Real Estate Partners, a private-equity firm in Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These aren't paint-and-lipstick jobs. Basically, you have to re-envision the entire house," says Mr. Bartlett, who flips single-family and multifamily homes with a team of partners, including Eric Sussman, senior lecturer at the Ziman Center for Real Estate at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bartlett recently bought a 1,850-square-foot modern house in Los Angeles's Hollywood Hills for $690,000. He then spent $50,000, mostly on cosmetic changes, adding walnut flooring and railings, maple cabinets and granite counters in the kitchen, a new wet bar, and fresh paint. He expects the house to close this week for $888,888 -- at a 20% profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When buying a home to flip, Mr. Bartlett says he first considers the foundation, roof, electrical system, plumbing, and heating and air-conditioning. "That's where you really drop all your money when you fix a house," he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For materials, Mr. Bartlett shops at outlet and wholesale stores. He looks for sales and asks for deals. In the Hollywood Hills house, he wanted a white-patterned decorative tile, but designer-name versions were too pricey, from $40 to $77 per square foot. Instead, he opted for a generic wall tile that cost $3.82 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For items that people see, such as appliances and fixtures, he'll buy brand names. Sometimes he buys in bulk. "<span class="companylink">Costco</span> had really, really great Hansgrohe bathroom faucets for $70 each. I took 20," he says. "I don't know yet where I'll use it, but I know I'll use it. And when a buyer comes into the house, he'll see Hansgrohe."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High-end flips are particularly gaining traction in the markets hardest hit during the downturn. Investors could scoop up homes at big discounts in areas that now have some of the highest home-appreciation rates. Some metro areas have seen more than a sevenfold increase in million-dollar flips over the past year, although million-dollar homes make up less than 1% of all flips, according to RealtyTrac data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The million-plus flips offer more room to make a profit. The high demand means investors can take bigger risks in rehabbing -- and get higher prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Atlanta, property appraiser Dan Fries says the $1 million homes he appraises are typically valued for $250,000 more after they are flipped, depending on whether the changes improve the house functionally or are purely cosmetic. Sometimes, he says, investors earn back five times the amount they put into renovations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent months, high-end flippers have had to be creative in finding homes. Mr. Bartlett, the Los Angeles flipper, bought a house in Rancho Palos Verdes after a friend told him the owner had died, and his family, who had inherited the property, lived out of town. The property had been vacant for six months and had water damage. He called the family's real-estate agent, who sold the property to him for $825,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He plans to spend $200,000 to create an open floor plan, reconfigure the master bedroom, redo the landscaping and put in air-conditioning. Normally, he doesn't take on houses that need a complete overhaul, but he expects this one to sell for $1.4 million, a 37% profit, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lloyd Segal, a house flipper himself and author of "Flipping Houses," a guide to buying and fixing houses, finds homes through bankruptcy courts, probate courts, courthouse auctions and people in his network, to whom he'll pay an assignment fee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes he just drives around Los Angeles to scout properties. That's how he found one of his latest homes, which he bought for $2.85 million. "I was late for a date and driving like a maniac through Hollywood. I see this little sign that said 'For Sale' and a phone number," says Mr. Segal, adding that he immediately pulled off the side of the road to call. "I was late for the date. You can see my priorities. Don't tell anyone that."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sarah Portlock                 And Eric Morath   </div><div>472 words</div><div>27 June 2013</div><div>10:51</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—The number of prospective buyers signing contracts to buy previously owned homes surged last month to the highest level in more than six years, the latest sign of a strengthening housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> on Thursday said its seasonally adjusted index for pending sales of existing homes rose to a reading of 112.3 in May, up 6.7% from the previous month and a gain of 12.1% from a year earlier. Contract activity is at its strongest pace since December 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, the group's chief economist, pointed to pent-up demand as a driving force behind the improvements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Even with limited choices, it appears some of the rise in contract signings could be from buyers wanting to take advantage of current affordability conditions before mortgage interest rates move higher," Mr. Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reading surpassed expectations. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast the index would rise 1% from April. That month's reading was revised downward to 105.2. An index of 100 is equal to the average level of contract activity during 2001.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pending-home sales report measures signed contracts to purchase homes. It typically takes one to two months to complete a sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regionally, sales rose in the Northeast, Midwest and West but fell in the South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report comes after a series of positive signs for the housing market recently as prices rise, home sales surge and builders grow more confident about constructing new homes. Homeowners may feel more comfortable that they can sell their properties, in turn encouraging more sellers to test the market and adding to the available supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors group reported last week that sales of previously owned homes rose in May to the highest level since late 2009, pushing prices along with it. And new-home sales rose 2.1% in May to its highest level since July 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report earlier this week, existing-home prices in 20 U.S. metropolitan areas were 12.1% higher in April than a year earlier, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller national index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a sharp rise in mortgage rates could undermine that recovery. While rates are still very low by historical standards, a sudden increase could make buyers less willing or able to tolerate higher prices. The average rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances increased to 4.46%, the highest rate since August 2011, from the prior week's 4.17%, the Mortgage Bankers Association said Wednesday.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Lauren Davidson   </div><div>416 words</div><div>27 June 2013</div><div>16:46</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar inched higher against some currencies after a set of reports pointed to strength in the housing market and rising incomes in the U.S., increasing optimism that the economy is on the mend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. currency gained against the yen and pound after a gauge of housing activity known as the pending home sales index—which measures signed but not completed contracts—reached its highest point in more than six years. Data from the Commerce Department show personal income rose by 0.5% in May, beating estimates, with spending up by 0.3%. Weekly jobless claims also fell slightly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar rose to a high of ¥98.58, up from ¥97.74 late Wednesday, and was trading at ¥98.32 by late afternoon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the dollar's performance was mixed overall, with the euro changing hands at $1.3040 compared with $1.3012 late Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar's modest gains were likely held back by lingering uncertainty about coming changes in monetary policy at the Federal Reserve. Since Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke announced last week that the central bank was considering reducing stimulus later this year by winding down its $85 billion-a-month bond-buying program, markets have experienced more volatility, prompting several Fed officials to try to clarify the central bank's intentions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York Fed President William Dudley added to the discussion Thursday, saying that markets may have misinterpreted Mr. Bernanke's message by moving forward expectations for tighter monetary policy. "A rise in short-term rates is very likely to be a long way off," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Markets are, frankly, still digesting the Fed's message," said Vassili Serebriakov, a currency strategist at <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span>. "But the effects of these Fed speakers' comments over the last few days have been to calm markets a little bit. We're seeing less pressure on the bond market, which settles the FX market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Australian dollar gained slightly, trading at $0.9289, up from $0.9278 late Wednesday. The pound dropped 0.4% to $1.5257 on disappointing gross domestic product figures, "highlighting that the U.K. economy still remains well below pre-crisis levels," said Mr. Serebriakov. The pound traded at $1.5314 late Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar bought 0.9451 Swiss franc, up from 0.9431 franc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wall Street Journal Dollar Index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, was at 74.67.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Josh Barbanel </div><div>745 words</div><div>27 June 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A26</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While home prices in many parts of the country are seeing a sharp rebound, in Manhattan -- a bellwether market for affluent buyers -- co-op and condo sales prices and the number of transactions have remained surprisingly flat, according to the latest data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A review of city sales records shows that closed sales and median prices were nearly unchanged over the past year. The median price was up 0.2% and the number of sales rose 0.7% in the second quarter, compared with the same quarter last year. Average prices were off 2.2% in the quarter from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flat year-over-year performance comes even as Manhattan brokers and buyers have been complaining about a shortage of inventory and bidding wars, marking a shift in the balance of market power to sellers. The number of deals listed as being in contracts is as high as it has been in years, according to brokers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even though the market is extremely tight, brokers say buyers are showing caution. Many are still worried about the last housing bust and have been eager to avoid overpaying for properties. That has helped keep a lid on the median prices of apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hall F. Willkie, the president of Brown Harris Stevens, said that despite "a great demand and a small supply," buyers, even very wealthy ones, "are reluctant to pay a price that is not justifiable."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industry executives also note that the highest-priced sales deals signed during the latest quarter won't be filed with the city until the third quarter at the earliest and even later in some cases. Developers have been raising asking prices on new projects, but any stratospheric sales agreements won't appear in market reports until 2014 or 2015 when the developments finally open.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market is going forward full speed ahead, but the market is very selective" said Kirk Henckels, the director of Stribling Private Brokerage. "Buyers are not the drunken sailors they were back then."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Noah Rosenblatt, a broker who runs real-estate data website UrbanDigs.com, said that the number of new contracts signed this year has "gone through the roof" and has been the highest it has been since early 2008. This could drive median and average prices higher later in the year, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Rosenblatt also noted that after a multiyear slide in listings, there has been a modest rise in the inventory in two consecutive months as more sellers decided it was time to sell. He said the flat market statistic suggests that the market may be approaching a "top" after recovering from steep declines in the economic downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the second quarter the median price of a Manhattan condo or co-op was $851,750, up from $850,000 in the second quarter of 2012. The average price of a Manhattan apartment was $1.4 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures were compiled by The Wall Street Journal from closed sales filed with the city's Department of Finance as of five days before the end of each quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the latest quarter, condo prices were much stronger than co-op prices, as some very expensive condominiums opened. The median condo price rose by 13.6% to $1.125 million, the highest since the second quarter of 2008, while the median co-op price of $659,500 fell by 0.3% compared with the second quarter last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But part of the increase in condo prices was due to a drop in sales of lower-priced condominiums. The number of condominiums sold for less than $1 million fell by 10.4% in the latest quarter, while the number selling for more than $1 million rose 5.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were few very big sales in the second quarter and most of those were in newly opened condominiums. During the second quarter of 2012, there were two sales of co-ops topping $30 million, including the $52 million sale of an apartment at 740 Park Ave. to Howard Marks, the investment manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But so far in this year's second quarter there haven't been any sales over $30 million. The top sale was in the Abingdon, a new condominium in the West Village, for $29.8 million.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Asian Buyers Dig Into U.S. Property</span>
</div><div class="author">By Craig Karmin </div><div>1005 words</div><div>26 June 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asian investors are pumping money into U.S. commercial real estate at a record pace, pushing real-estate values higher and helping get stalled projects off the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Equity investments in the U.S. from Singapore, South Korea and China are already at all-time highs this year, for a combined total of $5.2 billion though mid-June, according to data from <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>. At this pace, Singapore and China would invest several times their amounts of last year, while South Korea would more than triple its investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors from these countries have included on their shopping lists a Hawaiian resort, an office tower on Chicago's swank West Wacker Drive and New York condo developments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The forces behind the surge vary. Some Asian pension funds are expanding and accumulating assets as they prepare to support aging populations; state-run funds are scouring the world for diversification and stability; and some Asian countries, including China, also are liberalizing rules about investment abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent upheaval in global financial markets and the rise in bond yields could damp the recent interest, especially if interest rates continue to climb and make debt refinancing on large properties more expensive. China has been particularly volatile in recent days over concerns that its central bank may tighten credit and slow lending growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some Asian investors and developers say their initial deals are part of a long-term strategy. For example, Chinese property developer <span class="companylink">China Vanke Co</span>. teamed up with U.S. developer Tishman Speyer earlier this year to develop a San Francisco condominium project. <span class="companylink">China Vanke</span> did the deal partly "to understand business models in a mature market and accumulate management experience through project cooperation," the company's chairman Shi Wangsaid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asian and other foreign investors have had a mixed record in buying U.S. property. Japanese companies notoriously purchased trophy properties such as Manhattan's Rockefeller Center and the Pebble Beach golf course during the 1980s. When the market collapsed, most of them sold and took big losses. <span class="companylink">Mitsubishi Estate Co</span>., for one, announced an annual loss of $934 million in 1996, caused by its failed Rockefeller Center investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those that hung on for the longer term benefited. <span class="companylink">Mitsui Fudosan Co</span>. continued to hold the 2.3 million-square-foot tower at 1251 Sixth Ave. in Manhattan. Today, the company says that is the most valuable property in its portfolio. The building's value is over $2 billion, analysts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some real-estate analysts say Asian investment is part of a long-term diversification strategy, making it less susceptible to short-term price or rate movements. Those capital flows could prove crucial to the U.S. property-market recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is less pressure on these investors to chase yield," says Howard Roth, head of global real estate for <span class="companylink">Ernst &amp; Young</span>. "They are looking to invest for the next generation, not just for a few years like private-equity funds."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In what would be one of the largest U.S. property deals since the financial crisis, a group of Singapore investors is in advanced talks with Houston-based developer Hines to revive a stalled luxury condo development connected to Manhattan's Museum of Modern Art, according to people familiar with the negotiations. The group includes the Kwee family, which owns Singapore property developer Pontiac Land and is one of the largest landlords in the city-state. The family is looking to invest about $300 million in equity, and Singapore's <span class="companylink">United Overseas Bank</span> and other lenders are in discussions to lend up to $800 million, these people said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representatives of Hines, the Kwee family and <span class="companylink">United Overseas Bank</span> declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some headwinds for foreign investment remain. Foremost may be a U.S. tax on foreigners when they acquire a stake in a U.S. property, which historically has discouraged large foreign real-estate purchases. A slow U.S. economic recovery also has confined most Asian and other foreign buyers to the biggest cities, where supply can be limited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the U.S. is often the preferred destination of Asian investors because it offers a broad of mix of office buildings, hotels, retail and industrial properties. The market has better disclosure and title rights than high-octane emerging markets and better growth prospects than Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Singapore, the No. 1 Asian investor in U.S. property this year, has invested about $1.9 billion as of mid-June. That is more than the cumulative total that the city-state has invested in the U.S. over the past decade, Real Capital data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Singapore's recent deals include the <span class="companylink">Government of Singapore Investment Corp</span>.'s acquisition of an office building in San Francisco's Financial District. GIC also bought a resort in Maui and four other hotels from hedge-fund manager John Paulson's real-estate fund. In June, Singapore property investor <span class="companylink">Overseas Union Enterprise</span> completed its purchase of U.S. Bank Tower in Los Angeles, the tallest building in California, for $367.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China has invested more than $1.5 billion in 2013, compared with $300 million in 2012, according to Real Capital. Last year, the <span class="companylink">China Insurance Regulatory Commission</span> paved the way for more deals by relaxing the rules for some big insurers to invest in certain types of overseas property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meantime, numerous South Korean investors are shopping in the U.S. For example, <span class="companylink">Mirae Asset Global Investments Co</span>. recently agreed to pay $218 million to acquire an office tower on Chicago's West Wacker Drive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">South Korea pension funds, flush with contributions from an aging population, increasingly have been looking for property outside the domestic market. Representatives of country's National Pension System are making the rounds in New York, looking to invest a mimimum $100 million in office buildings, hotels or shopping malls, commercial real-estate brokers say.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of new homes rose to the highest level in nearly five years in May and a key gauge of existing-home prices surged, indicating substantial strength in the housing sector ahead of recent worries about rising mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales rose 2.1% in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 476,000 new homes, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. That was the highest level since July 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller index showed that existing-home prices in 20 U.S. metropolitan areas were 12.1% higher in April than a year earlier. Home prices posted their largest monthly gain since the Case-Shiller data began, rising 2.5% in April from March in the 20-city index. On a seasonally adjusted basis, the 20-city index rose at a 1.7% monthly rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reports underscore how a resurgent housing sector is serving as a key anchor to the economic recovery. A strong housing market can ripple through the U.S. economy by driving demand for construction materials, creating jobs and bolstering consumer confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, a sharp rise in mortgage rates since last month could undermine the sector's powerful recovery. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage increased to 4.6% this week, from 3.59% in early May, after the Federal Reserve indicated last week that it could start slowing its bond purchases later this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though rising borrowing costs didn't appear to damp housing sales in May, some analysts warned the effects could hit in coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But David Blitzer, chairman of S&amp;P's index committee, predicted the housing-market recovery would continue despite higher rates, in part because recent data indicate banks are easing credit restrictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home buyers have survived rising mortgage rates in the past, often by shifting from fixed-rate to adjustable-rate loans," he said. "In the housing boom, bust and recovery, banks' credit quality standards were more important than the level of mortgage rates."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said sales of previously owned homes rose 4.2% to 5.2 million in May, their highest level since 2009, while median prices surged 15% on the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data prompted the real-estate trade group to call for a rapid increase in home building to temper the rapid rise in prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department on Tuesday said the median price for new homes sold in May eased slightly to $263,900 from $272,600 in April. Economists had expected prices to moderate somewhat after rapid increases in previous months. The stock of new homes for sale at the end of May was 161,000, the highest level since August 2011, and representing around 4.1 months of supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">S&amp;P said that average U.S. home prices, measured by the Case-Shiller index, returned in April to their early 2004 levels, but still remain 26% to 27% below their peaks in June and July of 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a year-over-year basis, all 20 cities that Case-Shiller tracks have recorded home-price growth for at least four straight months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During April, San Francisco had the biggest increase at 24%. Month-to-month, 19 cities showed improvement. Detroit was the exception, with home prices remaining flat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markets that took the brunt of the housing bust have been among those with the strongest growth lately. During April, Phoenix and Las Vegas both saw price gains of roughly 22% from a year earlier.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dune Real Estate Partners LP, which was spun off from Dune Capital Partners, is an investor in a new condominium at 56 Leonard St. A Property article Wednesday misidentified Dune Capital as the investor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(WSJ June 27, 2013)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A penthouse atop a new condominium skyscraper that resembles a pile of haphazardly stacked boxes has gone into contract for $47 million, a record for a condo sale below Midtown Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the deal is completed, the purchase at a 820-foot glass tower under construction at 56 Leonard St. in TriBeCa would be the high-water mark in a strong surge of condo deals this year in marquee developments coming to market downtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wealthy buyers, including many from nearby neighborhoods, have been snapping up many units in new developments, often based on floor plans and model show rooms, even for buildings that won't open for many months or sometimes years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Izak Senbahar, president of Alexico Group, who is heading up the development team at 56 Leonard, identified the buyer as a New York-based hedge-fund manager but he declined to provide further details.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is a stronger market than in 2008," he said. "The market has really changed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building is essentially the same modernist tower designed by Pritzker Prize-winning architects at Herzog &amp; de Meuron that went on the market just before the financial crash in 2008. Sales were soon halted then and the off-site sales center was mothballed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in February, the 145 apartments in the same 60-story building went back on the market in the same showroom that was closed in 2008. Since then 80% of the building has been sold, with sales totaling $900 million to date, according to the developers. Asking prices are now 19% higher than they were in 2008, condominium plan filings show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 150 Charles St., another new development that went on the market in February, all but one of the 91 condos is now in contract, according to Leonard Steinberg, a broker at <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>, who is marketing apartments there. That building in the West Village has a more traditional design.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last fall another new condo development, a five-bedroom penthouse at 18 Gramercy Park, a former residence for women on Gramercy Park, went into contract for the full asking price of $42 million that set the previous record for downtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Walker Tower, a condominium built in a 1929 telephone company tower on West 18th Street in Chelsea, about 80% of the 46 apartments have gone into contract, and the developers, JDS Development and Property Markets Group are preparing to list a 6,000-square-foot penthouse for $55 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Steinberg said that the surging sales in new condominium towers shows that buyers in Manhattan are now more interested in light and air and views than the features in a particular neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is a huge premium people will pay for a view," he said. "Manhattan has become a lot less neighborhood specific."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still the highest prices in contract downtown lag behind those in the latest glass towers in Midtown, like One57 on West 57th Street, where two apartments are in contract for $90 million or more and at 432 Park Ave., a slender tower on the corner of 56th Street where a high-floor penthouse was under contract for $95 million, the developers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kelly Mack, the president of Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, which is marketing the condos at 56 Leonard, said the duplex penthouse totals about 7,800 square feet plus more than 1,200 square feet of terraces. The space works out to about $6,000 a square foot, far below sales at top buildings near Central Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, she said that the pending sale highlighted a fundamental shift of buyer sentiment in favor of downtown buildings, where average prices have been rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The downtown market is one of the most talked about in the city," she said. "For the first time there are super prime luxury developments that are powering the downtown market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alexico Group is joining with Dune Capital and funds managed by <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group</span> to develop the Leonard Street building. When they launched sales in February, the penthouse, with 19-foot ceilings and a large sculptural wood-burning fireplace, was listed for far less, $32 million, and was considerably smaller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after sales began, Ms. Mack said, the developers discovered city building rules allowed additional floor space. They added a second floor to the penthouse with some outdoor space and listed the enlarged apartment for $50 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The revised plans for the penthouse included a private infinity pool. But the buyer didn't want a pool, Ms. Mack said, so it was eliminated, and the final price was cut by $3 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building -- the tallest in TriBeCa -- is designed with cantilevered floors that create private outdoor spaces with unique layouts for each apartment. A large curved creation by the sculptor Anish Kapoor will be incorporated into the building's base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building amenities include a 75-foot-long pool, an outdoor sun deck and hot tub facing the Hudson, a fitness center, a private dining room and children play spaces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is due to open in the summer of 2015.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Climbing Rates Seen Stalling Rise in Values --- Downward Pressure Is Likely on Prices and Demand; REIT Shares and Commercial Mortgage Bond Market Take a Hit</span>
</div><div class="author">By Eliot Brown and Al Yoon </div><div>934 words</div><div>26 June 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sharp rise in interest rates in recent weeks has raised the specter in the commercial-real-estate industry that nearly four years of steady gains in property values could come to a halt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently, the low-rate environment had been fueling the rise in property values, even while rents and occupancies generally remained below peak levels amid sluggish growth. Lowering borrowing costs enabled buyers to pay more. Also, low rates increased demand for property from investors who felt yields were too low in the bond market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts warn that higher rates likely will put downward pressure on prices and demand even as if the recovering economy keeps giving gradual rise to rents and occupancy rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We think that rising rates will largely cancel out rent growth and stall out values," said Tad Philipp, director of commercial-real-estate research at Moody's Investors Service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seeing the changing environment, investors in publicly traded real-estate investment trusts have been big sellers recently. Since the stock market's May 21 high, the Dow Jones Equity All REIT Index has fallen 14% through Tuesday, compared with a 4.9% decline by the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's 500</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The higher rates also have clobbered the market for commercial mortgage-backed securities, or CMBS, a major source of debt in the commercial property industry. Rates being charged to borrowers have gone up more than a full percentage point, and the value of the bonds have sharply declined in market trading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, the rate increase could prove to be fleeting, and today's rates are still quite low on a historic basis. In addition, at times, commercial real-estate values have climbed with rising rates, typically when rents and hotel rates have risen, as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for now, many investors are focusing on the damage. "It's a dramatic change in a very short period of time," said Andrew Solomon, a managing director at <span class="companylink">Angelo Gordon &amp; Co</span>. who invests in CMBS. "It's pretty darn close to a 180."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The value of commercial property nose-dived after the 2008 economic downturn. An index tracking property owned by REITs compiled by <span class="companylink">Green Street Advisors Inc</span>. fell 38% between 2007 and 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Values started recovering as the economy stabilized. But at first, the improvement was limited to trophy properties in top cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real-estate recovery accelerated and broadened as investors seeking higher yields flooded the market. Commercial-property values in May were 4% above their 2007 peak and 69% above their 2009 nadir, according to an index by Green Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, low interest rates "have been the primary driver" for rising values, said Mike Kirby, chairman of Green Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yields on 10-year Treasury notes soared above 2.5% this month, from 2.16% at the start of June and 1.64% on May 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The change was sparked by investor fear that the Federal Reserve's plan to end to its $85 billion-a-month bond-buying program will drive up interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise will likely cool the CMBS market by making borrowing more expensive. Before May, some analysts were projecting that Wall Street would sell as much as $100 billion in CMBS this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But analysts are now cutting their projections. <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Ratings Services projected on June 14 that a sustained higher interest-rate environment would lead to about $15 billion less issuance in the second half of the year, totaling $65 billion for the full year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"CMBS issuance is certainly, for the foreseeable future, going down," said Harris Trifon, an analyst at <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank AG</span>. "These types of movements [in interest rates] are extraordinarily rare."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Caught in the middle of the shift are CMBS lenders who made and stockpiled loans before rates began rising and are only now selling them as securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> and <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>., for example, had been planning to sell $1.18 billion of CMBS last week. But, instead of pricing the deal as a whole, the firms delayed selling the majority of the issue until Monday, when they boosted yields on $360 million of the bonds by three-hundredths of a percentage point to 1.20 percentage points over an interest-rate benchmark, according to investors familiar with the issue. The bonds sold on Monday with yields at 3.95%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That yield is up significantly from the day before Treasury yields began their march higher in May. Back then, <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co</span>. sold similar CMBS debt at a 0.82 percentage point so-called spread, or a 2.62% yield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That increase has caused some borrowers to pull back, while others say they may hold off on refinancing properties if they think the rates are too high and could come down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in rates is causing landlords who borrowed before rates spiked feel rather pleased with themselves. This spring, Robert Tunnell Jr., managing principal of the family-owned Tunnell Cos., secured a $68 million loan on a Long Neck, Del.-based manufactured-housing community with an interest rate of 4%. Today, the rate for the same loan would likely be well above 4.5%, Mr. Tunnell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're real happy with the rate we got and the timing, especially with everything that happened last week," he said. "In hindsight, it looks like we did pretty well."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Brenda Cronin   </div><div>1535 words</div><div>25 June 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>14</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After four bumpy years, the U.S. recovery finally appears to be on a smoother road.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists now predict 2014 will be the best year for growth since 2005, while joblessness is expected to click below 7% next year for the first time since 2008. Houses are selling again, the energy sector is booming and jobs, while not plentiful, are being created at a steady pace. On Wednesday, the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> upped its estimate for next year's expansion as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There have been earlier waves of optimism that the economy was poised for better growth, and the past week's financial-market turmoil is a reminder that a lot still could go wrong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">News that the Fed could start dialing back stimulus later this year sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 2.34% on Thursday. The average closed at 14799.40 Friday, down 1.80% for the week. A persistent decline in stock prices or faster-than-expected increases in mortgage and other long-term interest rates could slow the recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has been a long haul. The recovery that began in June 2009 has been painfully slow. Jobs, median household income, industrial production and home prices still haven't returned to the levels they were at before the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But despite the weak pace of overall growth, the recovery has proved surprisingly resilient. The economy has absorbed a series of shocks, from tax hikes to a tsunami in Japan, without getting knocked off course or falling back into recession. And crucially, inflation remains low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The good news is if [the recovery] continues to ratchet up gradually," the economy could see growth persist and strengthen, says Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Global Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will take a prolonged upturn to make up ground lost during the recession, which stretched from December 2007 through June 2009. Long-term unemployment, a hallmark of the recession's toll, remains at historically high levels. The economy has been expanding, but at a 2.2% annual pace, below the average 3.3% rate of recent decades. The federal government's belt-tightening has weighed on the recovery, but that impact is now dissipating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists in the latest Wall Street Journal monthly survey expect gross domestic product to expand at a 2.3% annual pace this year and 2.8% next year. The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> edged up 2014 growth forecasts to between 3% and 3.5%, from a March estimate of 2.9% to 3.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the central bank's policy-making committee met last week, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke explained the panel's recent optimism by saying the economy's "fundamentals look a little better to us."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such optimism about the recovery looks justified, thanks in part to the energy boom and the real-estate sector's patchy comeback. The property market's expected contribution to the economy during the second half of this year is the critical engine, says Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>, noting that housing gains benefit many other areas, from furniture sales to landscaping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier in the recovery, similar bouts of optimism flared, only to be snuffed out by events such as the tsunami in Japan, euro-zone turmoil and budget strife in Washington. While such shocks undercut the momentum, they didn't tip the economy back into recession. But each disappointment renewed skittishness among consumers and businesses scarred by the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're extremely cautious and not seeing dramatic growth," says Mike DePasquale, chief executive of BIO-key International, Inc. The Wall, N.J., company makes security software that recognizes biometric markers, such as fingerprints. In recent months, BIO-key added three employees, bringing its full-time staff to 19.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although demand at home and abroad remains brisk, the ordeal of the recession, when BIO-key laid off workers and streamlined operations, is still vivid. "We all sense that things are beginning to get better, but we don't innately feel it," Mr. DePasquale says. "There are still so many people that each of us know who are out of work or struggling in positions that are below where they were five years ago."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such doubts are inevitable amid a recovery that has defied the contours and pace of previous comebacks. The labor market remains strained, even as the unemployment rate has dropped to 7.6%, from double-digit levels. The U.S. has 2.4 million fewer jobs today than when the recession began. Adjusting for population growth, it will take more than nine years at the current rate of hiring to return to prerecession employment levels, according to estimates from the <span class="companylink">Brookings Institution</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slow hiring and scant wage growth have made the recovery feel no different from the recession for some. According to the latest WSJ/NBC News poll, 58% of Americans believe the country is in a recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That isn't surprising after a financial crisis that put households through their "worst losses of wealth in 80 years," says Robert Shapiro, chairman of Sonecon LLC, an advisory firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet, consumer confidence now stands at a five-year high. Households that borrowed extensively before the recession have pared their debt. After years of cutting back, they are spending again, moving beyond absolute essentials to big-ticket purchases that were postponed in leaner times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among those consumers is Abbie Batia, who says she and her husband had to "bite the bullet" and buy a bigger car to accommodate their growing family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Batias, of Orlando, Fla., have three children, ages 4, 2 and 9 months. They replaced their sport-utility vehicle -- which was all paid for, Mrs. Batia says -- with a larger SUV less than a year ago. Mrs. Batia, a part-time adjunct professor of exercise and sports science, and her husband, who works at a construction-management firm, are feeling more optimistic about the economy than they did during the recession, but remain careful about spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We were definitely pinching pennies more four years ago than we are now," says Mrs. Batia, who is 34. The family keeps to a monthly budget, she says, "but we haven't been hurting in other areas when we've had to add money to the grocery fund."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists see consumers now carrying this recovery forward, as a combination of slow gains in the job market and a snapback in housing improves their mood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Household balance sheets have shown "pretty good improvement," but about 20% of mortgage borrowers are still underwater on their loans, says Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at research firm Capital Economics. Businesses have reined in borrowing and strengthened their books, he says, but remain gun-shy about spending to expand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What we really want is business investment to rise well above just replacing worn-out stuff, and into getting new stuff," he says, "because when you get extra new stuff, you need new staff. When you buy two new vehicles, you need two new drivers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many businesses say they don't want to commit to new investment until they are sure that demand is there. Some continue to cut back in the face of wavering demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Aleris Corp</span>., a Cleveland-based aluminum processor with plants in the U.S., Europe and China, is hoping that America's housing rebound translates into increased sales. The company sells aluminum for gutters and other household uses, as well as for appliances such as washers and dryers that people often buy when moving into new homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're looking forward to that big jump in demand," says Sean Stack, the company's chief financial officer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2011, the company restarted its U.S. building-materials plant, which it had shut during the housing bust, but it is running at just 65% of capacity. Mr. Stack says he hopes demand will pick up this summer, based on the recent pace of home building. He adds the company has yet to see much improvement in demand in the division that provides aluminum for consumer products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, Aleris has been cutting costs, pulling back on travel spending, and trimming jobs -- about 150 white-collar positions so far this year in the U.S. and Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company hasn't applied the brakes across the board. It is moving forward with investments in facilities in North Carolina, Belgium and a new $350 million aluminum-rolling plant in Zhenjiang, China. In China, however, the company has seen "pockets of softness" after years of breakneck growth, Mr. Stack says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weakness overseas remains a wild card for the recovery. If the euro-zone recession gets worse and softness in China and elsewhere persists, that could stall momentum in the U.S. There also are risks closer to home. Fiscal clashes in Washington could further strain consumers and businesses. Already, the federal government has cut spending 4.5% since June 2009, compared with an average 6.3% increase in recoveries since 1970.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sarah Rose </div><div>845 words</div><div>24 June 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A21</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Richard Blanco read his stirring poem "One Today" at President Barack Obama's second inaugural ceremony in January, he spoke of "the last floor on the Freedom Tower jutting into a sky that yields to our resilience."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That prompted Jordan Barowitz, the director of external affairs for the Durst Organization, a part owner of the tower, to tweet: "Blanco, we like the shout out. But it's One World Trade Center!"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tallest building at the World Trade Center site is in the midst of a bit of an identity crisis as it nears completion. While the development's name was officially changed to One World Trade Center in 2009, many still refer to it as the Freedom Tower, the name it was given in 2003 when the trauma from the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack was still fresh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Not for long," says Douglas Durst, whose organization became a partner in the project, with the <span class="companylink">Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</span>, in 2010. He says the old name is fading quickly and, most important, there's no confusion among prospective tenants. "We're talking to a lot of people and it doesn't come up," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Freedom Tower still sticks with many members of the public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was so dramatic and poignant, as we were sailing away from America, the last two things we saw were the Statue of Liberty and the Freedom Tower," says Gracie Best, a native of New Hampshire who recently relocated to England with her husband aboard the Queen Mary 2.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, there was a flurry of media coverage as construction crews added a spire to the top of the building. Many of the stories used the old name.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Tonight, the Freedom Tower becomes the tallest building in the Western hemisphere," proclaimed Diane Sawyer on ABC's "World News."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Freedom Tower, rising from ashes," read a CNN headline with a story from John Avlon, the senior political columnist for the Daily Beast and Newsweek. After being corrected via <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>, Mr. Avlon replied: "I'm always going to call it the Freedom Tower."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Sunday, he said via email that referring to it that way "is a defiant matter of pride."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buildings are often retitled when anchor tenants move. But landmarks frustrate attempts at rebranding: The Met Life building on Park Avenue is still the Pan Am building to many, even though the airline ceased operations in 1991. Citi Field replaced Shea Stadium, which was torn down in 2009, yet many Mets fans seem not to have noticed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When it comes to naming buildings, it's actually very difficult to change the name," says James Fox, chief executive of Red Peak Branding. "Names stick."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Chicago's Sears Tower became the Willis Tower in 2009, a national marketing campaign was launched. "We thought we had to make a really big public deal out of it, to get the word out," says Bob Wislow, the chairman and CEO of US Equities, which manages the 4.56-million-square-foot building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, One World Trade Center is no ordinary building. For some, it will forever be associated with the 2001 terrorist attack that killed nearly 3,000 people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Freedom Tower name was coined two years after the attacks by then-Gov. George Pataki as the rebuilding effort slowly moved forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many felt that the name and the tower's height -- 1,776 feet -- were important symbols of the resolve and determination on the part of the American people to fight terrorism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some minds changed as the rebuilding process advanced. Quietly and without fanfare in 2009, the <span class="companylink">Port Authority</span> officially changed the name to One World Trade Center. The old name was considered emotionally charged and some felt that it might hinder the Port's leasing efforts, forever associating the building with the profound loss suffered on Sept. 11.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's an office building and not a memorial and not a monument," says Mr. Durst, who wasn't involved in the renaming but says he supported the change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One World Trade is slated to open to the public and tenants in early 2015. About 55% of the building's approximately 3 million square feet are leased to the media company Conde Nast, the federal government, and a Chinese developer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Durst says prospective tenants today look at One World Trade Center as a modern building at a great location. Security is no more of a concern than at any other building, he says: "Time has gone by and people are concerned about other things."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some refuse to give up the Freedom Tower name, including people who were involved in the site's redevelopment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I always say Freedom Tower," says Daniel Liebskind, the architect who led the redevelopment plan for the World Trade Center site. "The truth is that in the master plan, the notion of a 1,776-foot tower does ultimately refer to freedom."</p>

</p><div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Commercial Property -- Dynasties / A Look at New York's Real Estate Families: Gural Scion on Fast Track</span>
</div><div class="author">By Anjali Athavaley </div><div>1061 words</div><div>24 June 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A24</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the scion of the Gural real-estate family, Jeff Gural has spent most of his career running the family's buildings and helping the growth of the Manhattan brokerage firm <span class="companylink">Newmark Grubb Knight Frank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, he's shifted his attention to his race-track investments: Mr. Gural is majority owner of two tracks in upstate New York and leases another from the state of New Jersey. While he was largely motivated by his love of horse racing when he bought them, he also recognized their investment potential -- especially if casinos were one day permitted on the sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that goal may soon be realized. If Gov. Andrew Cuomo succeeds in getting approval for four new casino resorts in the state, Mr. Gural says he would hope to convert his Tioga Downs racino in Nichols, N.Y., into one of them. "I think I have the best location in the Southern Tier," says the 70-year-old chairman of <span class="companylink">Newmark Grubb Knight Frank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gural says he can pay more attention to his race tracks because he has a deep bench in the New York property business, made up of a younger generation of the family. His son Eric Gural, who is 45, and his nephew Brian Steinwurtzel, 36, both executives at Newmark, have taken over the family's properties in the city. The two have divided the portfolio in half, with Eric mainly focusing on buildings that were acquired in earlier years, Mr. Gural says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeff Gural is still involved with financing issues, because he has relationships with the family's lenders. Otherwise, he jokes: "I just oversee and make sure they don't do anything totally stupid."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The family's portfolio includes 8.5 million square feet of real estate, mostly in the city, worth about $3 billion. The Gurals mainly own office buildings that used to be occupied by manufacturers and are now filled with smaller tenants such as nonprofits and theater companies. The properties are all owned with partners, Mr. Gural says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The family's ties to real estate date back to Mr. Gural's granduncles, Leon and Maurice Spear, of Spear &amp; Co., a brokerage firm, and Aaron Rabinowitz of Fred F. French, a developer. Mr. Gural's father, Aaron, graduated from college with an accounting degree during the Great Depression and took a job at Spear &amp; Co. reading water and electric meters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After going off on his own as a broker, in the 1950s he joined Newmark, where he and his partners started buying commercial buildings in Manhattan, such as the Film Center Building, at 630 Ninth Ave., and 515 Madison, the historic DuMont building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was Jeff Gural and his partner, Barry Gosin, now Newmark's chief executive, who accelerated the pace of acquisitions in the 1970s and 1980s, buying up properties such as 40 Worth St., now the New York offices of <span class="companylink">Gap Inc</span>., and the Dean &amp; Deluca building on Broadway in SoHo, a street that was home primarily to manufacturing tenants at the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We basically changed that whole neighborhood," Mr. Gural says. "That was the first major transformation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their investments are now paying off, family members say. The older loft buildings are becoming increasingly popular with a wide range of tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past decade, the family has focused more on renovating its buildings than acquiring new ones. It's currently working on a project with <span class="companylink">SL Green Realty Corp</span>. to combine 1560 Broadway with a neighboring building to create a bigger retail space. The project, which costs between $50 million and $100 million, is expected to be completed early next year, Mr. Steinwurtzel says. The family is also in the process of doing a gut renovation on a roughly 100,000-square-foot office building at 45 W. 34th St., a $10 million to $15 million project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for Mr. Gural's interest in race tracks, he became interested in horse racing as a teenager. "I used to go to the race track in high school," he says. "It was actually very popular back then. That was the only form of gambling in America."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He runs the Meadowlands Racetrack, a harness racing track in East Rutherford, N.J., where he's spending $100 million to rebuild the grandstand and seating area. He says he is making improvements with the hopes that state law will one day permit a casino there. The family thinks the Meadowlands has the potential to become one of its most successful investments, if casino gambling were allowed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York, the track business isn't a big money maker, Mr. Gural says. Business improved when he converted Tioga Downs and Vernon Downs, located in Vernon, N.Y., into so-called "racinos," which offer high-speed slot machines but no table gambling. But in the case of Vernon Downs, competition has been tough from a full Indian casino five miles away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vernon Downs "was just a mistake," Mr. Gural says. The racino doesn't make money, he says, and a recent agreement with the state that grants the Oneida Indian Nation exclusive rights to casino gaming in the region has sealed its fate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He could have better luck with Tioga Downs, though. Last week, Mr. Cuomo and legislative leaders struck an agreement to authorize four casino resorts upstate if voters pass a constitutional amendment in November to expand non-Indian-tribe gambling. If the amendment is approved, Mr. Gural says he would bid for a casino license.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's no guarantee that effort would be successful. His foray into the racing business upstate was always somewhat of a gamble in itself. "The only way it'll probably turn out to be a good investment is if I'm able to get a casino license at Tioga Downs," he says. "But it's fun."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if it doesn't happen, he says he'll still love the horses. Mr. Gural owns two breeding farms upstate and about 100 horses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you took my father into a casino, he wouldn't make a bet," says Eric Gural, who grew up going to race tracks. "That's not what it's about . . . . He loves racing. He loves the sport."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vacant lots and cranes dangling over half-finished buildings have been among the most visible signs of the region's weak economy, but jobs numbers released Thursday suggested that picture may be improving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The construction industry showed some of the first signs of sustained recovery in May: New York state, New Jersey and Connecticut all added significant numbers of jobs in the sector, even as overall job growth remained spotty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said the growth in construction-related employment was driven by large development projects getting off the ground, stalled sites restarting and an uptick in single-family home construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Connecticut's construction jobs grew 9% this May compared with last year -- much more quickly than the overall private-sector job market, which grew 0.9% over the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're not out of the woods in the housing market, but we are getting there," said Andrew Condon, director of the office of research at the <span class="companylink">Connecticut Department of Labor</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Connecticut issued permits for 337 new housing units in April of this year, compared to 222 the same month last year, according to U.S. Census data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with the upward trend, however, Connecticut has recovered less than half of the jobs lost during the downturn, while New York has gained back all the jobs it lost and more and New Jersey has gained back about 60% of the jobs it lost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Condon said new construction jobs were good news because the overall economic recovery is "highly dependent" on the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York City's construction jobs grew 1.9% in May from April, compared with overall private-sector job growth of 0.4%. May marked the fifth consecutive month in which construction experienced year-over-year growth in the city, after it took a hit immediately following superstorm Sandy, which struck the region Oct. 29.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elena Volovelsky, an economist with the <span class="companylink">New York state Department of Labor</span>, said that could signal that construction was coming back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York Building Congress President Richard T. Anderson said his organization was working on a report, to be released next week, that projects New York City construction employment will reach 130,000 jobs in 2014. That would be the first time construction employment surpassed 130,000 since the 2008 peak of 132,600 jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of residential towers, office buildings and educational and health-care facilities "has come roaring back," Mr. Anderson said. Banks are making more construction loans for residential projects and consumer demand remains strong, he said. "Office buildings that have been on the drawing board longer than anticipated are finally starting to go forward."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A number of stalled condo developments, such as 150 Charles St. in the West Village and 56 Leonard St. in TriBeCa, are moving forward. Large office projects are also starting to progress on the far West Side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall job growth in the city was slow this month, according to Barbara Byrne Denham, an economist at real-estate firm Eastern Consolidated. New York added 3,100 private-sector jobs in May, when the numbers are seasonally adjusted, according to a report she released Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"After adding more than 40,000 jobs in the first four months of this year -- or more than 10,000 per month, on average -- May's small job gain is disappointing," Ms. Denham wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Jersey's construction jobs grew about 5% in May to 134,800 from 128,600 a year ago. That compared with overall private-sector job growth of about 2% in the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jay Grant a home builder and recent past president of the Community Builders and Remodelers Association, said he recently built a new home in Madison, N.J., and had six written offers within two weeks of putting it on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've been in the business for 25 years, I can't remember the last time I had six written offers. I'm not the only builder that's having that experience," Mr. Grant said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Condon, of the <span class="companylink">Connecticut Labor Department</span>, said it was too early to tell whether his state's recovery is solid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Whether or not that is real and sustainable or a result of some of the speculation that some markets are seeing, I don't know the answer to that," he said.</p>
