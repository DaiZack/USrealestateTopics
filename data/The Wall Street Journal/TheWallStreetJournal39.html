<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Los Angeles developer is asking $85 million, one of the highest prices in the U.S., for a 48,000-square-foot mansion in the city's Bel-Air neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seller is Mohamed Hadid, who built many <span class="companylink">Ritz-Carlton</span> hotels in the 1980s and now specializes in constructing massive homes in L.A., Mexico and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hadid says he paid roughly $7.5 million for the land about six years ago and spent another $59 million to build the house (above) for his own use. There's a music room, a library, a ballroom seating over 200 people, a Turkish hammam and a gym, the listing says. The 2.2-acre property also features a pool, a tennis court, a 20-car motor court and seven fountains. Joyce Rey and Stacy Gottula, of Coldwell Banker Previews, have the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Once you finish with your creations, you start to have other ideas," Mr. Hadid says. On a lot near the Beverly Hills Hotel, he's building a 35,000-square-foot chateau-style home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Miami Beach Condo Sold After 54% Price Cut</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What does it take to sell a multimillion dollar condominium in Miami Beach today? A 54% drop from the 2006 listing price, a recent sale suggests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, Al Berg -- who recently sold the company he co-founded, eyewear manufacturer Marchon -- paid $8.6 million for an oceanfront penthouse originally listed for $18.5 million in 2006. Brands manufactured by Marchon, bought last year by VSP Vision Care, include Calvin Klein and Fendi. Former radio executive Scott K. Ginsburg sold the 5,700-square-foot condo, which he'd bought for $2.9 million pre-construction. (That excludes what he paid to finish it.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's a 4,600-square-foot rooftop terrace with a private pool, and an outdoor kitchen. The apartment is in the Il Villaggio building, where producer Jerry Bruckheimer also has a unit. Nelson Gonzalez, of <span class="companylink">Esslinger Wooten Maxwell</span>, had the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Berg lives in New York state with his wife, Gayle, a psychologist, and will use the condo as a second home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ed Bradley Co-Op for Sale</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The widow of journalist Ed Bradley, who appeared for more than a quarter-century on CBS's "60 Minutes," is asking $7.4 million for their nine-room New York apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Central Park West in the St. Urban, a 1906 Beaux-Arts co-operative building, the 3,600-square-foot unit overlooks the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir and has four bedrooms, three bathrooms and a maid's room. Mr. Bradley bought the apartment, which has been on the market since October, in the 1970s. (He and his wife, Patricia Blanchet, owned several homes including a house in the Hamptons.) The building has a doorman, a gym and a basketball court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bradley, co-editor of "60 Minutes," won 19 Emmy awards. He was also one of the first African-Americans to earn a prominent role in network television news. He died in 2006 at age 65.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bridgehampton, N.Y.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first glance it's a gated mansion worthy of a Gilded Age: more than 14,000 square feet with eight bedrooms, 9½ bathrooms, five fireplaces, a pool, a pond, a tennis court and ocean views all nestled amid fields perfect for lavish summer parties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Built on spec, this property was offered for sale in 2006 for $24.95 million. Today? Try $12.95 million -- and even that lower price hasn't yet lured a buyer. The mansion is now being sold at auction as part of a bankruptcy plan by the developer's firm. The manse stands unfinished, forlorn and uninhabited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Tragic," says Andrew Saunders, owner of real-estate agency Saunders &amp;Associates, who adds the house would have sold in 2006 if it had been finished or priced less aggressively. "It was not overpriced. He got caught in economic times," counters A. Mitchell Greene, an attorney for the developer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Welcome to the new Hamptons, where the boom's sunny days and Champagne nights have given way to foreclosure notices and sales at discounts of 25% to 30% and more. Some buyers are making offers of 50 cents on the dollar, and less. Brokers speak of the "Lehman houses" -- homes that used to belong to employees of the fallen Wall Street firm -- or "Madoff homes" -- those owned by clients of the Manhattan financier implicated in a Ponzi scheme. Summer rentals are languishing. "For rent" signs have begun to appear in the windows of some boutiques on Southhampton and East Hampton's tony shopping streets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Mr. Saunders remains a staunch optimist -- he opened his agency in Bridgehampton five months ago -- he is in the distinct minority. For many longtime residents, this is more than a recession. "Jay Gatsby is dead," says Dede Gotthelf, owner of the Southampton Inn, referring to F. Scott Fitzgerald's protagonist from another opulent time, also on New York's Long Island, that came to a sudden end. Ms. Gotthelf, many of whose guests spent $400 to $500 a night last summer, had the worst fourth quarter in her 11 years with the hotel, although she says business picked up recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A ghostly silence has settled on RVS Fine Arts, the Southampton gallery. Owner Roberta Von Schlossberg says in flush years she could easily sell large paintings in a price range of $5,000 and $25,000. Starting in mid-September as the financial crisis hit, she recalls, Jobs Lane became so quiet "you could roll a bowling ball down the sidewalk. Sales have greatly diminished." In Sag Harbor, Elisca Jeansonne, who owns the Gallery Merz, says business "has flatlined." At the entrance of her gallery stands a large painting of goldfish in a bag by Kevin Berlin. Priced at $35,000, it's on sale for $25,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other famous resort towns are suffering. In Aspen, Colo., sales of single-family homes above $1 million fell 44% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, according to Morris &amp;Fyrwald <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>. In the Hamptons, over the past eight years, property values soared to dizzying heights. Once a mecca for artists drawn by the light and natural beauty, the picturesque villages drew wealthy individuals from New York, Los Angeles and Europe. "There were properties that were overvalued more than in your wildest imagination, they were being built and sold for double the price in a couple of years," says Paul Brennan, regional manager for Prudential Douglas Elliman Real Estate. Then last summer, he says, sales stopped. Now, "it is blacker than anyone thought it was going to be." In Southampton, the number of fourth-quarter sales plunged 45%, according to The Real Estate Report Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Prudential's Bridgehampton office, Broker Lynda Ireland spends much of her time now dealing with offers from individuals she calls "investors." "They are putting $1 million to $1.5 million offers on homes that are $3 million to $4 million," the 25-year Hamptons resident says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Ireland herself has been unable to sell a four-bedroom Southampton house she purchased unfinished from a builder in 2006 and put work into it. In 2007, Ms. Ireland put the home on the market for $925,000. The property languished. About four months ago, she rejected an offer of $680,000, sure she could get more. Now, faced with two mortgages and a plummeting market, Ms. Ireland emailed thousands of colleagues and potential customers. "Owner Is Ready to Make a Deal Before They Lose the House," the email read. The note gave a new price: $595,000, which "is still negotiable." She's now entertaining bids at $550,000 -- 41% below her original asking price.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. home building and industrial production plunged last month as the recession puts Americans out of work and slows their purchases of cars and houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A U.S. Commerce Department report Wednesday showed that housing starts in January tumbled 16.8% to a seasonally adjusted 466,000 annual rate compared with the prior month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial production fell 1.8%, with declines in businesses from autos to home electronics to clothing, Federal Reserve data showed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slumping economy is dousing inflation. The U.S. Labor Department reported that import prices fell 1.1% on a monthly basis in January. The drop was the sixth in a row.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This has been largely but not entirely due to plunging energy prices," Insight Economics analyst Steven Wood said. "In addition, weakness in the global economy is dampening non-fuel imported goods prices."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline in housing starts was the seventh straight. The January decrease was bigger than Wall Street had expected. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast a 4.9% drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders have little incentive to put up new homes, with the level of unsold property high. Bloated inventory is driving down prices, as is a rising rate of foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Conditions in the market for new homes have not been this bad since the 1930s, and they continue to worsen," said Patrick Newport, an economist at IHS Global Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's home-starts data said that building permits -- a sign of future construction -- in January decreased 4.8% to a 521,000 annual rate. Michael Darda, an analyst at MKM Partners, said the numbers were bad, but a sharp pullback in starts is necessary to lower inventories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the recession deepened, industries' use of capacity shrank to 72% -- the lowest since February 1983, the Fed report showed. Over the 12 months ended in January, industrial production fell 10%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturing production dropped by 2.5% in January compared with the prior month. Manufacturing of motor vehicles and parts plunged 23.4%; for the year, auto and parts production was down 43.7% as the economy's troubles prompted consumers to forgo large purchases.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Barack Obama's new foreclosure-prevention plan is already sparking outrage from some Americans who won't qualify for federal aid -- and from those who resent having to foot the bill for those who do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What do you expect from the government?" said David Newton, 46 years old, proprietor of DJN Management LLC, which owns 232 rental apartments in the Atlanta area. "The government isn't out there to help people who obey the law and follow the rules."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama "told everybody, 'I'm going to spread wealth around,' and that's what he's going to do," Mr. Newton said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing plan, which President Obama outlined Wednesday in Phoenix, will allow homeowners who have little or no equity to refinance their homes, something that has been nearly impossible to do under current rules. It also establishes standards for government-subsidized loan modifications for borrowers in subprime loans and endorses a provision that would allow bankruptcy judges to reduce the principal on primary residences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While real-estate professionals applauded the refinance provisions, which the White House says could help four million to five million homeowners, lots of borrowers wouldn't be eligible. For example, the refinance provision is limited to borrowers whose mortgages are owned or securitized by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> or <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the government-backed mortgage companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That essentially shuts out wealthy borrowers who would like to refinance but can't because they own expensive homes financed with so-called jumbo mortgages, which are too large to be owned by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Rosenberg, a 44-year-old institutional stock broker in Chicago, has been trying to refinance his $815,000 option adjustable-rate mortgage for months. But his bank is requiring him to put an additional $150,000 of equity into his home, something he is reluctant to do because his income has been cut in half over the past year. For jumbo borrowers, he said, the government's message is, "You're on your own." Mr. Rosenberg saw little consolation in the president's initiative. "The only recourse I will have is a bankruptcy judge."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress has endorsed a provision that would allow bankruptcy judges to modify all types of loans. The White House's proposal would limit such write-downs to existing mortgages under <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> loan limits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some borrowers in hard-hit markets say they also are excluded. That is because the foreclosure-mitigation plan allows borrowers with little or no equity to refinance a first mortgage for up to 105% of the property's current market value. For some affluent borrowers heavily underwater in markets like California, that isn't enough. "We can afford to make our payments, so no one is going to help us," said Jill Wong, who has watched the value of her Modesto, Calif., home drop to around $350,000, from the $605,000 she paid four years ago. That wiped out her 20% down payment and has left her with a mortgage that has a 125% loan-to-value ratio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Wong said she is considering walking away from her current residence since she doesn't expect that the home will ever recover its value. "What's to stop me?" she said. "Years ago you would have thought it was immoral."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing measures have also upset a range of homeowners who say they shouldn't have to subsidize those who bought more than they could afford. "We've lived a conservative life," said Tim O'Brien, 61, a retired CPA from Los Angeles. "We've paid our house off and saved our money, so you kind of find yourself on this issue not agreeing with everything."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. O'Brien believes that Mr. Obama's approach will prove inflationary -- a hardship for those, like him, on fixed incomes. "It's kind of like they've chosen the bloc they want to support with the packages and we're going to end up paying for a lot of it through the losses we've suffered in the market and through inflation over the next 10-15 years," he said as he worked on a project restoring an 80-year-old, two-masted wooden schooner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The White House says even those who don't benefit directly could benefit indirectly if the effort boosts the housing market and lifts the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brenda Gilchrist said she feels like she is being punished twice, first by watching foreclosures depress the value of her three-bedroom condominium in Santa Rosa, Calif., and now by subsidizing borrowers who bought more than they could afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price of her condo has fallen to the mid-$300,000 range, down so far from the $510,000 that she and her husband paid for it four years ago that their 20% in equity is gone. She said they decided to buy a less expensive home even though they had qualified for a $1 million loan. "We said, 'Absolutely, no way.' We chose to buy within our means," said Ms. Gilchrist, a 39-year-old managing partner of a human-resources firm. "The 'good guys' are getting a raw deal," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim Stoll, 67, of Stafford, Va., said tax cuts would be more equitable. "I look at all the spending in this bill, and I don't see it going to the normal taxpayer," said Mr. Stoll, who spent 26 years in the Marine Corps and an additional 16 in civil service. "If they have to spend money, then it would be easier to put it in consumers' pockets and let them do with it what they will," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others are skeptical that the plan will work. "Twelve months down the road they're going to say, 'We're going to need to throw another $50 billion at the problem,'" said Mr. Newton, the Atlanta property owner. "They should just foreclose on the properties, auction them off on the courthouse steps and see who buys them."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Conor Dougherty </div><div>637 words</div><div>19 February 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Real Estate; A2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts plunged to new lows in January as a large number of vacant homes, tight mortgage financing and a deepening recession created the worst housing market in a half-century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, a report on industrial production showed that a broad collection of manufacturers cut back in January, as falling sales and mounting inventories forced them to reduce worker hours and shut down factories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two reports echoed what has been an emerging theme in the past few months: Makers of goods and homes are slashing production as fast as they can to match falling consumer and business demand. "There is nothing in these reports that says we are remotely close to turning around," said Nigel Gault, an economist at forecasting firm IHS Global Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts fell 16.8% in January from a month earlier, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 466,000 units, the lowest in at least 50 years, according to the Commerce Department. It was a dismal number in an already dismal housing market, and the drastic cutback by home builders will weigh down the economy further and likely result in the loss of more construction jobs. Still, the steep falloff in new-home starts could set the stage for a faster housing recovery, because it keeps down the amount of inventory that has to be sold before a recovery can take place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The regional trends hinted that construction could be close to bottoming out in some places hit hardest by the housing recession. States in the West and South -- which in general had the most overheated housing markets and were the first to see falling prices and construction -- saw home starts fall much less than in the Northeast and Midwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts fell 6.4% in the West and 12.8% in the South, indicating that home builders there could be nearing a bottom. The Northeast and Midwest, where home prices fell later, saw starts fall 42.9% and 29.3%, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of housing construction has set record lows in each of the past three months, and some economists don't think it can go much lower. The fourth quarter of 2008 and first quarter of this year "will probably be the quarters in which housing starts fell more sharply than at any other point in the housing downturn," Abiel Reinhart, an economist at <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;Co</span>., wrote in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report from the Federal Reserve Wednesday showed that overall industrial production fell 1.8% in January, as makers of everything from cars to T-shirts produced less to match falling demand. But in many cases, inventories continue to pile up, as consumers struggle under the weight of the economy and tighter credit, and businesses cut back on investment. The global economic slowdown has crimped exports, which had been a bright spot for the economy in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the few categories that saw a rise in output was energy, which economists attributed to cold winter weather that kept heaters and stoves burning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the sharpest declines was in the auto sector, which accounted for much of the drop in the manufacturing sector. The auto industry has seen a steep dropoff in sales, as the recession and tighter credit have caused consumers to forgo big purchases. Light-vehicle production fell to an annual rate of 3.7 million units in January, 42% below the month-earlier level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Labor Department said Wednesday that overall import prices fell 1.1% in January, the sixth consecutive monthly decline. Most notable to economists were nonfuel prices, which fell 0.7% in January, following declines in each of the previous four months.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Conor Dougherty </div><div>636 words</div><div>19 February 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts plunged to new lows in January as a large number of vacant homes, tight mortgage financing and a deepening recession created the worst housing market in a half-century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, a report on industrial production showed that a broad collection of manufacturers cut back in January, as falling sales and mounting inventories forced them to reduce worker hours and shut down factories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two reports echoed what has been an emerging theme in the past few months: Makers of goods and homes are slashing production as fast as they can to match falling consumer and business demand. "There is nothing in these reports that says we are remotely close to turning around," said Nigel Gault, an economist at forecasting firm IHS Global Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts fell 16.8% in January from a month earlier, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 466,000 units, the lowest in at least 50 years, according to the Commerce Department. It was a dismal number in an already dismal housing market, and the drastic cutback by home builders will weigh down the economy further and likely result in the loss of more construction jobs. Still, the steep falloff in new-home starts could set the stage for a faster housing recovery, because it keeps down the amount of inventory that has to be sold before a recovery can take place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The regional trends hinted that construction could be close to bottoming out in some places hit hardest by the housing recession. States in the West and South -- which in general had the most overheated housing markets and were the first to see falling prices and construction -- saw home starts fall much less than in the Northeast and Midwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts fell 6.4% in the West and 12.8% in the South, indicating that home builders there could be nearing a bottom. The Northeast and Midwest, where home prices fell later, saw starts fall 42.9% and 29.3%, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of housing construction has set record lows in each of the past three months, and some economists don't think it can go much lower. The fourth quarter of 2008 and first quarter of this year "will probably be the quarters in which housing starts fell more sharply than at any other point in the housing downturn," Abiel Reinhart, an economist at <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;Co</span>., wrote in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report from the Federal Reserve Wednesday showed that overall industrial production fell 1.8% in January, as makers of everything from cars to T-shirts produced less to match falling demand. But in many cases, inventories continue to pile up, as consumers struggle under the weight of the economy and tighter credit, and businesses cut back on investment. The global economic slowdown has crimped exports, which had been a bright spot for the economy in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the few categories that saw a rise in output was energy, which economists attributed to cold winter weather that kept heaters and stoves burning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the sharpest declines was in the auto sector, which accounted for much of the drop in the manufacturing sector. The auto industry has seen a steep dropoff in sales, as the recession and tighter credit have caused consumers to forgo big purchases. Light-vehicle production fell to an annual rate of 3.7 million units in January, 42% below the month-earlier level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Labor Department said Wednesday that overall import prices fell 1.1% in January, the sixth consecutive monthly decline. Most notable to economists were nonfuel prices, which fell 0.7% in January, following declines in each of the previous four months.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Katherine Boehret </div><div>1129 words</div><div>18 February 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Gadgets &amp;Games; D3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dipping a toe into the real-estate market these days can feel a lot like taking your car to the mechanic: If you don't know what you're doing and don't trust the professional you hired, you may feel like someone is taking advantage of you. Thankfully, the Web's ability to demystify intimidating topics has brought what was once considered insider real-estate knowledge to the masses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, I tested Trulia.com, a real-estate site that's geared toward helping people who are ready to buy. Trulia combines a simple approach to real estate that anyone can grasp, with enough market stats to excite number-crunching types. It also offers a community where regular users can ask 200,000 real-estate professionals questions without fear of being hounded by agents because their emails are hidden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trulia has been around since 2005, but started out as a site that only posted local real-estate listings in California and New York. After expanding to the national market in 2006, it added other features like pricing heat maps (color-coded to indicate prices in an area), comparable listings, an online community and automatically generated newsfeeds about specific properties and areas. Last summer, Trulia went mobile with a free iPhone app that uses GPS to find nearby open houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starting Wednesday, Trulia will offer CompareIt, a tool that lets users choose five properties for sale to directly compare with one another. Before now, Trulia just generated a list of comparable properties that sold or are for sale at the bottom of a listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I only used Trulia for a week, and I'm not a typical buyer since I was just looking -- for now. But I got a lot out of the site, especially by browsing maps of neighborhoods that I know well (I'm picky about my preferred location) and asking questions of the Trulia community. Its iPhone app listed nearby open houses according to my search criteria and also worked on my iPod touch as long as I was in a Wi-Fi zone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another big plus to Trulia is Newsfeed, a list that shows up on the home page with content that's automatically generated and personalized according to your past search locations. It is updated every day and spits out stats like the number of price reductions, open houses and new listings in an area. It shows an area's average listing price, median sales price, number of foreclosures and average price per square foot, among other things. These data are a boon for people who don't have the time or inclination to look this stuff up, and it aggregates the data into one intelligible, quick snapshot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I found some flaws in Trulia, like the way it accidentally listed a property that was sold five months earlier. Trulia said it relies on partners for accurate listings, and those partners get their data from Multiple Listing Services or local brokers and agents, therefore Trulia's data are only as good as its partners'. (At least one other real-estate site also accidentally listed the already-sold condo for sale.) Another problem occurred when I tried to use the CompareIt chart on Washington, D.C., properties; Trulia said the tool doesn't work for D.C. due to a bug that it hopes to fix. Finally, properties saved on the iPhone app won't transfer to your Trulia Web site account. The company says it hopes to fix the iPhone issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of Trulia's competitors is Zillow.com, which displays its own price estimates for all houses in the U.S. (for sale or not) to give people an idea of the real-estate value in an area. The two sites are similar in some ways: Both show heat maps, display data about nearby schools, have mortgage calculators and use online communities to answer questions. But Zillow doesn't offer a stat-packed Newsfeed or an iPhone app like Trulia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After browsing through Trulia, I found a variety of properties that suited my target price range and location preferences. One place had lots of big windows and a renovated kitchen, according to the photos and information listed on its detailed Trulia Web page. A shortcut on the page made it easy for me to share this place with three friends to see what they thought. I even posed a question to the Trulia community about the property: Does this unit have a private entrance, or does it share an entrance with the five other units in the building?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ironically, this was the property that was already sold, as I found out when a real-estate agent responded to my question. It took him just 15 minutes (Trulia says this is within five minutes of the average response time) to post a response saying that he was familiar with the listing and that the place sold five months earlier. Trulia has since updated this property's status.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other questions that I asked of the community were answered within 20 minutes. In one instance, I asked a general question about the best time of year to buy in Washington, D.C., and three real-estate agents responded almost immediately; two were from my area and offered their advice -- and their services -- but one from Florida chimed in simply to offer some encouragement. Each responder was clearly identified with a name, classification (i.e. real-estate pro) and photo. Within a couple hours, four more people responded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These questions and answers are shared with everyone on Trulia, and I clicked on a thumbs-up icon to vote for the answer I found most helpful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Email alerts can be set up through Trulia so you're notified if a property you like dips below a certain price, or if there are new blog posts about certain categories like financing, crime or environmentally friendly properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The CompareIt tool worked to see how properties (excluding those in D.C.) stacked up against one another, up to five at a time. These charts arm people with more statistics and (likely) more negotiating power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real-estate world can be intimidating, now more than ever. Though sites like Trulia won't solve this problem completely, they could make the weighty decision of buying a house a little bit easier.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jeff Bater </div><div>466 words</div><div>17 February 2009</div><div>14:48</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Economy</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The confidence of U.S. home builders, while still in the dumps, managed something in February it hasn't done in five months: It rose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Home Builders released Tuesday results of a monthly survey of builders' thoughts on market prospects. Its latest index for sales of new, single-family homes climbed to 9, up from an all-time low of 8 in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last time the housing market index, or HMI, showed an increase was September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But conditions are awful. The latest government data show new-home sales dropped by about 15% to 331,000 in December. Year over year, sales were around 45% lower. Builders don't want to break new ground because the market is awash in unsold property. Bloated inventories are driving down prices. Falling prices, in turn, and a recession that's throwing people out of work have combined to undercut demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market for new single-family homes remains very weak at this time," NAHB Chairman Joe Robson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress has approved a $787 billion plan to stimulate the slumping economy. The legislation includes an $8,000 first-time home buyer tax credit. Builders hope the package excites moribund demand for housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Looking forward, we are certainly hopeful that the newly passed economic stimulus bill, which includes some favorable elements for first-time home buyers and small businesses, will have a positive impact that will help get housing and the economy back on track," said Mr. Robson, a builder from Tulsa, Okla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A component within the housing market index that measures current sales conditions rose to seven during February, up from six. An index gauging traffic of prospective buyers rose by three points to 11. But the index gauging sales expectations in the next six months fell to a new record low of 15 from 17.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home builders are especially concerned about the continually rising number of foreclosures and short sales, which are flooding the market with excess inventory and undermining overall home values," said David Crowe, NAHB's chief economist. "This is one reason that home builder expectations for the next six months declined in the February HMI even though traffic of prospective buyers has improved somewhat and present sales conditions were basically unchanged."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAHB's overall housing market index for February was based on a survey of 421 home builders, who answer questions about sales prospects now and in the near term. When the Housing Market Index exceeds 50, it means the number of builders who see "good" sales outnumber the number who see "poor" sales. The numbers used in compiling the index are adjusted for seasonal variations.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Alison Tudor </div><div>797 words</div><div>13 February 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Real Estate; C3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TOKYO -- <span class="companylink">American International Group Inc</span>. has a hidden jewel that it is about to put on the market: its Japanese headquarters overlooking the Imperial Palace here, which sits on some of the most expensive real estate in the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AIG has asked investment bank <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span>, now part of <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>., to help sell the 15-story building, according to Eric Martinez, the chief restructuring officer for AIG Global Real Estate. The building could fetch more than $1 billion, other people said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale would go toward repaying U.S. taxpayers for a bailout in September. AIG is selling assets to help repay a loan of as much as $60 billion it received from the government as part of the federal rescue. It had $38.6 billion outstanding as of Feb. 4.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The insurer has found it difficult to unload some businesses partly because it has been hard to value complex financial instruments. A building might be easier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Tokyo building is the highest-profile property that has been put on the block by AIG Global Real Estate, which manages some $20 billion in property around the world for investors and AIG's own account. Other properties that AIG is shopping include a Marriott hotel and an office building in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and a business park in Dubai.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AIG also is preparing to test the market with five medical office facilities in the U.S. Southwest. AIG is also selling its entire real-estate funds business, which managed about $12 billion in assets as of September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts say the financial crisis hasn't hit Japan's property market as hard as other commercial centers. What's more, the recent rise in the value of the yen against the dollar means any sale in Japan would be worth more when the price is calculated in dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AIG set up shop in Japan in the aftermath of World War II at the request of Gen. Douglas MacArthur. He wanted an American firm to insure his occupation troops in Tokyo, so he arranged for AIG to break into the market, overturning a ban on the entry of foreign insurers at that time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The insurer chose a building, near Gen. MacArthur's headquarters, rebuilt in 1975 and recently updated to exceed seismic regulations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A buyer may choose to knock the building down and build a bigger structure on its footprint of almost one acre. This will be relatively easy because the leases for all 25 tenants run out in 2010. Roughly 1,000 people work in the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There has been a lot of buyer interest from Japan, Asia and other parts of the world," said Kevin Fitzpatrick, president of AIG Global Real Estate Investment Corp. in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During Japan's real-estate bubble in the 1980s, some estimated the square mile of land underneath the Imperial Palace to be worth more than the entire state of California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now, like property markets around the world, Tokyo is seeing rising vacancies and falling land prices, though the deterioration isn't as fast or severe as elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices are tricky to estimate as there have been few large transactions in the last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lot hinges on whether a buyer can get financing. Large Japanese real-estate developers have an advantage, as they may still be able to get loans from Japanese banks or lean upon their group companies' corporate borrowing relationships.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If a grade A office building were to go on the market in central Tokyo soon, then the purchaser would most likely be one of the big Japanese groups," said Andy Hurfurt, executive director at real-estate-services firm <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the U.K's Serious Fraud Office said Thursday that it has launched a preliminary inquiry into the U.K. operations of <span class="companylink">AIG Financial Products Corp</span>., a unit of AIG.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The office said it is cooperating with the Financial Services Authority and with U.S. authorities conducting separate investigations. The office said the inquiry doesn't pertain to AIG's insurance operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AIG said that it "will cooperate fully" with the office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AIG disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in November that it "understands" some employees have received Wells notices in connection with investigations related to the unit. A Wells notice says the SEC may seek approval from its commissioners to bring an enforcement action. The recipient can submit responses in an effort to persuade the agency not to pursue the proposed charges.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stanley Chais, who funneled funds to Bernard Madoff, listed his Los Angeles condominium for sale last week for $4.7 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Chais, 82 years old, ran an exclusive investment pool his clients nicknamed "The Arbitrage." He placed the money with the alleged Ponzi-scheme financier. Mr. Chais is facing lawsuits from investors over their losses, including Oscar-winning screenwriter Eric Roth, who's been nominated again for "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button." Mr. Chais's attorney, Eugene Licker, says that his client is a victim of Mr. Madoff's fraud and has personally lost millions in the scandal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Chais and his wife, Pamela, bought the apartment about two years ago for $4.4 million. It's in Sierra Towers, a well-known 1960s era high-rise off of the Sunset Strip with a pool, gym and valet service. The 3,800-square-foot unit on the ninth floor has two bedrooms, four bathrooms, a chef's kitchen and a balcony.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Chais has moved to New York, according to Mr. Licker. The couple is offering to lease the apartment for $28,000 per month. Coldwell Banker's Guy Levy and Linda May, have the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trader Raises Aspen Price</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trader John Devaney, whose fund was an early victim of the subprime-mortgage meltdown, has sold off some key assets since then -- but he's raising the price on his 17-bedroom Aspen, Colo., home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, Mr. Devaney raised the price to $23.5 million from $21.5 million last year. Mr. Devaney's listing agent, Joshua Saslove, of Joshua &amp;Co., an affiliate of Christie's Great Estates, says the new price reflects Mr. Devaney's improvements, including a pool and the rewiring of lighting on his huge Christmas tree, a local landmark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2006, Mr. Devaney and his wife, Selene, bought the property, then a bed and breakfast, for $16.25 million. Known as the Sardy house, it's one of the largest homes in downtown Aspen. Several of Mr. Devaney's hedge funds collapsed in 2007, and the funds' assets were seized by lenders. He continues to run <span class="companylink">United Capital Markets Inc</span>., a specialist in distressed assets based in Key Biscayne, Fla. He declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Onetime Spy's Home for Sale</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Washington, D.C, the onetime home of a World War II spy is on the market for $1.95 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agent -- Betty Thorpe Pack, codenamed Cynthia -- was an American who spied for the British in Washington during World War II, seducing and obtaining secrets from diplomats, according to "Cast No Shadow," a biography by Mary Lovell. After the war, Mrs. Pack moved to a chateau in France. She died in 1963.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sellers of the three-bedroom, three-bath house in Georgetown are Hans Wyss, a former World Bank staffer, and his wife Edith. Ann Hatfield Weir and Heidi Weir, of Washington Fine Properties, have the listing.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Los Angeles</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High in the Hollywood Hills, in a posh enclave called Mount Olympus, Sara Weinheimer gazes out her bedroom window, which overlooks the sparkling lights of the city down to the Pacific Ocean. Cypress trees dot the horizon and birds chirp from the garden, where a pool and tennis court are connected by winding stone paths flanked by rose bushes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I feel like I am living in the sky," says the 53-year old documentary film producer. At night Ms. Weinheimer says she leaves open the bedroom's four floor-to-ceiling doors, flanked by champagne silk curtains, and falls asleep to the sound of owls. In the morning the sunrise streaks the city and her walls orange and pink.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a view worth millions -- that rents for much less. The three-story stucco is on the market for $5 million. But in the meantime Ms. Weinheimer pays $15,000 a month -- about $12,000 a month less than the home would cost to own, assuming a 6.5% mortgage, 35% down, taxes, insurance and maintenance. She recently negotiated the rent down from $20,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this recession, perhaps the only market falling as fast as luxury home sales is luxury home rentals. In Seattle, a waterfront home appraised by two agents at $15 million is for rent for $10,000 a month, down from $14,000 a month ago. In San Francisco, a Pacific Heights Georgian owned by Kirk Hammett of rock group Metallica, went on the market for $14,000 a month. It had been on the market for $9.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While these rents could hardly be called low, in some cases they wouldn't even cover the taxes and maintenance cost of the homes. "At least they're paying the utilities," says Richard Goodwin, of renters who recently snapped up his newly constructed Aspen home, estimated to be worth $5 million, for $4,000 a month. Mr. Goodwin, who had originally wanted $10,000 a month, says he's hoping the renters will eventually want to buy the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Canaan, Conn. real estate agent Lawrence Story has "been in the business 30 years and I have never seen anything like this." He says there are 22 rental listings for $9,000-to-$20,000 a month, more than double the number a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently, rents across the country had held firm, benefiting from the housing crash as people elected to rent rather than buy. But apartment rents (home rents aren't tracked) fell nationwide in the fourth quarter of 2008 for the first time since 2003 and are expected to fall by 1.7% in 2009, a projection larger than any annual figure on record, according to <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>., a New York City real-estate research company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a normal housing market, lower home prices usually lure renters into buying, says Nela Richardson, an economist at the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University. As the available pool of houses available for rent shrinks, rents begin to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this isn't a normal market. Agents and economists say falling prices have yet to lure buyers, due in part to higher vacancies and inventory bloated by new construction. Tight credit -- especially for larger homes -- is also dampening sales. Rentals.com -- which includes both homes and apartments -- saw a 21% increase from March 2008 through January 2009 in the number of listings asking at least $2,000 a month. "Landlords are more willing to lower both asking and effective rents very quickly," says Victor Calanog, director of research for Reis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rental rates of luxury homes have come down so much they're sometimes an affordable option to luxury hotel rates. Salvatore and Marisa Carpanzano were living at the <span class="companylink">Ritz-Carlton</span> in White Plains, N.Y. while they looked for a house to buy in Scarsdale. In December they jumped at the chance to rent a $1.8 million five-bedroom home in Scarsdale when its rent was reduced to $8,000 from $10,000 a month. "It was too good a deal to pass up," says Mr. Carpanzano, who works at an oil processor. The couple says they're going into contract this week to buy another house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Weinheimer moved to the Hollywood Hills from Bedford, N.Y., with her husband Tom Pura, a retired <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> partner, in August 2007, so their son, a nationally-ranked junior tennis player, could play year-round and Mr. Pura could work on "50,000 Balls," a documentary about junior tennis champions and their families. They planned to leave after their son finished high school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Ms. Weinheimer first saw the Hollywood Hills house "I just fell in love with it," she says. All the bedrooms have balconies, and the master has an infinity tub and a dressing room with six closets. There are eight fireplaces and a third floor room with a 360 degree view.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mr. Pura died unexpectedly of a heart attack last July, Ms. Weinheimer started looking at other properties. That's when she noticed rents had come way down since they'd looked in early 2007. Rather than move, she decided to ask the owner to reduce her rent. "I wanted to stay but I thought I was paying too much," she says, sipping Jasmine tea on an orange U-shaped mid-century modern sofa with a clear view of Catalina Island, the walls colored with paintings by Broadway choreographer Tommy Tune and other artists. Owner Jason Vogel says the market came into discussion, but he reduced the rent because of the death of Ms. Weinheimer's husband. He says he still thinks the house could get $20,000 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Weinheimer isn't just a renter -- she's a also prospective landlord. While still trying to sell her Bedford, N.Y. estate for $4.75 million, she's also trying to rent it for $15,000 -- and says she might be willing to negotiate.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Michael Corkery </div><div>557 words</div><div>12 February 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builder <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers Inc</span>. reported more bad housing news on Wednesday, including signs that its bet on the once resilient New York City real-estate market is producing some bad apples.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With mortgage credit still tight for high-end homes and the region's financial industry shedding jobs, Toll has been slashing prices for some of its flashy Brooklyn condos by as much as 25% and battling to prevent buyers from walking away from contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We still have a whole lot of people working on Wall Street and in the banking industry who probably won't be there in the next year," Chief Executive Robert Toll said during a conference call with analysts on Wednesday. "So over the next few years, I would think New York is going to be soft."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll's New York blues were among many dour notes the company struck in recapping preliminary results for its quarter ended Jan. 31.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Horsham, Pa., company said home-building revenue slumped 51% to $409.3 million and write downs could total as high as $200 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll's sales in its latest quarter were grim. Across the country, orders fell 59% from a year ago to just 266 homes, a larger decline than some analysts expected. They plummeted 70% in the North, followed by 63% in the Mid-Atlantic and 56% in the South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll also acknowledged that a much-touted 3.99% mortgage interest-rate promotion had been used by only two dozen buyers since the builder started offering the rate last month. Mr. Toll said another promotion offering buyers additional rooms and appliances at big discounts was more successful than the cut-rate mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York condos had been a rare bright spot for the primarily suburban builder. But now some of its New York developments have fallen victim to the financial-market turmoil. The company began sales at a 128 unit tower in Manhattan in October, as the stock market swooned and investment firms, such as <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc</span>., imploded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a development in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, Toll recently cut the list price on a three-bedroom condo to $894,990 from $1.2 million, a 25% cut. Toll says it is dropping prices on some units to move inventory at its Northside Piers building, which is 60% occupied. Toll has started selling in an adjacent tower, which has a greater proportion of smaller, less expensive units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll looked smart when it unveiled its first Manhattan condo tower in late 2006, hoping to attract a buyer that Mr. Toll referred to as "hedge fund Johnny," a young, financial services worker. At the time, the New York City housing market continued to roar, even as formerly hot suburban markets such as Florida and California were collapsing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the fourth quarter, home-sales contracts in Manhattan declined more than 50% from a year ago and supply increased 39%, according to Miller Samuel, a New York real estate research and appraisal firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Anyone would have expected some pullback in New York, but no one would expect it to be this dramatic," says Daniel Oppenheim, a housing analyst at <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>. "At this time, any exposure to the city is too much."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON -- Nicholas Candy, who sells luxury apartments to the super-rich, recently showed off a $41 million, four-bedroom property here that boasts a private swimming pool and a life-size statue of a boy, encrusted in Swarovski crystals, with his middle finger raised.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the brand of conspicuous consumption that Mr. Candy and his brother and business partner Christian marketed to wealthy clients is being put to a severe test by the economic crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From London to New York to Dubai, the luxury residential market is hurting as the economic crisis deepens. Plunging property prices are making even the wealthy who still have money to spend nervous about buying. Property specialists say it may be at least a couple of years before demand recovers significantly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S., luxury condo sales have taken a nosedive in recent months as prices have fallen and job losses have begun to take their toll in the upper ranks of a wide range of businesses. Some projects in Miami have been forced to sell in bulk at fire-sale prices. Sales have fallen well short of targets at the Trump International Hotel and Condominium in Chicago. In New York, where there have been tens of thousands of job cuts on Wall Street, prices of luxury units have fallen 15% to 25% since last summer, brokers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past decade, the Candy brothers became splashy emblems of London's boom and the extravagant lifestyles it spawned. Nicholas, 36 years old, and Christian, 34, rocketed to celebrity status here by selling luxury apartments, often as a second or third home, to the international billionaire crowd that flooded into London from Europe, the Middle East and Asia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The brothers' property development business, CPC Group Ltd., has helped change London's landscape with towers of glass and modern blocks in the center of the U.K. capital. Their high-end portfolio includes One Hyde Park in Knightsbridge, where an apartment sold last year for about $148 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the brothers are emerging as a barometer of whether overseas wealth can continue propping up the city's luxury market. Much of the foreign money has gone into retreat or been wiped out during the global financial crisis -- downsizing the lifestyle of the wealthy Russians, Middle Easterners and other foreigners who made up much of the Candys' customer base and causing the London real-estate market to fall, property specialists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November, the Candy brothers undid their biggest deal by agreeing to sell their share in a prominent central London development. They are now trying to save their first overseas development, a high-profile project in Beverly Hills, Calif., where the brothers plan to build luxury condominiums but have defaulted on a $365 million loan and are scrambling to restructure it. They have given up a stake in another London project in exchange for a greater share of the U.S. site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The brothers' problem is twofold. Overseas buyers accounted for about 26% of purchases of London's high-end real estate in 2007, according to British real-estate company <span class="companylink">Savills PLC</span>, but that dropped to less than 20% in 2008, in a market that was half the size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, prices are plummeting. Prices in London's high-end real-estate market -- typically houses valued at about $1.5 million or more -- plunged 8.7% during the last three months of 2008, according to Savills. That compares with a 3.9% drop during the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2008. The market for houses with an average value of about $7.3 million declined by an even wider margin, falling 9.6% in the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Candy brothers say they can ride out the downturn. CPC Group has about $300 million of cash, they say, and their business interests are set up to prohibit the failure of one development project from affecting the others. They say that one of their highest-profile developments, One Hyde Park, is on track for completion next year and they have a healthy interior-design business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's tough times across the board," says Nicholas Candy, who acknowledges "challenging times ahead." But he adds, "we put ourselves in a very strong financial position."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Candys created the property equivalent of a designer label around their last name. The brothers, neither of whom are married, socialize with the wealthy set they sell to and say they count the likes of Ivanka Trump and Prince Albert of Monaco among their acquaintances. Based in Monaco, the Mediterranean tax haven where they moved to a few years ago, they jet between London, New York, Los Angeles, Dubai and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sons of an advertising executive, they grew up in middle-class Surrey on the outskirts of London. Nicholas, the more gregarious of the two, went into marketing while Christian became a commodity trader. On the side, they made their first property deal in the 1990s, using a loan of about $8,870 from their grandmother as a deposit on a London apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They began buying and selling properties, decorating them along the way. In 1999, they launched Candy &amp;Candy Ltd., decorating the homes of wealthy Londoners. Their trademark look: black floors, minimalist furniture, lavish flourishes such as $5,800-a-roll, hand-stitched, silk wallpaper and oversized plasma screens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Software entrepreneur Martin Edmondson, 40, bought a three-bedroom apartment in Knightsbridge from the Candys about five years ago. He says he liked the dark-walnut interior and "cool gadgets," including a fingerprint reader to open the front door. An added attraction: The apartment came fully decked out, down to bed linen, cutlery and silver toothbrushes in the bathroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They were creating a lifestyle," says Louise Hewlett, a managing director at real-estate agent Aylesford International Ltd. In the U.K. real-estate business, "no one had done it in that way."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The brothers took on increasingly ambitious property deals via CPC Group, the business founded by Christian Candy -- plowing ahead as the real-estate market swelled. In 2006, they teamed up with Iceland's <span class="companylink">Kaupthing Bank hf</span> to buy a three-acre site in London's bohemian Bloomsbury neighborhood with plans to build some 180 luxury apartments, calling the project Noho Square.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keen to expand into the lucrative U.S. market, they signed their first overseas development deal in 2007 after a broker introduced them to the Beverly Hills site. Partnering again with Kaupthing, they paid $500 million for an eight-acre plot between Wilshire and Santa Monica boulevards, which only four years earlier had traded hands for less than $50 million. They named it 9900 Wilshire and drew up plans for some 240 luxury condominiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The brothers' other key source of finance came from Qatar, a small oil-producing Persian Gulf emirate. Following an introduction by a banker, the Candys teamed up with the Qatari prime minister, Sheik Hamad Bin Jassim Bin Jabr Al-Thani, to develop a six-unit luxury apartment building in London's affluent Belgravia neighborhood. Later, they again secured the prime minister's backing for the massive One Hyde Park development, near Harrods department store in Knightsbridge. An assistant to the prime minister referred questions to an official at the Qatar Investment Authority, who declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as the real-estate market slowed, the Candys pressed ahead. Early last year, they partnered with the Qatari government's real-estate arm, <span class="companylink">Qatari Diar</span>, on their biggest deal yet, paying $1.4 billion to acquire a 13-acre, former army barracks site in Chelsea. To celebrate, the brothers hosted a party in Cannes on their 148-foot yacht Candyscape -- with acrobats and stilt-walkers as entertainment -- even as they fended off opposition to the project from Alexander Macmillan, grandson of former Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, who described the glass-towered development as "an abomination."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Undeterred, the brothers in September moved their staff to sleek new offices overlooking the River Thames, where a wall of 32 plasma screens descends in an L-shape from the black-marble lobby to the floor below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within days of moving into the new offices, however, U.S. investment bank <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc</span>. collapsed. That sent markets reeling -- wiping out billions of dollars of net worth from the likes of the Middle Eastern wealthy and Russian oligarchs who make up the Candys' client base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The impact on the real-estate world was immediate. The market for such ultra-high-end apartments, which cost tens of millions of dollars, effectively froze, with some buyers even walking away from deposits, according to property specialists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, the brothers were left sitting on plans for several hundred apartments, most of which had not even been built. At One Hyde Park -- the ongoing project that is furthest along -- about half of the 80 apartments, which cost on average tens of millions of dollars or more, have been sold. And those have only been paid for in part, the Candys say. The Candys haven't made any new sales in the past few months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're getting a few offers on things, but in reality, everyone is sitting on their hands," says Nicholas Candy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dressed in a black Gucci blazer and white shirt, Mr. Candy recently toured the vast One Hyde Park construction site. Looking over the site's four unfinished "pavilions," Mr. Candy said they have sold enough apartments in the development to pay back the construction loan -- assuming all the clients that have already paid deposits do pay in full.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, he adds, raising money to build new properties will be almost impossible. "Construction finance across the world has completely dried up," he says, before stepping into a black chauffeur-driven car where his brother waited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Oct. 9, the credit crisis claimed one of the Candys' key financial partners -- <span class="companylink">Kaupthing Bank</span>, which was nationalized by the Icelandic government. That same day, CPC Group and Kaupthing were due to repay the loan on the Beverly Hills site. The Candys say they had the funds to pay their $160 million share, but were forced to default with their partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nicholas and Christian Candy tried to take full control of both the Beverly Hills site and another they jointly owned with Kaupthing, Noho Square in London. They cited a clause in the contract that allowed them to take over in the event that Kaupthing went into some form of liquidation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But their Kaupthing banker, Mike Samuels, fought back saying the bank wasn't insolvent, it had been nationalized, so that clause didn't apply. Mr. Samuels proposed instead that the Candys swap their equity stake in Noho Square for Kaupthing's share of the Beverly Hills project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The brothers agreed to the swap in late October. They lost more than $3 million on Noho Square but the swap left them owning 90% of the Beverly Hills project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We still maintain a good working relationship with CPC and Candy &amp;Candy," said Mr. Samuels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November, the brothers also agreed to give up their stake in the Chelsea barracks site to <span class="companylink">Qatari Diar</span>. The Candys say they will remain involved as development managers among other roles and that CPC still made money on the project. "We've taken our profit today instead of in years to come," says Nicholas Candy. "I try not to get emotional about property."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Candys still face losing the Beverly Hills project if they can't restructure the debt or produce additional funds to the lending group, which includes <span class="companylink">Banco Inbursa SA</span>, the Mexican banking group led by billionaire Carlos Slim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christian Candy, along with other CPC Group representatives, has been shuttling to New York and Beverly Hills to meet with representatives of the lending group to negotiate restructuring the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CPC Group has proposed injecting funds in exchange for an extension of a reduced loan, according to a person familiar with the matter. But it is unclear whether differences over the amount of fresh capital, among other details, can be bridged, this person says. Even if the Candy brothers can strike a new financing deal, they may still need to reconfigure the project to make it economically viable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Candys say they hope to get the deal done. Even if they don't, it won't jeopardize their other projects, they say. If they ultimately lose the site, it won't put them out of business, they say. "We just lose a lot of money," says Nicholas Candy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ever-bullish Candys say they already are thinking about their next move. They say they haven't canceled orders for two private jets, a helicopter and a bigger yacht. Still, even they are making some adjustments. "My brother and I are not buying new jets today," says Nicholas Candy. "We are waiting to see what happens in 2009."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an attempt to boost sales in a dismal market, homebuilders are turning to what has been one of the most overlooked aspects of a house: improving the way it uses energy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the sales results are mixed so far, industry experts say the move could eventually boost business as more cost-conscious consumers seek to save on rising power bills by having a more efficient home. Already, builder Kevin Enyeart, in Lee Springs, Mo., says he has picked up two contracts and possibly a third over the past six months to sell homes to buyers who specifically requested energy-saving features, such as better insulation and tighter-fitting windows. That's rare good news in a market Mr. Enyeart says is so bad that he has had to cut the number of homes he builds to about 20 a year from 40.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I used to be a pessimist about going green, but not anymore," Mr. Enyeart says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the shift may be altering the fortunes of so-called green homes, which often include environmentally friendly building materials and energy-saving features. In recent years, when home prices were high, green homes were a tougher sell because builders tended to charge a premium for them. But now that home prices have dropped, green homes are more attractive, both because the premium has been substantially reduced and because people are more interested in saving money on energy costs over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energy efficiency, in particular, has emerged as a top priority for consumers because power bills have more than doubled in many markets. When asked to list their top 12 influences in buying a home, consumers responding to a National Association of Home Builders survey last year put energy efficiency at No. 2 , behind quality of living space. Five years ago, energy didn't even make the same survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Debbie Swank, a 37-year-old financial planner, says energy savings played a "huge role" in the decision by her and her husband to buy a four-bedroom house by <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> in Austin, Texas, in December 2007 that the company touted as energy efficient. The two-story, $379,000 home includes features such as a radiant barrier roof to reflect the sun's heat and a dual-thermostat cooling system that adjusts the temperature so each floor can get only the air-conditioning it needs. As a result, the couple and their two boys, ages five and eight, have cut their power bills by more than half -- from a high of $400 a month before to a high of $192 now -- even though their new home is 600 square feet larger. "We love the savings," Ms. Swank says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The industry's new focus on energy efficiency was evident at the International Builders Show in Las Vegas last month. Green materials such as bamboo floors and carpeting made from recycled material of all stripes have been featured at past builders' shows, but this year they seemed to dominate the green space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the housing market remains so bad -- single-family starts this year are expected to fall to a record low, after diving 40% last year -- that any sales generated by energy-efficient homes are unlikely to help the industry much for now, industry officials say. Indeed, assistant vice president Carlos Martin says he has received reports of green builders going out of business along with traditional builders in some markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Credit is also so tight that many builders can't afford the extra 2% or so of a building's costs it can take to go green, or be able to pass it on to customers. In Missouri, Mr. Enyeart says it costs him about $3,500 more after credits and other offsets to build an energy-efficient home, forcing him to transfer funds from his marketing budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, nascent results are encouraging, builders say. In Las Vegas, <span class="companylink">Pulte Homes Inc</span>. reports "very good traffic" at a subdivision it opened a few weeks ago where the homes have been outfitted with energy-saving features designed to keep power bills under $100 a month in the summer heat. The homes are among hundreds the Bloomfield Hills, Mich., builder has constructed across the country as part of a "Builders Challenge" issued a year ago by the Department of Energy for the industry to build 220,000 ultra-efficient homes by 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere, Dallas-based Centex Corp. this month launched the "Centex Energy Advantage," in which all new homes will include features such as an energy monitor the occupant can use to adjust usage of furnaces and such. <span class="companylink">KB Home</span>, meanwhile, said that beginning Jan. 1, all of its new homes would be built under strict standards of the Environmental Protection Agency's Energy Star program. KB officials said the move was aimed, in part, at competing better against sales of existing homes, which usually don't include many energy-savings features. "Anything that helps their [consumers] pocketbook has a lot of value," says Jeffrey Mezger, chief executive officer of the Los Angeles-based builder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dozens of other builders have signed up for energy-efficiency and other green programs that have been started up in the industry in recent years. Building products giant <span class="companylink">Masco Corp</span>., for instance, reports between 40 and 50 large builders have signed up for an Environments for Living Certified Green program it sponsors that emphasizes energy efficiency, compared to just 10 two years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You don't want people to be afraid of heating and cooling their homes," Pierre Le Pendeven, a custom builder from Claremont, Calif., said after standing in line to tour an energy-efficient show home sponsored by Masco Home Services Inc., a unit of Taylor, Mich.-based <span class="companylink">Masco</span>, at the International Builders Show last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some builders are also moving into the remodeling market to retrofit existing homes to use energy better. Claremont, Calif., builder Devon Hartman says he recently used an infrared camera to help a wealthy homeowner in Los Angeles identify numerous places where air was leaking out of his 7,000-square-foot mansion. Mr. Hartman is now helping to seal the home, which he expects will reduce its energy usage by two-thirds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And companies that sell energy-savings products are benefiting. <span class="companylink">Johnson Controls Inc</span>. of Wichita, Kan., has seen a "double digit" increase in sales to builders of devices that modulate the flow of heat out of a furnace to save energy, says Tom Huntington, a company vice president. Even companies whose sales have gone down because of the housing market report energy-saving products have helped cushion the fall. Los Angeles-based PlastPro Inc. said its sales of energy-efficient residential doors -- designed to hold in warm or cool air twice as efficiently as traditional ones -- fell 15% last year from a year earlier, as single-family housing starts plunged a much steeper 40%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, business at wood-products giant <span class="companylink">Georgia-Pacific LLC</span> has generally been in a funk. But officials of the Atlanta-based company say sales of its new XJ 85 Joist -- a beam engineered to contain 40% to 50% less wood, and leave space to run air conditioning and heating ductwork through homes more efficiently -- are taking off. Since unveiling the product three months ago, Georgia-Pacific officials say they are selling upwards of 60,000 feet of it a week now, or enough to fill four trucks. "You can't see it," says Michael Rehwinkel, president of Georgia-Pacific's wood-products business, "but it's what you don't see that matters in the green story."</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Signs of Life in Southwest Florida; Amid the dismal news from Fort Myers there are signs that at least some buyers are starting to pursue deeply-discounted homes</span>
</div><div class="author">By June Fletcher </div><div>761 words</div><div>12 February 2009</div><div>09:56</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Real Estate</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Credit is the lifeblood of the economy," said President Obama yesterday at a town hall meeting in Fort Myers, Fla. Nowhere is that more true than where he said it -- a resort region that's largely dependent on the out-of-town residents who buy second homes there, and the industries that support them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Southwest Florida has been among the most hard-hit areas of the country by the credit crunch, largely because it benefited so greatly from the freewheeling credit boom that preceded it. And yet there are signs that at least some buyers are starting to pursue deeply-discounted homes, particularly in ritzier enclaves on or near the waterfront.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When I bought my three-bedroom condo in 2004 in Naples, Fla., a few miles south of Fort Myers, out-of-town speculators, second-home buyers and even real estate agents were snapping up homes so quickly that many remained on the multiple listing service for only days or even hours. Mortgages were being handed out so readily that my loan officer from Countrywide waved away the sheaf of tax returns and other evidence of creditworthiness I'd brought to his office. "I just need your FICO score for approval," he said, tapping my Social Security number into his computer. In less than five minutes, I had my loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fast forward five years, and the situation is upside down—as are the loans of many home owners who bought during those heady years. Prices in Lee and Collier counties, home to Fort Myers and Naples, have dropped 44.6% and 29.3% respectively since 2006, according to a report released on Tuesday by Integrated Asset Services, a Denver default mortgage services and valuation firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While I'm not underwater—yet—things look scary. The <span class="companylink">Circuit City</span> in the brand-new strip mall down the street went out of business only a few months after its grand opening; so did a nearby restaurant, furniture store and picture frame shop. Meanwhile, my next-door neighbors, who have been trying to sell their condo since they learned they were expecting a baby, recently dropped their price from $350,000 to $299,000. They had to—their new baby is starting to crawl.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My neighbors say that they've had a lot of traffic to their condo, which is in great shape and a short distance to the beach, but haven't been able to sell, partly because buyers are having trouble getting loans. It's not surprising, given how tight credit standards have become not only for investors and vacation home buyers, but also for primary-home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Southwest Florida, the locals have it worse than out-of-towners, even though home prices have become more affordable. Because their incomes are so dependent on purchases from tourists and seasonal residents, year-round residents have been experiencing some of the highest unemployment rates in the country, hovering around 10%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The high unemployment rate, coupled with high inventory levels, are among the reasons that <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com expects housing in Southwest Florida will lag the rest of the country in recovery, not bouncing back until the end of next year [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123395798979258411.html].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders like Northern Trust, a private bank catering to high-net-worth individuals seems to be reaping the benefit of its conservative practices. Northern Trust never altered its lending strategies during the boom, always requiring proof of cash flow and 20% down. John Fumagalli, president and chief executive officer of the Collier County division of the bank, says that average loan volume actually increased from 2007 to 2008, though he won't disclose by how much. "It feels like things are starting to improve," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it's axiomatic that only those with jobs and enough cash to meet today's stringent lending requirements will find conventional financing, Christopher Spina, a real estate broker in Bonita Springs, Fla., says that many buyers overlook other possibilities, such as government-sponsored loans from the Federal Housing Administration, the United States Department of Agriculture, and state and local agencies. Buyers should check with a variety of lenders. "Loan programs are changing all the time," he says. With competition for buyers fierce, some sellers are also offering private financing or lease-option deals, which may be a solution for buyers with damaged credit.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">For Toll, Bet On Big Apple Turns Sour</span>
</div><div class="author">By Michael Corkery </div><div>561 words</div><div>12 February 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Real Estate; B1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builder <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers Inc</span>. reported more bad housing news on Wednesday, including signs that its bet on the once resilient New York City real-estate market is producing some bad apples.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With mortgage credit still tight for high-end homes and the region's financial industry shedding jobs, Toll has been slashing prices for some of its flashy Brooklyn condos by as much as 25% and battling to prevent buyers from walking away from contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We still have a whole lot of people working on Wall Street and in the banking industry who probably won't be there in the next year," Chief Executive Robert Toll said during a conference call with analysts on Wednesday. "So over the next few years, I would think New York is going to be soft."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll's New York blues were among many dour notes the company struck in recapping preliminary results for its quarter ended Jan. 31.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Horsham, Pa., company said home-building revenue slumped 51% to $409.3 million and write downs could total as high as $200 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll's sales in its latest quarter were grim. Across the country, orders fell 59% from a year ago to just 266 homes, a larger decline than some analysts expected. They plummeted 70% in the North, followed by 63% in the Mid-Atlantic and 56% in the South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll also acknowledged that a much-touted 3.99% mortgage interest-rate promotion had been used by only two dozen buyers since the builder started offering the rate last month. Mr. Toll said another promotion offering buyers additional rooms and appliances at big discounts was more successful than the cut-rate mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York condos had been a rare bright spot for the primarily suburban builder. But now some of its New York developments have fallen victim to the financial-market turmoil. The company began sales at a 128 unit tower in Manhattan in October, as the stock market swooned and investment firms, such as <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc</span>., imploded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a development in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, Toll recently cut the list price on a three-bedroom condo to $894,990 from $1.2 million, a 25% cut. Toll says it is dropping prices on some units to move inventory at its Northside Piers building, which is 60% occupied. Toll has started selling in an adjacent tower, which has a greater proportion of smaller, less expensive units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll looked smart when it unveiled its first Manhattan condo tower in late 2006, hoping to attract a buyer that Mr. Toll referred to as "hedge fund Johnny," a young, financial services worker. At the time, the New York City housing market continued to roar, even as formerly hot suburban markets such as Florida and California were collapsing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the fourth quarter, home-sales contracts in Manhattan declined more than 50% from a year ago and supply increased 39%, according to Miller Samuel, a New York real estate research and appraisal firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Anyone would have expected some pullback in New York, but no one would expect it to be this dramatic," says Daniel Oppenheim, a housing analyst at <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>. "At this time, any exposure to the city is too much."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, even as her friends bought huge houses in the expensive Phoenix market, Elizabeth Child remained a renter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in January, the airline customer-service agent and her boyfriend closed on their first home. The three-bedroom, two-bath house, complete with granite countertops and a pool, had been listed for $340,000 in late 2007, but the couple bought it for $220,500. "Six months ago I didn't think I would own a home," says Ms. Child, 27 years old. "And now I do. It's so perfect."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing bust is creating a new group of winners: first-time home buyers. People who sat on the sidelines -- often watching wistfully as their friends became homeowners -- are suddenly in a position to grab some great deals. Indeed, first-time home buyers made up 41% of all buyers at the end of 2008, up from 36% in 2006, according to a recent survey from the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new buyers are being lured in by home prices that are down about 25% from their peak levels in mid-2006, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Schiller Index. In some markets, prices have dropped even further -- slumping around 40% in Phoenix, Miami and Las Vegas. Lower mortgage rates have also helped make real estate more affordable, and as houses languish on the market longer, more homeowners are willing to negotiate. With Congress considering plans to sweeten a tax credit for first-time home buyers, the picture could get even brighter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Buyers are now coming back into those hard-hit markets to take advantage," says Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the Realtors' association. "It's a buyer's market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ululani and Scott Larson looked for a house in the Seattle area several years ago, but held off from buying, deterred by the high prices. "I felt like we were missing out, because everyone knows it's the American dream to buy a home and build equity," Mrs. Larson says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple was shocked to discover recently that they could afford a four-bedroom home in Federal Way, Wash. The assessed value of the home in January was $400,000, Mrs. Larson says. Their offer of $315,000, with a down payment of $15,000 was quickly accepted by the relocation company, which had had the property on the market for six months. "Honestly, I didn't think we'd get as nice of a house as we did," Mrs. Larson says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, would-be buyers need decent credit scores and the money for a decent down payment. Also, finding the right property can be a challenge for first-time buyers, who tend to be seeking less-expensive homes. The typical first-time buyer purchased a home costing $165,000 last year, according to the National Association of Realtors. Yet some of the best bargains right now are in luxury condos and sprawling single-family houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The disproportionate McMansion inventory doesn't work," says Shari Olefson, a real-estate lawyer who works in southern Florida. "Even if you qualify for the loan, there are huge overhead costs to buying a larger home."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, real-estate agents and mortgage lenders are banking on first-time buyers to help stimulate the otherwise dreary housing market. Many are holding workshops and information sessions designed specifically for first-time buyers, addressing federal and state tax incentives for homeowners, local prices and ways to take advantage of low mortgage interest rates. Tim Epps, a mortgage adviser in Tulsa, Okla., runs rent-vs.-buying simulations for would-be buyers and recommends that other prospective buyers do the same long-term calculations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Epps and many mortgage lenders recommend that buyers come up with as big a down payment as possible, even though Federal Housing Administration loans will allow some first-time buyers to enter the market with as little as 3% down. (Hud.gov has more information about FHA loan programs designed for first-time buyers.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Even if [a home owner] loses some paper equity, in the long run, there are some tax benefits," says Mr. Epps, referring to the deduction for interest paid on mortgages and the credit for first-time home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $7,500 tax credit for first-time buyers, which Congress passed last year, has had little effect on the market so far. Because the credit has to be repaid, buyers are viewing it as another loan, industry experts say. But the stimulus package that Congress is working on is likely to repeal the provision that requires buyers to pay the credit back and possibly enlarge the tax credit as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many buyers, the biggest question is whether to hold out for even better conditions. Historically, recoveries in the housing market are slow, and most experts expect the prices to stay low for some time. That means people can take their time shopping for the right property, real-estate experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Stratton, an agricultural engineer in Lisle, Ill., was serious about buying last summer but held off from making a bid. Some of the money he planned to use for a down payment suffered losses from mutual-fund investments. He's also waiting for prices in his area to go down further. "I can do better investing in things other than real estate," he says. "Right now, I'm not diving in."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patience can pay off. Jen and Drew Rocky spent over a year tracking their prey before the price was right. In the summer of 2006, they saw the four-bedroom, 2½-bathroom home of their dreams in Sherman, Conn. The asking price was $565,000, "completely out of our price range," Mrs. Rocky says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But they didn't give up. The Rockys kept driving by the vacant house. They had online alerts to notify them of changes in the property's listings. They went to town hall to research the home's public records. As they suspected, the home was in foreclosure. "There were liens all over the place," Mrs. Rocky says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They bought the home in December 2007 for $410,000. "I felt so vindicated," Mrs. Rocky says. "We got a good deal, but I'm sure there are even better deals out there."</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Inventory of Homes For Sale Declines</span>
</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>524 words</div><div>10 February 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes listed for sale declined in many metropolitan areas in January, a month when the supply normally increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of homes available for sale in 29 major metropolitan areas at the end of January was down 2.5% from a month earlier, according to figures compiled by ZipRealty Inc., a real-estate brokerage firm based in Emeryville, Calif. The ZipRealty data cover all single-family homes, condominiums and town houses listed on local multiple-listing services in metro areas where the firm operates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a national basis, inventories typically rise sharply in January after the holiday lull. Over the past 25 years, the average increase in January from the prior month has been 8.7%, though the supply has occasionally declined during January, according to Ivy Zelman, chief executive of Zelman &amp;Associates, a research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A shrinking supply is a positive sign for housing demand, but it probably doesn't mean a rebound is at hand. Ms. Zelman doesn't see any near-term recovery for the market. She said the latest data reflect price-cutting by banks that has helped them clear more foreclosed homes off the market. She added that homeowners who don't have an urgent need to sell are keeping their homes off the market amid falling prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patrick Lashinsky, chief executive of ZipRealty, noted that inventories in December didn't shrink as much as usual. Sellers hoping to move in the summer may have put their homes on the market in late 2008 rather than waiting for January or February as usual because they know houses are generally taking longer to sell. Potential buyers are being very picky and spending more time looking, Mr. Lashinsky said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another provider of housing-market analysis, Altos Research LLC, says the number of listings in its 10-city composite index declined 3.3% in January from the prior month. Compared with the year-earlier month, the January inventory in the 29 metro areas covered by Zip was down about 13%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, about 3.7 million previously occupied homes were listed for sale at the end of December, according to the National Association of Realtors. That is enough to last about nine months at the current sales rate. A six-month supply has long been considered a rough balance between supply and demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These inventory data don't capture the entire housing supply, however. Newly constructed housing and foreclosed homes, a big part of the supply, aren't always included in Realtors' multiple-listing services. In addition, many people have taken their homes off the market in the hope of getting a better price later. Those homes will come back on the market eventually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Zip data don't cover New York City. But Miller Samuel Inc., an appraisal firm there, reports there were 9,627 cooperative apartments and condominiums on the market in Manhattan at the end of January, the highest level in the past decade. That was up 6% from December and up 36% from January 2008.</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>530 words</div><div>10 February 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Real Estate; D4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes listed for sale declined in many metropolitan areas in January, a month when the supply normally increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of homes available for sale in 29 major metropolitan areas at the end of January was down 2.5% from a month earlier, according to figures compiled by ZipRealty Inc., a real-estate brokerage firm based in Emeryville, Calif. The ZipRealty data cover all single-family homes, condominiums and town houses listed on local multiple-listing services in metro areas where the firm operates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a national basis, inventories typically rise sharply in January after the holiday lull. Over the past 25 years, the average increase in January from the prior month has been 8.7%, though the supply has occasionally declined during January, according to Ivy Zelman, chief executive of Zelman &amp;Associates, a research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A shrinking supply is a positive sign for housing demand, but it probably doesn't mean a rebound is at hand. Ms. Zelman doesn't see any near-term recovery for the market. She said the latest data reflect price-cutting by banks that has helped them clear more foreclosed homes off the market. She added that homeowners who don't have an urgent need to sell are keeping their homes off the market amid falling prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patrick Lashinsky, chief executive of ZipRealty, noted that inventories in December didn't shrink as much as usual. Sellers hoping to move in the summer may have put their homes on the market in late 2008 rather than waiting for January or February as usual because they know houses are generally taking longer to sell. Potential buyers are being very picky and spending more time looking, Mr. Lashinsky said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another provider of housing-market analysis, Altos Research LLC, says the number of listings in its 10-city composite index declined 3.3% in January from the prior month. Compared with the year-earlier month, the January inventory in the 29 metro areas covered by Zip was down about 13%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nine-Month Supply</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, about 3.7 million previously occupied homes were listed for sale at the end of December, according to the National Association of Realtors. That is enough to last about nine months at the current sales rate. A six-month supply has long been considered a rough balance between supply and demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These inventory data don't capture the entire housing supply, however. Newly constructed housing and foreclosed homes, a big part of the supply, aren't always included in Realtors' multiple-listing services. In addition, many people have taken their homes off the market in the hope of getting a better price later. Those homes will come back on the market eventually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Zip data don't cover New York City. But Miller Samuel Inc., an appraisal firm there, reports there were 9,627 cooperative apartments and condominiums on the market in Manhattan at the end of January, the highest level in the past decade. That was up 6% from December and up 36% from January 2008.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">See Corrections &amp;Amplifications item below [cx].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A proposed tax credit for home purchases is raising the hopes of the real-estate industry, which believes the credit could be just the stimulus needed to stabilize the housing market and get hesitant buyers to take the plunge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A provision included in the Senate version of the stimulus bill would provide a tax credit for 10% of the purchase price of a home, up to a maximum $15,000. The provision faces an uncertain future even if the stimulus passes in a Senate vote set for Tuesday. The measure would have to win backing from the House, which last week voted to repeal a provision that requires an existing $7,500 tax credit to be repaid over 15 years. That credit, which has income limits, applies only to first-time home buyers, who last year accounted for about 40% of all buyers, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea behind the broader Senate plan is to lure fence-sitting potential home buyers like John Westerdale, a 47-year-old information-technology worker who has been shopping for a home for a year but has been reluctant to finalize a deal because of falling home prices. Sunday, he planned to visit a four-bedroom home listed at more than $500,000 in Ringwood, N.J., and said that if the credit is included in the final package, he'll speed up his plans to make his first home purchase. The tax break, he says, could help offset the possibility of further declines in home values. "The problem is, if you buy a house you'll have lost value in two months," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say the credit could help buyers get over that worry. "This is triage," says Mark Zandi, chief economist of <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com. "We're in a runaway elevator trying to put on the brakes...and this can help change the psychology in the marketplace."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Home Builders and the National Association of Realtors began aggressively promoting the tax credit last fall as part of a lobbying effort, which received a big boost when it was embraced by leading Senate Republicans last week. Congress last year approved the $7,500 credit for first-time buyers that had to be paid back over 15 years. But consumers weren't excited about the plan, and housing executives say it didn't spark many sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current proposal has strong support from consumers. At real-estate firm <span class="companylink">Long &amp;Foster Cos</span>. in Chantilly, Va., Web-site traffic has increased fourfold over the past month and managers report a big uptick in interest from clients who want to go under contract if the tax credit is approved, says company president David Stevens. He sees the tax credit boosting sales among first-time and "move-up" buyers who have been sitting on the sidelines for years and could benefit from low home prices and interest rates.</p>

How It Works       The tax credit is refundable, which means that even buyers who don't owe any federal income tax will receive a check. Modifies an existing tax credit to eliminate repayment provisions.The tax credit is nonrefundable, which means that buyers can only claim the credit if they owe income taxes. Buyers can claim the credit on two years of tax returns.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Now is not the time to buy for everybody, but if you're sitting on the sidelines expecting to wait longer to buy that perfect home...you have a layering of opportunity" if the tax credit passes, he says. Some economists say that without any effort to stimulate demand from buyers and eliminate a supply backlog, prices will continue to fall, triggering more defaults as more homeowners lose equity. That creates a self-reinforcing process, whereby banks that hold mortgage-related securities take more losses and tighten credit, slowing the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even some landlords, who could see their tenants leave to buy homes, support the approach to boost demand. "You need to get the housing market back on its feet because it's dragging us all down," says Richard Campo, chief executive of <span class="companylink">Camden Property Trust</span>, a Houston-based apartment owner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the measure has its share of critics who say Washington shouldn't be spending billions that largely benefit homeowners with equity in their homes, and upper-middle-income borrowers who have stable incomes and good credit. "The biggest beneficiary of this is whoever owns a home today at a price where they're unwilling to sell," says Thomas Lawler, an independent housing economist in Leesburg, Va. He and others say the real focus should be on stemming foreclosures, which are flooding the marketplace with price-destroying competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And because the Senate tax credit is nonrefundable, it wouldn't benefit buyers who don't owe any income tax or who have a low tax liability. About 38% of Americans owe nothing on their federal income taxes. "It's basically a giveaway -- an unnecessary windfall -- to higher-income people," says Sheila Crowley, president of the National Low-Income Housing Coalition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mounting job losses, rising credit-card defaults and tighter lending standards also could counter efforts to jump-start home sales. Jeff Jacobs says he is prepared to speed up his plans to move out of his Westerville, Ohio, condominium and into a larger home with his wife and 7-month-old daughter. But the 28-year-old urban planner isn't sure he would be able to qualify for a loan after losing his job late last year, and he wonders if he could sell his three-bedroom condo. "If the credit comes along, maybe we could get some buyers in here," he says.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And they're off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hammerson has stolen a march on U.K. real estate rivals by becoming the first to launch a rights issue to raise fresh equity from shareholders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while the City office and retail park developer's 584 million pounds $872 million) capital boost will buy it some respite, it won't put an end to its problems if property values continue to plummet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chief Executive John Richards estimates the company would risk breaching its covenants even after the rights issue if values were to fall a further 25%, representing a peak to trough fall across the portfolio of 54%. That's not beyond the realm of possibility. Hammerson's portfolio fell in value by 20% in the last twelve months, of which 14% came in the last six months. Falling values saw the company's gearing rise sharply to 118% at the end of December from 77% at the end of June. That compares with a covenant trigger of 150%. The rights issue will reduce gearing to 81%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The quality and geography of Hammerson's portfolio will provide some insulation against further falls. While a 50% peak to trough drop across the <span class="companylink">Investment Property Databank</span>'s benchmark index is widely expected, Hammerson's properties in France, where values haven't fallen as steeply, and the prime nature of its U.K. properties which have historically outperformed IPD, suggest it won't follow suit. The company said it will also continue trying to dispose of assets to reduce its debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, Hammerson and its underwriters <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> and Citi are not taking any chances with its seven for five rights issue. The new shares are being issued at a 62% discount to Friday's closing price of 397 pence and a 39% discount to the theoretical ex-rights price, despite getting the support in advance of Hammerson's top 10 shareholders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the current market conditions and with other real estate rights issues anticipated in the coming weeks, such caution on the part of the underwriters is probably wise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those looking to follow Hammerson's lead, speed is crucial. Property values are falling so fast that the U.K. Listing Authority may force companies to revalue their portfolios ahead of a rights issue if they feel the latest valuation figures are already out of date. That could string out the process and increase costs. Expect a flurry of real estate rights issues in the next few weeks as companies report their year end asset values.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Catching Some Rays; Condos and apartment buildings have proved resistant to solar power. That's starting to change.</span>
</div><div class="author">By Yuliya Chernova </div><div>1397 words</div><div>9 February 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>In-Depth Reports</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The benefits of solar power are starting to spread beyond the single-family home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For legal and practical reasons, installations of solar power have largely bypassed buildings with multiple residential units. Laws in most states, for example, require each solar-power system to have only one meter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such laws, devised in large part to prevent the rise of rival power suppliers, also prevent different users in the same building from sharing a system. Individuals in condo or co-op settings who want their own solar, meanwhile, face other obstacles such as limited roof space and the hassle of getting approval from other residents or boards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, however, surging interest in solar power has led legislators and utilities to revise some of these laws and to create innovative utility programs that encourage using solar power in multifamily dwellings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It only makes sense. Utilities can benefit because solar power can reduce heavy electricity loads and help prevent outages. There's also a question of equity: In many places, apartment and condo dwellers pay higher utility bills to help cover the cost of solar-rebate programs, even when they can't take advantage of those programs themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Solar has long been thought of as an elitist resource, says Shaun Chapman, East Coast campaigns director for Vote Solar Initiative, a San Francisco-based nonprofit promoting solar legislation in the U.S. The challenge now, Mr. Chapman says, is, "How do we get it to everyone?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The California Public Utilities Commission has taken a step in that direction with a new ruling, set to take effect next month, that will make it easier for affordable-housing properties to install solar power in multifamily buildings. As a system produces power, its electricity feeds into the larger grid. The utility company measures that power and awards credit to the electricity bills of each unit in the building. A tenant's credit depends on the size of his or her unit. This type of arrangement is known as virtual net metering, because instead of using individual meters, the utility uses a space-based or another formula to estimate each customer's power usage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owners of the affordable-housing developments will pay for installation but can recover their costs by charging renters a flat monthly fee -- if the project helps reduce the tenants' utility bills. Owners will benefit, too, from lower costs for common areas, like hallways. To help pay for the installation, owners earn credits based on the size of common areas. Those savings can also help keep rents down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Serving Many Goals</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These multifamily-tenant buildings are ideal sites for solar," says Curtis Seymour, energy adviser for the California PUC. "Opening up the market to a broader sector of customers," he adds, benefits all California residents by serving "the aggregate goals of the state, to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and to increase renewable energy production."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Seymour says the commission has received many inquiries from owners of multifamily buildings -- not just in affordable housing. He says the commission will consider extending the program to regular multifamily housing, since renters in apartment buildings could also reap savings and credits in their individual utility bills. Similarly, landlords who install solar could recover their costs through monthly fees or small rent increases, and make their buildings more attractive to renters seeking environmentally friendly apartments and lower electricity bills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The one-meter, one-system rule shows signs of eroding in other states as well. Some that allow net metering, however, limit tax rebates for installations to relatively small systems. Pennsylvania, for example, has a cap of 50 kilowatts -- power for about a dozen apartments -- on systems eligible for rebates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York State Incentives</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York state is giving condominium and co-operative owners a reduction on their state income tax if their buildings install solar power. The rebate allows 25% of a system's cost to be divided among the owners. The same tax break is granted for installing solar power in single-family buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We get several calls per week from co-ops and have five to 10 proposals outstanding," says Richard Klein, president of New York-based solar-installation company Quixotic Systems Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. Energy Group, a real-estate and energy-conservation company in New York, is buying a 24.85 kilowatt solar-power system to power common-area lighting and other electricity use in its six-story 120-unit co-op building in Fresh Meadows, N.Y. "I intend to do this in every building," says Gerald Pindus, chief executive of U.S. Energy Group, which owns 15 buildings with a total of about a thousand apartments in the New York metropolitan area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city of New York, for its part, this year began offering a property-tax abatement of 8.75% a year for four years, up to $62,500 a year, for buildings that install solar. The abatement can be applied in addition to the state tax break.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Community Power</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Massachusetts, meanwhile, the new Green Communities Act, which went into effect in July, requires utilities to allow "neighborhood net metering," which would permit residents of several housing units to band together to be co-owners of a solar-power system and use the power produced to offset their individual bills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same concept is being explored in other states, as well, including New Jersey, Virginia and Colorado. "The multifamily solar issue is as a subset of the larger and more important issue of community solar," says Kevin Fox, an attorney with Keyes &amp;Fox LLP, a Seattle-based law firm that specializes in distributed-power-generation law. The biggest challenge in getting people to use solar is "the high upfront cost and the long-term commitment," Mr. Fox says. Partaking in community solar can lower that long-term commitment threshold, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A community effort in Sacramento, Calif., meanwhile, predates the utilities commission's ruling on solar for affordable housing. The <span class="companylink">Sacramento Municipal Utility</span> District since July 2008 has encouraged use of solar power in multifamily properties by letting the residents buy some of their electricity from a central one-megawatt solar-power system. To participate, customers pay a fixed monthly fee starting at $10.75 for a 0.5-kilowatt share, based on their power usage. Then, each month, they receive a credit on their electricity bill; the credit amount is determined by how much power the solar plant has produced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The utility says this program, which it calls SolarShares, has proved more popular than a rebate program for solar installations on roofs of single-family houses. While 90% of the one-megawatt system had received subscriptions from 574 customers, as of Dec. 19, the utility says it had subscribers for only 210 kilowatts of rooftop solar through its rebate program as of the same date, according to Rachel Huang, who manages SolarShares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, participants in SolarShares have seen their utility bills rise, because the monthly fee is higher than the reduction they receive for solar energy their system produces. But Ms. Huang says this may change over time. Once you buy into SolarShares, she explains, your fee will stay steady and the same number of kilowatt-hours will be cancelled from your electricity bill. Meanwhile, the value of each kilowatt-hour cancelled will rise because rates will have risen. According to Ms. Huang, customers eventually may wind up making a profit by participating in the program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sacramento utility devised the program in such a way that subscription fees are lower for those who use less energy, reversing one of the typical benefits of solar, which is that users see a quicker return on their initial investment the more energy they use. SolarShares charges higher fees to the bigger users to cover the costs of transmitting the power to the building and other costs of running the program. When solar panels are installed directly onto a building, by contrast, the transmission costs are next to nothing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Los Angeles is proposing to implement a similar program, which city officials hope might account for 100 MW of solar by 2020. Similar programs, on a smaller scale, are already in place in Ashland, Ore., and Ellensburg, Wash.</p>

</div><div class="author">By June Fletcher </div><div>557 words</div><div>6 February 2009</div><div>16:02</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Real Estate</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In more than three decades of real estate reporting, I've noticed that recessions have at least one silver lining: They force builders to compete harder. The result is that some concepts that were once merely show-off features in blue-sky idea homes start to show up in real-world tract homes. Once that process starts, there's no turning back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So I was delighted to attend the opening of what was billed as the "innovative" universal design show home a few days ago in Clarksburg Village, Md. While there wasn't too much that was new conceptually in the 3,700-square-foot home, built by Winchester Homes, what was new was the builder's willingness to incorporate ergonomic features in every home it builds -- not, like most builders, just in ones targeted to seniors. "We're getting to the spot that 'wow, this could be a market for us,'" says Vince Mendel, divisional sales manager for the Bethesda, Md.-based company. "We want people to know we've arrived, we get it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The arrival for Winchester comes more than two decades after the principles of universal design were popularized by the late Ron Mace, a wheelchair-bound North Carolina architect, who tried to get builders to make houses more functional for everyone at every stage of life and ability. Still, the company is in the vanguard of builders offering all of its customers such common-sense features as lowered light switches, varied counter heights, raised electrical outlets and showers stalls without thresholds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reasons why these changes haven't caught on have less to do with aesthetics and building codes and more to do with simple inertia. New homes were selling easily, and builders didn't feel the need to tinker with their floor plans, even though they added little or nothing to the cost of the home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes in age-restricted communities were the exception, but this never made much sense to me. After all, wider doorways and lower thresholds not only help wheelchair-bound seniors but also young parents pushing strollers and handling groceries. And first-floor water turnoffs, low-level lights along stairways and double-banisters are such obvious, low-cost safety improvements they should have been standard features in all homes years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, not all elements of universal design can be incorporated cheaply. Eliminating outdoor stairs to a front door requires extra foundation work to lower the basement floor so a proper ceiling height can be maintained, thickening foundation walls to keep out termites, and adding porches or overhangs to prevent water intrusion. High-tech features like touchless faucets and doorbell flashers cost more than their standard counterparts, too. So buyers should expect to pay more for homes that are totally accessible to the handicapped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, it's encouraging to find at least one builder who is moving beyond the clichéd granite countertops and jetted spas, and is trying to woo customers with features that go a lot farther to make our homes more comfortable and livable. And as people live longer in their homes, I expect there will soon be more.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the inauguration of the nation's first African-American president still fresh in our memories, it is easy to forget that not that long ago hard-wired racism underpinned communities all over America -- not just in the states of the old Confederacy -- and that acquiring a home was, for black families, a process often fraught with humiliation and danger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In "Levittown," a vigorous and often surprising narrative, David Kushner journeys into the racially charged heart of what newspapers once trumpeted as "the most perfectly planned community in America." Today Levittown serves as condescending shorthand for suburban conformity. But just after World War II, Levittown, N.Y., and its sister community of Levittown, Pa., symbolized liberation from crowded urban neighborhoods for families whose idea of the American dream was a private home and a patch of grass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Levitt brothers -- Bill and Albert -- were both visionaries and brilliant businessmen, a winning combination. "In contemporary terms," Mr. Kushner writes, "they had the kinetic chemistry and renegade brash of a Silicon Valley start-up." They also had a winning idea: By adapting the techniques of mass production to homebuilding, the Levitts brought cheap, well-made homes within reach of returning GIs and the aspiring postwar middle class. They mass-produced concrete septic tanks, made pre-formed plumbing trees and chimneys, and framed entire walls on the ground, then raised each house quickly in place. They installed then-novel amenities such as brand-name appliances, closets with automatic lights and built-in television sets and added carefully landscaped lawns and even a birdhouse painted to match each home's shutters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both Levittowns were conceived from the start as complete communities, themselves prefabricated, so to speak, with shopping centers, churches, pools, parks, curved streets for a rural feel and cul-de-sacs where children could play safely. The Levittown customer, declared Bill Levitt, was "not just buying a house, he's buying a way of life." By 1952, the Levitts were building one out of every eight homes in the country. Time magazine dubbed their company the "General Motors of the housing industry."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there was a snake in paradise: racial segregation. Buyers of Levittown homes were required to sign a statement that declared, in bold capital letters, that they would "not permit the premises to be used or occupied by any person other than members of the Caucasian race." Like many developers, the Levitts believed that racial integration was commercial suicide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kushner suggests that the demand for housing in the years after the war was so great that the Levitts could have integrated their towns from the start and thus set a national pattern. Instead they capitulated to what they perceived to be Americans' darkest fears. "The plain fact is that most whites prefer not to live in mixed communities," Bill Levitt repeatedly declared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The core of Mr. Kushner's story focuses on the campaign to desegregate Levittown, Pa., in 1957. He deftly splices together the experiences of two families at the center of what became a terrifying ordeal. Bill and Daisy Myers and their children were educated, friendly, quiet people -- just the sort of folks anyone would want to have next-door -- except that they were black. Their staunchest local allies were Bea and Lew Wechsler, labor organizers and longtime members of the Communist Party. The Wechslers were among the few whites who remained uncowed by the venomous racism that gripped Levittown that summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the support of local Quakers and the NAACP, the Myerses moved into their Cape Cod-style "dream house" on Deepgreen Lane. They got more than they bargained for. Crosses were burned. Mobs waving Confederate flags staked out their home night and day. Rocks were thrown through their windows. Malicious callers rang their phone around the clock: "I will not let my children drink chocolate milk again as long as I live!" one irate woman yelled at Daisy Myers. Threats were made to burn them out. The local authorities refused to intervene. The police, for the most part, claimed that they were helpless to control the mobs. Many residents in fact blamed the Myerses for provoking all the "agitation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similar desegregation battles were taking places in many other communities at the same time (including the one in which I grew up, in Yonkers, N.Y.). But Levittown was a national symbol of the good life for all Americans. "The very people of Levittown considered the standoff as nothing less than the fight for the soul of new suburbia," Mr. Kushner writes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Myerses' battle to stay in Levittown made national news. When the press began to condemn Levittown as "a disgrace to America," Americans everywhere began to question what kind of postwar communities they had themselves created. In the end, with the state attorney general behind them, the Myerses won their battle to stay. Several of their tormenters were convicted of harassment, and the demonstrations petered out. The mass flight that racist whites feared never took place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Myerses suffered no further abuse, but they never felt at ease in Levittown after the summer of 1957. Five years later they moved to Harrisburg, Pa. Their story is a reminder that facing down segregation required from ordinary black men and woman a degree of heroism that few white Americans have ever been asked to exhibit except in war.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other black families followed the Myerses to Levittown, Pa. -- but not many. Its lingering reputation tended to keep African-Americans away. According to a recent census, only 2.45% of the town's residents were black.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bordewich's most recent book is "Washington: The Making of the American Capital."</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Lower U.S. mortgage rates help to bolster home sales</span>
</div><div class="author">By Conor Dougherty </div><div>438 words</div><div>4 February 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>10</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Distressed-home sales and falling mortgage rates helped stimulate the U.S. housing market in December. But recovery remains a way off as rising unemployment, a surplus of housing inventory and more home vacancies continue to weigh on home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors Tuesday said its index of pending home sales, which measures contracts signed but not closed, rose 6.3% in December from a month earlier. The index is designed to measure the direction of the housing market and should therefore translate into rising home sales in the beginning of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say the rise is partly the result of lower mortgage rates that pushed potential buyers into the market. The average rate for a conforming 30-year fixed mortgage fell to as low as 5.06% in December, a full percentage point from late November, according to HSH Associates, a financial publisher. Rates were 5.38% Monday evening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling mortgage rates have effectively cut the price of already less-expensive homes, making monthly payments more affordable and nudging prospective home buyers into the market. "The lower mortgage rates offset the need for big price declines," said Dan Oppenheim, a housing analyst at <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is good news for anyone trying to sell a home but probably doesn't foretell a housing turnaround. At the same time that home prices and mortgage rates have been falling, companies have slashed jobs, adding those who might have been home buyers to the ranks of the unemployed. The U.S.lost about two million jobs in the final four months of 2008; economists estimate the nation lost 538,000 nonfarm jobs in January and that the unemployment rate will have risen to 7.5% from 7.2% in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There also is a glut of unsold homes, and during the past few months roughly half of real-estate sales have been made up of distressed or foreclosed homes that are sold at bargain rates, and quickly. Rising home inventories and competition from distressed sales have created a brutal market for home sellers. Economists say the housing market will remain tough until inventories fall and foreclosure sales are a smaller slice of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report Tuesday, from the U.S. Census Bureau, showed the homeowner-vacancy rate increased to 2.9%, from 2.8% in the third quarter. The vacancy rate hovered between 2.8% and 2.9% throughout 2008, compared with between 2% and 2.8% from 2005 to 2007.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Annelena Lobb and Geoffrey Rogow  </div><div>507 words</div><div>4 February 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>20</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rise for health-care stocks and an unexpected increase in pending home sales helped major indexes break a three-session losing streak, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average up more than 100 points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market benchmark was up 141.53 points, or 1.8%, to 8078.36, led by Merck. The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span> 500-stock index rose 1.6% to 838.49. The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 1.5% to 1516.30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weakness for financial stocks and car makers served as a reminder of the shaky state of some of the pillars of the U.S. economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday's move appeared to be the continuation of a technical bounce that began when the S&amp;P 500 and Dow industrials tested their lows for the year on Monday, said Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist for options brokerage thinkorswim. Financial stocks were conspicuously absent from the rally, however, as <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> was 12% lower in late afternoon, and <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> was off 5.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What's discouraging in today's market is that the financials are taking it on the chin," Mr. Kinahan said. "There is no way we have any kind of long-term recovery without the financials being at least a stabilizer, if not a leader."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nobody is willing to buy financial stocks before the Treasury Department releases its plan on stabilizing the sector next week, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Are we nationalized, or are we not nationalized? Is it 'good bank/bad bank' and who falls under what category? There's so much uncertainty right now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the latest round of earnings reports, drug maker Merck was one of the few bright spots, up 7.5%, after posting a profit for the fourth quarter. Large health-care firms have been one of the stalwarts in equities to start 2009, with traders highlighting their defensive nature and strong balance sheets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the ascendancy of defensive stocks, which are thought to be a haven in the worst of times, points to a trading environment where economic concerns remain foremost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">General Motors</span> shed 2.4% after saying its light-vehicle sales plunged 59% in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And though the S&amp;P 500 index was up, its financial sector declined. <span class="companylink">PNC Financial Services</span> declined 7.2% after the bank posted a loss and said it plans to cut jobs as it integrates National City, which it acquired in December. Other regional lenders also declined, with <span class="companylink">SunTrust Banks</span> falling 17%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the National Association of Realtors reported a 6.3% rise in its gauge of pending home sales in December. Lower prices are drawing in buyers, the trade group said. Traders say a turnaround in the housing market will likely precede any economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crude-oil prices rose 70 cents to settle at $40.78 on the <span class="companylink">New York Mercantile Exchange</span>.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jonathan Karp </div><div>1045 words</div><div>4 February 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Commercial Real Estate; C1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank that funded a big part of the condominium boom is considering selling all or part of itself as rising defaults force it to seek capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Corus Bankshares Inc</span>., a symbol of the exuberance for glass-and-steel condo towers from Miami to Los Angeles, reported a $260.7 million quarterly loss late Friday and said that more than one-third of its $4.1 billion in outstanding loans were nonperforming. Amid what it called a "precipitous decline" in property values, the Chicago lender also warned that banking regulators may soon strip Corus of its standing as a well-capitalized bank and impose higher cash requirements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Dulberg, Corus's chief financial officer, said in an interview Tuesday that management is exploring options, including selling the bank or finding a strategic investor. "We are working with investment bankers and searching for capital, but it's a very tough market," he said. Mr. Dulberg said Corus still has $758 million in capital and nearly $4 billion in liquid assets that can be tapped to "meet the demands of borrowers and depositors." The vast majority of its $7.6 billion in consumer deposits is federally insured.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corus is one of the few lenders to report that the Treasury Department intends to reject the bank's application for funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts don't believe the bank can raise the capital necessary to survive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The company is in dire straits," said Daniel Cardenas, senior vice president at Chicago brokerage Howe Barnes Hoefer &amp;Arnett Inc. "Barring a surprise injection of private capital and/or a dramatic rebound in condo values, Corus appears unlikely to survive 2009."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cardenas on Monday reduced his 12-month target price for the stock to zero. In the two trading days since it reported its quarterly results, Corus has shed 63% of its value. Tuesday, Corus's shares fell 30%, or 18 cents, to 41 cents, in 4 p.m. composite trading on the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq Stock Market</span>. Corus's market capitalization has withered to some $22 million, limiting its financing options.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condos are one of the hardest-hit segments of the housing market. Many of them were bought by speculators who walked away from deposits when the market soured and never closed on their units, leaving developers with empty condos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, much of the new condo development is located in second-home markets, such as Florida, where prices have crashed and foreclosures have risen. There was a glut of 588,210 condo and cooperative apartments on the market in December, close to a 15-month supply, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it has been clear for months that thousands of condo projects were doomed, the full impact on financial institutions is only now being felt. Construction loans were structured with "interest reserves," provisions that gave developers funds to pay interest until the projects were complete. Now that projects are completed and failing to sell, the loans are going into default.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks and thrifts had $36 billion of condominium debt on their books as of the end of the fourth quarter, according to Foresight Analytics. Over the past year, the delinquency rate rose to 26% from 10%, estimates the Oakland, Calif., research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conditions are likely to get worse before they get better because many cities still are getting hit by a deluge of new supply. In Chicago, 5,570 units are scheduled to be delivered this year, up from 4,018 in 2008, according to <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>., a real-estate market-data firm. Deliveries are expected to increase in 16 other markets as well, including New York City, Phoenix, San Diego and Seattle, Reis said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With $8.4 billion in assets as of Dec. 31, Corus ranks as one of the biggest banks to flirt with failure this recession. The bank has been in regulators' cross hairs for months because its once-diversified lending unit, Corus Bank, bet almost exclusively on condos during the housing boom. More than four-fifths of Corus's loans are concentrated in construction and development projects, mostly condo buildings in speculative markets such as South Florida and Nevada and overbuilt cities such as Atlanta and Phoenix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strategy reaped often-huge profits, but in the second quarter of 2008 Corus reported the first loss in its 50-year history. As condos failed to sell and developers defaulted, Corus last year suspended new condo loans and later halted all commercial lending, among other steps, to preserve cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President and Chief Executive Robert Glickman, scion of the Minneapolis family that founded the bank, had maintained that Corus could weather the storm. In the latest financial results, the company conceded that the "housing calamity is worse than even the 'severe downturn' for which we had planned."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treasury officials have said that a bank's viability is a prime consideration in determining whether to grant TARP funds, but the denial of a request can depend on other factors. One red flag for regulators is a concentration in commercial real-estate loans, such as Corus has. Yet the move to establish a bank for toxic debt and other measures in the pending stimulus bill could offer relief for Corus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corus offers the starkest case study of the condo frenzy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Sunrise, Fla., west of Fort Lauderdale, Corus lent $126 million for two 26-story buildings with 396 luxury condos. The Tao Sawgrass complex stands empty, and Corus has repossessed the property. Corus also took over -- and then sought bankruptcy protection for -- a 765-condo complex in Panama City, Fla., where only 65 units had been sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dulberg, the Corus CFO, said the company's strategy for troubled projects is to reduce condo prices and provide consumer mortgages in order to stimulate sales. "Our focus is to move those units," he said, adding that the traditional spring buying season will measure the plan's success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corus has about $2 billion in unfunded construction commitments and that in the event of a federal takeover, regulators wouldn't be obligated to fund these commitments.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Deal of the Week; Buyer and Seller Opt for Path Least Taken in Deal of 3 Properties</span>
</div><div class="author">By Maura Webber Sadovi </div><div>854 words</div><div>4 February 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Commercial Real Estate; C10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the commercial real-estate landscape, the few transactions getting done involve sellers and buyers who view the world differently from the masses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take the case of the sale of three office buildings in New Jersey, Florida and California for a total of about $209 million. Both the buyer, a fund run by CB Richard Ellis Investors, and the seller, ING Clarion Partners LLC, a unit of <span class="companylink">ING Groep NV</span>, are going their own way in this market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike most fund managers, which are reluctant to sell in this market and lock in losses, ING Clarion decided to take a big hit in the deal. Its Clarion Lion Properties Fund purchased the properties in 2005 and 2006 for a total of $365 million, according to <span class="companylink">CoStar Group Inc</span>., a Bethesda, Md., commercial real-estate research firm. The all-cash price ING Clarion received constituted a 43% decline, CoStar said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ING Clarion executives declined to comment on the deal, which closed Dec. 30. But the firm has been selling properties to improve liquidity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>, meanwhile, took a different approach than many prospective buyers in valuing the properties. Buyers typically arrive at a value by dividing a property's cash flow by the price paid to get the capitalization, or "cap," rate. But during these tough times many prospective buyers aren't giving any cash-flow credit to vacant space, which is usually done in normal markets. In crunching the numbers they assume that vacant space isn't going to get filled, which leads to low valuations that many sellers won't accept.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In evaluating the ING Clarion properties, though, <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span> is projecting unleased space -- which ranges between about 24% and 28% -- eventually will get filled, said Mike Burrichter, a principal of the fund making the investment, Strategic Partners U.S. Value 5. "We're willing to price it the way we normally do ... and we are taking into account that eventually you will lease your vacancy," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Strategic Partners U.S. Value 5 is part of a $2 billion CBRE fund, which closed in May, and is targeting buildings in major metropolitan areas with moderate levels of vacancy that have turnaround potential. The fund's plan is to leverage its properties between 55% and 65%. It paid cash for the three buildings because of time pressure, but Mr. Burrichter said he is optimistic financing can be arranged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the lease-up strategy, the fund hopes to attract tenants by investing in such amenities as conference centers, gyms and new delis. It also plans to spend an unspecified amount on making the buildings more environmentally friendly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leasing space, though, clearly won't be easy. The 422,470-square-foot Metropolitan Center in East Rutherford, N.J., which sits across from the Meadowlands Sports Complex, has yet to fill a large block of space vacated by a shipping company in about 2003. The building now has to contend with the contraction of the New York City regional economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also is located in the Bergen County submarket, where asking rents in the $25-a-square-foot range last year were among the lowest for New York City-area submarkets, according to Property &amp;Portfolio Research Inc., a Boston real-estate research firm. Office vacancies in the Bergen County market are expected to rise to about 22% in the submarket in the second half of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other properties are the Lexington Building at 500 North Brand in Glendale, Calif., part of Los Angeles' Tri-Cities submarket, and the Esperante at 222 Lakeview Ave. in West Palm Beach, Fla. The vacancy rates in those property submarkets late last year were about 11% and 23%, respectively, according to PPR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Burrichter said CBRE isn't expecting to do a fast lease-up of the properties. "We expect 2009 to be very rough ... and we don't anticipate lighting the world on fire [in 2010] either," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Burrichter also said he isn't concerned that CBRE used a valuation strategy that was more optimistic than those used by other buyers. "There's a lot of chatter out there as to how real estate is being priced today. It's kind of a herd-like mentality and, frankly, I think the chatter amongst the brokers is designed to drive prices lower so they can increase volume."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A number of buyers scouted the three properties, said Jose Cruz, executive director with Cushman &amp;Wakefield's capital markets group, which represented ING Clarion on the East Rutherford property. He said the three buildings were sold in an auction-style bidding process that attracted investors from the U.S., Europe and the Middle East.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cruz said ING chose to go with <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>'s offer partly because it was for all the properties and was an all-cash deal that could close before the end of the year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of the stimulus bill, Congress is grappling with ways to fix a looming crisis in the nation's affordable-housing program caused by the economic downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government for many years has tried to stimulate the building of affordable housing through the tax code, by letting large companies shelter some profits in exchange for financing the development of low-income properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the biggest players no longer have profits to shelter, slowing the construction of affordable housing across the U.S. just as need for such housing is growing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The version of the stimulus bill already passed by the House of Representatives includes one provision aimed at bolstering the financing of low-income housing, by giving cash to state agencies that administer the tax credits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current bill making its way through the Senate contains a different approach, which would temporarily permit companies to use the affordable-housing credits to offset profits earned in the past five years, instead of in a single year as under current law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move would apply to other tax-credit programs beyond low-income housing, but could entice more companies to participate in the housing program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Started about two decades ago, the tax-credit program has become the main form of federal assistance to low-income housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The credits are awarded to housing developers, who then sell them to companies looking to cut their tax bills. Companies that buy the credits receive the benefit over 10 years. For that period, they are required to monitor the condition and continued affordability of the development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 2007, the market for the credits was dominated by financial institutions, with the two biggest buyers being mortgage giants <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. Other buyers have included <span class="companylink">Citigroup Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;Co</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the strains on Wall Street mean that many of these companies have exited the market, which has left many developers of low-income housing with credits they can't sell and some projects on hold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Theoretically, the tax credits should be more attractive than ever: The exit of major players means the yield to buyers has gone up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whereas two years ago a buyer could put up 95 cents and get one dollar of tax credit, now a dollar of tax credit can be had for as little as 75 cents in some markets, estimate several people who work on such deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors bought between $4 billion and $5 billion of these tax credits during 2008, down from between $7 billion and $8 billion in 2007, estimates Michael Novogradac, the managing partner of <span class="companylink">Novogradac &amp;Co</span>., an accounting and consulting firm that specializes in such deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among those lobbying in favor of the Senate proposal are so-called syndicators, companies that earn fees by putting together deals to sell the credits to investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The syndicators also are lobbying for an amendment sponsored by Sen. Maria Cantwell (D., Wash.) that would allow buyers temporarily to use the majority of the tax credits within three years, rather than spread equally over a decade.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Distressed-home sales and falling mortgage rates helped stimulate the housing market in December. But recovery remains a ways off as unemployment, a surplus of housing inventory and rising home vacancies continue to weigh on home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said Tuesday its index of pending home sales, which measures contracts signed but not closed, rose 6.3% to 87.7 in December from a month earlier. The index, designed to measure the direction of the housing market, was 87.1 for 2008 as a whole. It has fallen two years in a row; the pending-home-sales index was 111.9 in 2006, the year home sales began to slow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR, a trade association for real-estate agents, said the rise was indicative of a "modest rebound" in home sales. But the real-estate trade group continued to push for a mortgage-stimulus plan in hopes that that would bring more buyers into the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say the rise is partly the result of lower mortgage rates that pushed potential buyers into the market. The average rate for a conforming 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to as low as 5.06% in December, a full percentage point from late November, according to HSH Associates, a financial publisher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling mortgage rates have made monthly payments more affordable and nudged prospective buyers into the market. "The lower mortgage rates offset the need for big price declines," said Dan Oppenheim, a housing analyst at <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is good news for anyone trying to sell a home but probably doesn't foretell a housing turnaround. As home prices and mortgage rates have been falling, companies have slashed jobs, adding would-be home buyers to the ranks of the unemployed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there are indications that some earlier-hit markets could be bottoming out. Year-over-year, the pending-home-sales index was up 17.5% in western states and 1.6% in the South. The index was down year-over-year in both the Midwest and Northeast, indicating that those markets may have further to fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report from the Census Bureau showed the homeowner-vacancy rate increased to 2.9%, from 2.8% in the third quarter. The vacancy rate, which measures homes that are vacant or for sale, hovered between 2.8% and 2.9% throughout 2008; the rate's 50-year average is 1.5%.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. stocks rose Tuesday as earnings from Merck and a rare positive report about the housing market helped snap a three-session losing streak for the broad indexes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weakness in <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> and General Motors served as a reminder of how some pillars of the U.S. economy are barely holding up, however. The Obama administration is trying to signal to markets its readiness to address the crisis in the banking system and the labor market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Midsession, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said he had learned from policy mistakes in Japan that may have prolonged a recession there in 1990s, promising the U.S. would be very "aggressive." His remarks came in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market got an afternoon lift from the comments attributed to Geithner," said Michael Sheldon, market strategist at RDM Financial. "Drug stocks helped today from an earnings perspective and the economic news in terms of pending home sales provided a lift on the open."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 141.53 points, or 1.78%, to 8078.36, recouping some losses after three consecutive declines. The broad <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span> 500 added 13.07, or 1.58%, to 838.51. The technology-oriented Nasdaq Composite rose 21.87, or 1.46%, to 1516.30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dow component General Motors fell 4 cents, or 1.4%, to $2.85. GM said its light-vehicle sales plunged 59% in January. <span class="companylink">Ford Motor</span> rose 8 cents, or 4.3%, to 1.96 even after saying its January sales fell 40%, below already low expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American depositary shares of <span class="companylink">Toyota Motor</span> rose 1.71, or 2.7%, to 65.59. Toyota, now the largest auto maker in the world by sales volume, logged a 32% drop in January sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pressure remained on financial stocks: <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> fell 70 cents, or 12%, to 5.30, and came within 15 cents of its bear-market low during the session. <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> declined 19 cents, or 5.2%, to 3.46.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among other banks, <span class="companylink">PNC Financial Services</span> fell 2.33, or 7.2%, to 29.85. The bank posted a $248 million fourth-quarter loss and warned it will lay off 5,800 people as it integrates National City. Other regional lenders also declined: <span class="companylink">SunTrust Banks</span>, based in Atlanta, fell 1.93, or 16%, to 10.02. <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> cut its price target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Merck was the biggest gainer on the Dow, adding 1.81, or 6.4%, to 30.24, as the drug maker's fourth-quarter profit surpassed Wall Street's estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rival <span class="companylink">Schering-Plough</span> added 1.44, or 8.2%, to 18.91 after its swung to a fourth-quarter profit, helped by a 17% increase in sales. Allergy and brain-tumor drugs sold well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Dow Chemical</span> rose 30 cents, or 2.7%, to 11.35. Dow posted a quarterly loss and warned it could default on debt payments if it is forced to close the acquisition of rival <span class="companylink">Rohm &amp;Haas</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">United Parcel Service</span> added 2.58, or 6.1%, to 45. Freight volumes declined in the fourth quarter and the company warned volumes may be down for 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending home sales rose 6.3% in December because of falling mortgage rates and foreclosures. That buoyed the price of home-building stocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Walt Disney</span> added 42 cents, or 2.1%, to 20.62, but shares lost ground after the bell. The entertainment conglomerate said fiscal first-quarter profit fell 32% as advertising sales, theme-park profit and DVD sales all dropped.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the commercial real-estate landscape, the few transactions getting done involve sellers and buyers who view the world differently from the masses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take the case of the sale of three office buildings in New Jersey, Florida and California for a total of about $209 million. Both the buyer, a fund run by CB Richard Ellis Investors, and the seller, ING Clarion Partners LLC, a unit of <span class="companylink">ING Groep NV</span>, are going their own way in this market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike most fund managers, which are reluctant to sell in this market and lock in losses, ING Clarion decided to take a big hit in the deal. Its Clarion Lion Properties Fund purchased the properties in 2005 and 2006 for a total of $365 million, according to <span class="companylink">CoStar Group Inc</span>., a Bethesda, Md., commercial real-estate research firm. The all-cash price ING Clarion received constituted a 43% decline, CoStar said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ING Clarion executives declined to comment on the deal, which closed Dec. 30. But the firm has been selling properties to improve liquidity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>, meanwhile, took a different approach than many prospective buyers in valuing the properties. Buyers typically arrive at a value by dividing a property's cash flow by the price paid to get the capitalization, or "cap," rate. But during these tough times many prospective buyers aren't giving any cash-flow credit to vacant space, which is usually done in normal markets. In crunching the numbers they assume that vacant space isn't going to get filled, which leads to low valuations that many sellers won't accept.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In evaluating the ING Clarion properties, though, <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span> is projecting unleased space -- which ranges between about 24% and 28% -- eventually will get filled, said Mike Burrichter, a principal of the fund making the investment, Strategic Partners U.S. Value 5. "We're willing to price it the way we normally do . . . and we are taking into account that eventually you will lease your vacancy," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Strategic Partners U.S. Value 5 is part of a $2 billion CBRE fund, which closed in May, and is targeting buildings in major metropolitan areas with moderate levels of vacancy that have turnaround potential. The fund's plan is to leverage its properties between 55% and 65%. It paid cash for the three buildings because of time pressure, but Mr. Burrichter said he is optimistic financing can be arranged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the lease-up strategy, the fund hopes to attract tenants by investing in such amenities as conference centers, gyms and new delis. It also plans to spend an unspecified amount on making the buildings more environmentally friendly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leasing space, though, clearly won't be easy. The 422,470-square-foot Metropolitan Center in East Rutherford, N.J., which sits across from the Meadowlands Sports Complex, has yet to fill a large block of space vacated by a shipping company in about 2003. The building now has to contend with the contraction of the New York City regional economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also is located in the Bergen County submarket, where asking rents in the $25-a-square-foot range last year were among the lowest for New York City-area submarkets, according to Property &amp;Portfolio Research Inc., a Boston real-estate research firm. Office vacancies in the Bergen County market are expected to rise to about 22% in the submarket in the second half of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other properties are the Lexington Building at 500 North Brand in Glendale, Calif., part of Los Angeles' Tri-Cities submarket, and the Esperante at 222 Lakeview Ave. in West Palm Beach, Fla. The vacancy rates in those property submarkets late last year were about 11% and 23%, respectively, according to PPR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Burrichter said CBRE isn't expecting to do a fast lease-up of the properties. "We expect 2009 to be very rough . . . and we don't anticipate lighting the world on fire [in 2010] either," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Burrichter also said he isn't concerned that CBRE used a valuation strategy that was more optimistic than those used by other buyers. "There's a lot of chatter out there as to how real estate is being priced today. It's kind of a herd-like mentality and, frankly, I think the chatter amongst the brokers is designed to drive prices lower so they can increase volume."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A number of buyers scouted the three properties, said Jose Cruz, executive director with Cushman &amp;Wakefield's capital markets group, which represented ING Clarion on the East Rutherford property. He said the three buildings were sold in an auction-style bidding process that attracted investors from the U.S., Europe and the Middle East.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cruz said ING chose to go with <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>'s offer partly because it was for all the properties and was an all-cash deal that could close before the end of the year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- A yardstick for the U.S. housing market showed a surprise gain in December, but economists aren't ready to call a bottom for the sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors' index for pending sales of previously owned homes increased 6.3% to 87.7 from 82.5 in November, the industry group said Tuesday. Private analysts had projected that pending sales would fall 0.5% during December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a further sign that property is moving in distressed markets as buyers snap up foreclosed real estate. Last week, the realtors' association reported that home resales in December climbed by 6.5% to a 4.74 million annual rate. Of that total, 45% were distress sales at discounted prices. The median home price fell 15.3% to $175,400 from $207,000 in December 2007 -- the largest drop on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories remain high. The glut of unsold homes is forcing prices lower, and falling prices are discouraging purchases. Builders aren't breaking ground because demand is too weak and supply too elevated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the Commerce Department said the U.S. home-vacancy rate rose one tenth of a percentage point to 2.9% in the fourth quarter of last year. The figure matches a record set in the first quarter of 2008. Meanwhile, the U.S. homeownership rate dropped to 67.5% from 67.9% in the third quarter. Homeownership peaked at 69.2% in 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the upticks in recent sales gauges, the housing market still needs stimulus, the realtors' association said. "We need to take additional steps to meaningfully draw down inventory and stabilize home prices," association President Charles McMillan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ian Lyngen, an analyst at RBS Greenwich Capital, said the surprise uptick came "short of signaling a bottom for housing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I look for housing inventories-to-sales ratios to get back to seven to eight months of supply, which would be consistent with a housing market in equilibrium," said Michael Darda, chief economist at MKM Partners. "Home prices thus may not bottom until 2010-2011."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors' pending-home-sales index, based on signed contracts for previously owned homes, aims to measure which way the housing market is going in the future. A home sale is pending when the contract has been signed but the transaction hasn't closed; pending sales typically close within one or two months of signing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gauge had gone down 3.7% during November; that's a revision from a previously estimated 4.0% decline. The index in December was 2.1% above the level of 85.9 in December 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The realtors' association report sees demand increasing mildly this year. In its monthly forecast on the industry, the association projected existing-home sales at 5.12 million in 2009 and 5.44 million in 2010. That compares with 4.91 million in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for an existing home is seen at $192,800 in 2009, compared with $198,600 in 2008. However, the group expects the median price to rise in 2010, to $201,700.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A month ago, the realtors' association forecast 2009 sales at 5.22 million and 2010 sales at 5.58 million. The 2009 median price was projected at $198,100 and the 2010 price at $207,700.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kelly Evans </div><div>582 words</div><div>3 February 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>11</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. manufacturing activity got a bit of a reprieve in January, but steep declines in consumer spending suggest talk of a recovery in that sector is premature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management said Monday that manufacturing activity contracted in January but at a slower rate than in December, based on a survey of suppliers across 18 different manufacturing industries. Activity rose to a level of 35.6 from December's 32.9, which was the weakest since ISM records began in 1948, as new orders and production showed particular improvement. But activity in the sector overall remained below 50 -- the level that indicates growth -- for the 12th month in a row.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm hesitant to be encouraged, but at least the rate of decline has slowed," survey chairman Norbert Ore said. He said the sector's dependence on the housing and auto industries suggests that until those industries show some improvement, troubles are likely to persist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sharp decline in consumer spending is a key reason why the housing, auto and manufacturing industries continue to struggle. A Commerce Department report also released Monday showed consumer spending fell 1% in December, the fifth-straight monthly decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop reflected lower prices on consumer goods and services as well as softer demand. Prices fell 0.5% from the previous month after a 1.1% drop in November, while the "core" index that excludes food and energy prices -- a gauge of inflation -- was unchanged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer spending is under pressure as personal income continues to slump and battered Americans are shifting into savings mode. Personal income sank 0.2% in December from the previous month, the third consecutive decline. Meanwhile, the saving rate rose to 3.6% of after-tax income following 2.8% in November; economists say it could hit double-digits by year end, a sharp reversal from the low and even negative rates seen earlier this decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weak customer demand is likely to keep manufacturing activity subdued for the next several months, though industry watchers are hoping low mortgage rates will stimulate home buying and new-home construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending on construction activity fell 1.4% in December from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.05 trillion, Commerce said in a separate report Monday, as spending on both residential and nonresidential projects like lodging, office, and transportation declined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all of 2008, residential spending slumped by about 27%, and total construction spending dropped 5.1% to $1.08 trillion, the biggest annual drop since records began in 1993. This year could see a similar decline, economists say, as spending on nonresidential construction is beginning to drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturing activity in particular is a useful leading gauge of the U.S. economy, which has been in recession since December 2007. A sustained pickup in orders for manufactured goods is often a sign that industries are seeing and anticipating a higher level of consumer demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New orders, one of the 10 components of the ISM index, jumped to a level of 33.2 last month from 23.1 in December. Production rose five points to a similar level, and export activity also increased. On the flip side, the employment index was unchanged at a low level of 29.9. Finally, prices rose, also from a low level, which helped boost the overall index.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. consumers cut their spending during December and increased savings in fear of a jobless rate that keeps rising in the deepening recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, U.S. manufacturing contracted at a slower pace in January. A report from the Institute for Supply Management Monday said the private research group's January index for factory activity stood at a better-than-expected 35.6, from December's 32.9. Economists had expected the index to come in at 32. Readings under 50 indicate contracting activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the report's other findings, employment suffered again, with that index at 29.9, the same reading as the month before. The production index for January was 32.1, versus 26.3 the month before, while the new-orders index was 33.2, from 23.1. The ISM also said its inventories index hit 37.5, after standing at 39.6 in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personal consumption fell 1% from the month before. Spending had decreased 0.8% in November; originally, spending was seen down 0.6%. October spending dropped 1.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personal income fell at a seasonally adjusted rate of 0.2% compared with the month before, the Commerce Department said Monday. Income decreased a revised 0.4% in November; originally, income for that month was seen 0.2% lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast a 0.4% decrease in personal income during December and a 0.8% drop in consumer spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personal savings as a percentage of disposable personal income was 3.6% in December, the highest since 4.8% in May 2008. It was 2.8% in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The saving rate jumped in May and has since then been at levels higher than the rates in recent years. People are squirreling away money as fears rise over layoffs. Nonfarm payrolls fell by 524,000 jobs in December, and the jobless rate was 7.2%. The government will release on Friday its employment rate for January; analysts forecast the jobless rate rising to 7.5% and payrolls losing a further 525,000 jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recession deepened at the end of 2008. The U.S. government last week reported that gross domestic product shrank by 3.8% in the fourth quarter, the most in 26 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending on durable goods, those designed to last three years or longer, decreased 1.3% in December, after rising 0.4% the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, U.S. construction spending took its third tumble in a row during December as the housing slump wore on, the commercial sector fell, and government outlays dropped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total spending decreased 1.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.054 trillion compared with the prior month, the Commerce Department said. Spending fell 1.2% in November; originally, November spending was seen at a 0.6% decline. October outlays dropped 0.7%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors and analysts who said the top of the housing market would be immune to the rest of the market's travails have now mostly given up. Most agree high-end homes have followed the rest of the market into the tank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what if the high end actually does worse than the rest of the market? Consider:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jumbo Defaults. This past week, data showed that the delinquency rate for jumbo mortgages -- those too big to qualify for backing by the government -- at 6.9% of prime loans is more than three times as high as regular conforming loans. That suggests mortgages taken out by the affluent and wealthy, or at least the aspiring or former wealthy, are deteriorating at a faster rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fewer Buyers. When seemingly everyone was getting richer, there was a rising number of buyers. With Richistan evacuating faster than Malibu in a mudslide, the number of potential buyers for $1 million-plus homes is on the decline. At least on the middle and lower end of the housing market, there is a crowd of first-time buyers and discount-seekers ready to take up the slack.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worst Regions. The regions with the highest-valued properties -- New York, California, Nevada -- have reported the steepest price declines. That means homes once priced at the top of the national market may take the biggest spill -- and have the hardest time recovering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Indebted Rich. Many assumed the wealthy were living more within their means than the rest of the population. But they may have been just as leveraged as everyone else -- and certainly owe more in dollar terms. From 1995 to 2004, the top 1% of Americans by wealth more than doubled their mortgage and residential debt to $494 billion.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, says a "senior" Blackstone employee distributed login information for one account to other employees.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just two years after former Democratic presidential hopeful John Edwards sold his Washington home for $5.2 million, its current owners are trying to sell it, renovated, for almost twice as much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The former North Carolina senator, John Kerry's running mate in the 2004 race, sold the early 19th-century Georgetown four-story townhouse (left) in December 2006 as he was embarking on his race for the '08 Democratic presidential nomination. He and his wife, Elizabeth, bought the home in '02 for $3.8 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current sellers, asking $9.95 million, are Paul and Terry Klaassen, co-founders of <span class="companylink">Sunrise Assisted Living</span>, a McLean, Va., firm that houses and cares for the elderly. Among other renovations, the Klaassens reconfigured the layout to include an open kitchen, adding a billiard room and a gym; they installed a hot tub, fire pit and fountains in the garden and renovated the carriage house, according to the listing. The Klaassens couldn't be reached for comment. Heidi Hatfield and Anne Hatfield Weir, of Washington Fine Properties, have the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hollywood's Grazer Ends Listing of $27.5 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than a year after listing his Los Angeles house for $27.5 million, Hollywood producer Brian Grazer has taken it off the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1992, Mr. Grazer, who's produced a string of hits, and his then-wife, novelist and screenwriter Gigi Levangie Grazer, bought the circa-1940 house, on a cliff in the city's Pacific Palisades neighborhood. (Michael Smith, who's now decorating President Barack Obama's White House quarters, designed the interiors.) The Grazers added a two-bedroom guest house on the three-acre property, among other renovations. The main house measures 9,000 square feet. Stephen Shapiro, of Westside Estate Agency, had the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Credits of Mr. Grazer, who co-founded production company Imagine Entertainment with director Ron Howard, include "The Da Vinci Code" and TV shows such as "Friday Night Lights."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, actor Nicolas Cage has cut the price on a Los Angeles house where singers Dean Martin and Tom Jones once lived. It's now $19.75 million, down from $25 million and 44% less than his original listing price in October 2006. (The house has been sporadically off the market.) James Chalke, of Nelson Shelton &amp;Associates, has the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Athletes' Game: Battle Slump</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the guarded and gated Vaquero community of Westlake, Texas, four top athletes are coping with the luxury real-estate slump in different ways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Former New England Patriot quarterback Drew Bledsoe has lowered the price on his 5,500-square-foot house to $1.625 million, slightly less than the $1.7 million he paid for it new in 2005. He listed it a year ago. Vaquero, about 30 miles northwest of downtown Dallas, has a private golf club.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also in Vaquero, first baseman Mark Teixeira, just signed to the Yankees, took his $5.75 million one-acre property off the market after listing it last February. In August, former hockey player Steve Duchesne took his 7,200-square-foot Vaquero house off the market, while golfer Brian Watts is still asking $5.45 million for his 1.7-acre property, listed in February. Gianna Cerullo, of Dave Perry Miller &amp;Associates, had or still has the listings.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Firms in U.S. keep retrenching --- Drop in durable-goods orders and new jobless figures damp prospects for 2nd-half rebound</span>
</div><div class="author">By Kelly Evans </div><div>625 words</div><div>30 January 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>12</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. companies continue to slash work forces, close factories and stores, and are generally pulling back on investment, damping prospects for a rebound in economic growth in the year's second half.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for big-ticket manufactured goods such as machinery, metals and computer equipment slumped in December for the fifth month in a row, the Commerce Department said Thursday, a sign that businesses are holding off on investment in the face of weak demand and losses in the final months of 2008. Orders for such "durable goods" fell 2.6% in December to about $176 billion, following a 3.7% drop in November and an 8.5% slump in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It means this year is off to a very weak start," said David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities. "Businesses aren't going to invest and expand capacity in an economy where consumers are cutting back."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The troubles have already triggered widespread layoffs and rising unemployment. The U.S. jobless rate last month hit 7.2%, the highest since 1993, and in turn throngs of Americans are relying on unemployment benefits. The Labor Department said Thursday that as of mid-January, nearly 4.8 million Americans were receiving jobless benefits -- the most since it began keeping track in 1967. An additional 588,000 people, seasonally adjusted, filed new claims for benefits last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Given their shrinking revenues and the grim outlook for the economy, the only avenue companies have left to prevent going belly-up is to reduce their biggest cost, which is labor," said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at Economic Outlook Group in Princeton, N.J., in a client note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies' increasingly frugal ways also are worrisome because business investment is a key driver of U.S. economic growth, making up about 15% of gross domestic product.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A wide range of industries saw a drop in new orders last month, including aircraft, autos, computers and electronics, metals used in production and machinery. Orders for defense goods rose, a lone bright spot for much of 2008. But inventory levels were up nearly across the board, suggesting manufacturers are stuck with excess goods as customer demand erodes. Indeed, a separate gauge earlier this month showed some 30% of manufacturers' capacity is sitting idle, a sign more cost-cutting measures are likely on the way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investment held up reasonably well for most of last year, even as consumer spending slowed, thanks in part to strong foreign demand for goods. But the financial crisis and seizing up of credit and lending markets in mid-September represented a global event that intensified economic woes world-wide. A gauge of future business spending -- orders for nondefense, nonaircraft goods -- tanked at the end of the year, falling 2.8% in December from the previous month, in an ominous sign for spending in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop in business investment is a key reason why U.S. economic output, which contracted at an estimated 5% to 6% annual rate in the fourth quarter, is expected to shrink by a similar amount in the first three months of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, a sector whose outlook remains closely tied to the U.S. economy's prospects -- the housing market -- continues to struggle. Sales of newly built homes, a small but telling slice of the market, sank nearly 15% in December from the previous month, the Commerce Department said, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 331,000 units. The anemic sales pace in December was 45% lower than in December 2007.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- New-home sales in the U.S. plunged in December, capping the worst year for sales since 1982.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of single-family homes decreased 14.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 331,000, the Commerce Department said Thursday. November new-home sales fell 4.4% to an annual rate of 388,000; originally, the government said November sales dropped 2.9% to 407,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had estimated a 2.9% decrease in December sales to a 395,000 annual rate. The drop was the fifth in a row.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales were 44.8% lower than the level in December 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a not seasonally adjusted basis, the level of home sales in 2008 was 482,000, the lowest mark since 412,000 in 1982.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, U.S. durable-goods orders tumbled in December more than expected as the deepening recession restrained demand in the U.S. and abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturers' orders for long-lasting goods decreased 2.6% in December to a seasonally adjusted $176.8 billion, the Commerce Department said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2.6% decrease was bigger than projected. Wall Street had expected a decline of 2% in overall durables for December. The drop would have been larger if not for an increase in military plane orders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, weekly U.S. jobless claims rose as continuing claims hit a record 4,776,000. Meanwhile, new claims for state unemployment benefits held largely steady near quarter-century highs last week, suggesting another steep decline in employment this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial claims for jobless benefits rose 3,000 to 588,000 after seasonal adjustments in the week ended Jan. 24, the Labor Department said.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">How To Downsize Your House</span>
</div><div class="author">By June Fletcher </div><div>740 words</div><div>29 January 2009</div><div>10:07</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Real Estate</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many people are looking to downsize these days, either because they're getting older or they need to reduce the financial burdens of a big house and mortgage. But editing a lifetime's worth of possessions can be difficult.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I spoke recently with Jim Henderson, president of William C. Huff Companies [http://www.wchuffmoving.com], a moving and storage firm with offices in Naples, Fla., and Barrington, N.H., to find out how to handle what is often a time-consuming and emotional process. Mr. Henderson specializes in affluent homeowners, whose homes average 6,000 square feet, and who may pay up to $100,000 to move a household full of antiques, artwork and other fine furnishings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are his tips:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Start early: Too often, families don't start going through their things until they've signed a contract on their new home. Then as they become overwhelmed with other details of moving, they quickly abandon the process and frantically throw everything into boxes at the last minute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moving to a smaller home is much less stressful if you start to weed through your things at least three to six weeks before you put your old house on the market. It also will make the house look less cluttered and more desirable to buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few years back, Mr. Henderson moved from a house in New Hampshire where he'd lived for 19 years. But because he and his wife didn't get around to weeding out their things before hand and packed at the last minute, he now has a warehouse full of things he, his wife and his two kids, now 26 and 22, no longer use. "I'm a perfect example of what not to do," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Use concentric circles: When we acquire objects, we place them in our house relative to their emotional value to us. Objects that are in the heart of the home, in the family room and kitchen, are those we value and use the most, so they can be packed up immediately. Those objects farthest away from these rooms, in a shed, attic or basement, may have lost their importance to us over time. That's where we should begin the culling process. Then move to other rooms farthest from the home's prime living areas, like the bedrooms. Continue culling in ever-smaller circles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Involve your spouse and children: The job of editing a family's possessions usually falls on women, but it's essential that the whole family be involved, since objects hold different meaning for different people. A wife who decides to save her child's outgrown toy train set may later discover that her adult child doesn't want it and she's been storing it for years for no reason. Conversely, she may inadvertently toss an old baseball glove of her husband's that reminds him of the summer he was the Little League pitching star and holds great sentimental value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Use your imagination: Try to envision where every object will fit in your new house, and decide whether you'll still be using it two or three years from now. If you can't use it, toss, sell or donate the item.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider selling your home furnished: Although most people put great emotional value on artwork and personal possessions, furnishings like couches, rugs and end tables usually have less meaning. By offering your home furnished, you'll drastically reduce moving costs and may make your home more valuable to buyers, especially if your home is in a resort area. Then you can shop for new furnishings that better work with your new, downsized space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Digitize photographs: Photos of family and friends are often our most valued possessions. They're also often stuck in bulky boxes somewhere, where they can't be enjoyed and are vulnerable to fire, water damage or insect infestation. Allow yourself several days to go through your collection, throwing out duplicate and unflattering shots. Scan the remainder, and then make a CD, which you should keep in a fireproof safe or your safety deposit box. As a further backup, post the photos to a Web site. Then arrange the paper photos in beautiful albums that you can keep in your new home's family room, where you'll be more likely to look at them often.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve inched toward a new program to purchase long-term U.S. Treasury securities, possibly the next step in the central bank's battle against a recession that it said has only deepened in recent weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Industrial production, housing starts and employment have continued to decline steeply, as consumers and businesses have cut back spending," Fed officials said Wednesday in a policy statement following a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets the central bank's direction. "Furthermore, global demand appears to be slowing significantly."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed has already pulled its main lever for managing the economy as far as it can. Its benchmark short-term interest rate -- the federal-funds rate -- hovers near zero, and policy makers reiterated the rate would remain low "for some time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the funds rate about as low as it can go, officials are focused on developing new lending and asset-purchase programs to bring down an array of other interest rates and boost the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the list of next steps could be an effort to buy long-term government debt, which could in effect lower rates on mortgages and other debt. But the Fed is taking a slow path toward embracing the idea, something that has unsettled some investors. Disappointed that the central bank didn't take a more decisive step toward buying government bonds, investors sold Treasury bonds Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An effort to buy long-term government bonds could help the economy broadly because many kinds of debt -- from mortgages to corporate bonds -- are benchmarked to Treasury yields. Fed purchases could raise Treasury prices, which would reduce their yields and thus yields on other kinds of debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, it would be a controversial move at a time when government budget deficits are soaring. Some might see it as an inflationary move to finance deficits by printing money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With economic slack building so abruptly around the world, Fed officials don't see inflation as a worry now. In their statement, they pointed to a different worry: that inflation would fall below their comfort levels, believed to be roughly between 1% and 2%. An abrupt fall in inflation raises the inflation-adjusted cost of borrowing, which could be a new hindrance to growth and recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two other programs geared toward the credit market are still in the process of being ramped up. Officials have high hopes they will more directly ease strains afflicting consumers and businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one, the Fed is buying $600 billion of securities issued or guaranteed by government-linked mortgage-finance companies like <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. In the other, which won't be operational until February, it will provide up to $200 billion of financing to investors buying securities tied to consumer debt like car loans or credit cards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are lots of channels through which the Fed is working hard and using its balance sheet to ease financial conditions," said Richard Berner, chief U.S. economist with <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>. "Buying Treasurys is only one of those."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Operationally, buying Treasurys would be easy for the Fed after a year of complicated efforts to revive markets. It has clear legal authority to buy government debt and the markets desk of the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of New York</span> has a long history of trading bonds with securities dealers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The approach is favored by some members of the Fed's policy-making arm, the Federal Open Market Committee. Dissenting from the Fed's latest policy statement Wednesday, Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, said purchasing Treasury bonds was preferable to the Fed's many other new lending programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has highlighted the possibility of Treasury purchases twice in speeches since December. In its statement Wednesday, the central bank said it "is prepared" to take such a step, stronger language than it has used before. But the Fed said it depended on "evolving circumstances," and whether such a move would translate into help for private-sector debt markets. It offered no plan for moving forward on such purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market sold off sharply on the hesitant approach. The 10 and 30-year Treasury bonds fell on the day by 1 9/32 points and 4 11/32 points, respectively. Treasury yields are still very low. The yield on a 10-year note hit 2.66% Wednesday. Still, they have pushed higher in recent weeks, from just above 2% in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Uncertainty about the Fed is one factor pushing yields up recently. A range of other factors are at play, from the mountain of supply hitting the market as deficits rise, to concerns that foreign buyers may back away as the global economy contracts. Many estimates put the Treasury's borrowings this year at $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion. In recent years, $300 billion was considered a large amount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter Hooper, chief economist for <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>, said the Fed hasn't felt much pressure to begin the program because Treasury yields have been so low. But "if Treasury yields rise appreciably," he said, then the program "becomes a more important part of the picture."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economic backdrop is souring fast. Economists believe the nation's gross domestic product contracted at an annual rate of 5% or more in the fourth quarter.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jonathan Karp </div><div>971 words</div><div>28 January 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Real Estate; C8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Francisco's biggest apartment owner has tripped on its financial high-wire act and is racing to secure a safety net.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The closely held Lembi Group recently handed over 51 buildings to one lender because of nonperforming loans and is now trying to renegotiate some $1 billion in short-term debt to save dozens more buildings in its portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Lembi Group is viewed as a barometer of San Francisco's multifamily market, traditionally one of the country's strongest in terms of occupancy and rent growth. Yet while the group's woes offer evidence that local rents are softening, the situation more broadly underscores the pitfalls of using high-leverage financing for aggressive purchases of rent-regulated properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York's Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town, which were bought for $5.4 billion in 2006 by a venture led by Tishman Speyer Properties and BlackRock Realty Advisors, are among other developments facing a similar predicament as the Lembi Group. The landlords haven't been able to replace rent-regulated tenants with those who pay higher, market rates fast enough to cover their debt costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By spending more than $1 billion between 2003 and 2007 and borrowing up to 95% of a building's purchase price, the Lembi Group became San Francisco's dominant residential landlord. The group, whose main units are CitiApartments Inc., Skyline Realty Inc. and Trophy Properties, amassed a portfolio of 307 buildings and more than 8,000 apartments across the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent weeks, the group ceded ownership of 51 buildings, comprising some 1,400 apartments, to UBS AG through deeds in lieu of foreclosure. Walter Lembi, managing director of Lembi Group, said the shortfall between income and debt service on the buildings was $3 million a month. Lembi executives say they are negotiating with several other lenders to extend close to $1 billion in mortgages, some of which are securitized, that are due to mature over six to 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That figure doesn't include a $164 million loan secured by 24 apartment buildings. CIM Group of Los Angeles bought the senior debt for this portfolio at a discount. The interest reserves, or bank funds that provide cash flow to help service the loan, recently ran out, says Mr. Lembi. Mr. Lembi declined to comment on whether CIM has filed a notice of default. CIM also declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problems represent a reversal of fortune for Mr. Lembi, whose father started the business in 1946. After a four-year buying binge that pushed up San Francisco apartment prices, he put up 18 buildings for sale last year, arousing market suspicion that the group was overextended. At the time, Mr. Lembi acknowledged he was working to extend short-term loans but denied he was under pressure to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lembi blames his firm's problems on the combination of the credit crunch and recession, which conspired to make the group's normal exit strategies -- refinancing or selling -- virtually impossible. "Because of the disturbance in the marketplace, lenders got nervous and held back," he says. "Nobody could have predicted this train wreck."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Lembi's high-leverage strategy, which had worked for nearly a decade, left little margin for error. His plan was to buy buildings, induce tenant turnover through buyout offers and other means, renovate apartments and lease them out at market rates. Key to his model were the availability of interest reserves until market-rate tenants could be found and a building could be refinanced with a longer-term fixed-rate mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The finances were such that because he borrowed up 95% of a building's value, Mr. Lembi had to convert about three-quarters of a building's tenants to market rents during the two-year period of the interest reserves. But the wheels came off last year: As loans came due and couldn't be refinanced, the Lembi Group didn't have funds to complete renovations or pay tenants to move out. The relocation rate fell far below the 75% target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least one lender sold Lembi debt at distressed levels. <span class="companylink">UBS</span>, the Lembi Group's largest lender, opted to take possession of 51 buildings that were collateral for nonperforming loans and hold them until markets improve. It retained the Lembi Group to manage the buildings for a fee, citing the firm's "knowledge of the properties and issues related to the buildings," UBS spokesman Doug Morris says. He didn't give a timeframe for the arrangement, but added, "We will continually evaluate the best way to manage the properties and make adjustments as needed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the terms of the <span class="companylink">UBS</span> deal, Mr. Lembi says, he is released from a personal guarantee of about $400 million, but he is subject to other guarantees that he declined to specify or quantify. Mr. Lembi says he won't be able to strike a similar deal -- deed in lieu of foreclosure -- with other lenders because the <span class="companylink">UBS</span> transaction used up corporate losses that offset tax liabilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 51 apartment buildings that <span class="companylink">UBS</span> took over are about 98% occupied and, now that there are no debt-service payments, they are generating positive cash flow, according to people familiar with the finances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as San Francisco brokers and landlords report an uptick in apartment vacancies to between 4% and 5%, along with softening prices, Mr. Lembi says that occupancy in his remaining 250 buildings remains robust. Brokerage firm Marcus &amp;Millichap forecasts that San Francisco will be the most attractive apartment market again in 2009, though vacancies are expected to rise and rent growth will moderate.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Home prices, jobless rate depress U.S. consumers</span>
</div><div class="author">By Kelly Evans and Conor Dougherty </div><div>769 words</div><div>28 January 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>12</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fresh signs of U.S. economic weakness emerged Tuesday as home prices posted further declines, consumer confidence sank to a new low, and state unemployment rates increased across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in November declined in each of the 20 regions tracked by the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller index, falling 18.2% on average from a year earlier. The 20-city index has fallen for 28 consecutive months, going back to August 2006, with declines accelerating at the end of last year as the credit crisis hit the broader economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are down about 25% from their peak in mid-2006, but many economists say they still have further to fall. Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist at forecasting firm MFR Inc. in New York, noted that home prices rose some 155% from 1999 to their peak, and have so far reversed only a fraction of that amount. He estimates the index "is perhaps one-half to two-thirds of the way through its ultimate total decline in this cycle."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While that will create more headaches for banks and other institutions saddled with losses from mortgage-related products, there are signs that the price declines are helping to spur buying activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales in December posted a 6.5% gain from the previous month, as the National Association of Realtors said the median home sales price last month was down 15% from the previous year to $175,400. Nearly half of home sales last month were foreclosures or "distressed" properties, whose bargain prices, combined with historically low mortgage rates, seem to be a key driver of sales activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are big headwinds preventing a full-blown housing recovery, primarily the sharp rise in U.S. unemployment, currently 7.2%, a 16-year high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to a Labor Department survey, also released Tuesday, joblessness in December was worst in the West and Midwest, indicating that the industries hit first by the recession -- housing and manufacturing -- continue to lose jobs. But with almost every state in recession, joblessness is just a matter of degree: Northeastern states, which have a heavy concentration of finance jobs, saw a steep rise in unemployment, as did Southern economies, which for most of last year had been buffered by high oil prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The widespread rise in joblessness has led to steep state budget cuts and has exhausted state unemployment funds. Aid to states will likely be a part of any federal stimulus plan, and some state legislatures have essentially put off budget negotiations until it is clearer how much money they will get and in what form.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. lost about two million jobs in the last four months of 2008, cutting across sectors from manufacturing to retailing and professional and business services. Monday, companies from a broad swath of industries announced job cuts, including retailer <span class="companylink">Home Depot Inc</span>., heavy-equipment maker <span class="companylink">Caterpillar Inc</span>. and cellphone-service provider <span class="companylink">Sprint Nextel Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Likewise, job losses have been geographically broad. In December, 48 states saw decreases in nonfarm employment, according to the state employment report, released by the Labor Department Tuesday. The exceptions were Louisiana, which is still recovering from the effects of Hurricane Katrina, and the District of Columbia, which is buffered by federal spending. Employment was unchanged in Oklahoma.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worries about jobs and the economy in general have pushed consumer confidence to record lows, raising concerns that consumer spending -- the biggest driver of U.S. economic growth -- will follow suit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer confidence this month sank to a reading of 37.7, the lowest since the monthly series began in 1967, according to data released Tuesday from the Conference Board, a New York business-research group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers' assessment of current and future conditions deteriorated this month, in an ominous start to 2009. In a grim sign for big-ticket items such as houses and cars, only 10% of respondents said they expect their income to increase this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To some extent, the pattern of home-price declines matches the regions hit hardest by the current recession, which began in December 2007. Phoenix and Las Vegas, Sunbelt cities battered by the housing bust, posted the biggest yearly drops in November, falling by about 33% and 31.6%, respectively. San Francisco, Miami, Los Angeles and San Diego also declined by more than 25%. Detroit, the center of the ailing auto industry, saw prices fall nearly 21%. Meanwhile, prices in Dallas had the shallowest yearly decline, falling just 3.3%.</p>

</p><div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">News in Depth: Price cuts spur U.S. home sales, but market remains sluggish --- While monthly gain is largest since 2002, jobs picture clouds outlook</span>
</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>1734 words</div><div>28 January 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>20</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. HOME SALES registered their biggest monthly jump in nearly seven years in December, as cratering prices began to draw out more buyers and several major housing markets showed some signs of stabilizing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 6.5% rise in sales from November was attributed in part to strong sales of foreclosed homes. Economists say it is too early to suggest that broad improvement is at hand, though, and warned that the spring buying season is likely to be sluggish amid growing economic hardship. Indeed, the employment picture continued to darken Monday as U.S. employers announced at least another 65,000 layoffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said sales of previously occupied single-family homes, condominiums and cooperative homes in the U.S. reached a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.74 million units in December. Last month's rise was the largest since the early phase of the housing boom in January 2002 and a sharp rebound from the prior month, when sales plunged 9.4%, according to revised data from the Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But U.S. home sales were still down 3.5% from a year earlier. The trade group said 45% of transactions completed in December were "distress sales" by banks unloading foreclosed properties or homeowners selling for less money than they owe to lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The December figure "is by no means a sustainable type of improvement," said Ivy Zelman, chief executive of research firm Zelman &amp;Associates. She said the latest data represent a normal recovery from November's extremely weak performance and show that banks became more aggressive in selling foreclosed homes late last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For 2008 as a whole, sales dropped 13% from a year earlier to 4.91 million, the lowest since 1997.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are glimmers of hope. The Realtors said there were 3.68 million previously occupied homes listed for sale at the end of December, down 7.5% from a year earlier. Moratoriums on foreclosures by some lenders probably reduced the flow of such homes into the market late in the year, said Michelle Meyer, an economist at <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, The Wall Street Journal's quarterly survey of housing-market conditions in 28 major metropolitan areas in the U.S. shows that inventory levels dropped fastest in some places where foreclosures are attracting bargain hunters. These areas include Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, Sacramento and Orange County, Calif., as well as Denver and Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, U.S. home-price declines worsened in November, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home-price indexes released Tuesday, as numerous regions in the country saw record monthly drops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The freefall in residential real estate continued through November," said David M. Blitzer, chairman of S&amp;P's index committee. Both composite indexes and 11 of the 20 metropolitan areas reported record year-over-year declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of November, the 10-city index is down 27% from its mid-2006 peak and the 20-city is down 25%. The two indexes have fallen every month since August 2006, 28 straight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The indexes showed prices in 10 major metropolitan areas fell 19.1% in November from a year earlier and 2.2% from October. The drop marks the 10-city index's 14th-straight monthly report of a record decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage-interest rates for people in the U.S. who have good credit records and enough savings for a sizable down payment have fallen to around 5%, the lowest level in decades. Plunging prices have made housing much more affordable relative to incomes. On average, U.S. home prices are down about 19% since peaking in 2006, returning to levels recorded in 2004, the research firm First American CoreLogic reported Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many people who would like to take advantage of the lower prices find themselves unable to do so, however. Jae and Frank Shin of Phoenix bought a new three-bedroom home near a <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span> store in mid-2006 for about $280,000, and played it safe by making a 20% down payment. Now, they are keen to sell that home and move to a neighborhood with better schools and playgrounds for their two sons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ms. Shin screamed when her mortgage broker, Steve Walsh of Scout Mortgage, recently provided an estimate of the home's current value: $180,000 to $190,000. That is less than the Shins owe on their mortgage and means they can't refinance their loan or sell the home for enough to satisfy the lender. Until prices recover, Ms. Shin said, "we're stuck."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising unemployment and announcements of huge job cuts have sapped consumer confidence nationwide, discouraging some potential buyers from making a move. "People rightly feel less secure in their future income," said Richard K. Green, director of the Lusk Center for Real Estate at the University of Southern California, who believes the housing market won't recover until the unemployment rate stops rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several U.S. employers announced layoffs totaling 65,000 jobs on Monday, including 20,000 at <span class="companylink">Caterpillar Inc</span>. and 7,000 at <span class="companylink">Home Depot Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far this year, big U.S. employers have announced plans to shed more than 140,000 jobs, on top of the 2.5 million shed last year, the biggest drop since 1945.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That bodes ill for the home-shopping season that usually kicks off in February or March, the busiest time for housing sales in most of the U.S. Largely because of the weak job market, "we're looking for a very tepid spring market," said Jeffrey Otteau, president of Otteau Valuation Group, an East Brunswick, N.J., appraisal firm. Mr. Otteau doesn't expect prices in New Jersey to bottom out before the second or third quarter of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even when prices do level off, he said, he doesn't expect a rapid recovery. For one thing, any sign of an improving market will cause an increase in supply as people who had given up on selling their homes rush to put them back on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One key to the eventual recovery is how fast banks can sell their enormous holdings of foreclosed homes. <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span> estimates that U.S. banks and loan investors owned 844,700 foreclosed homes as of Dec. 1, up from 460,900 a year earlier. <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> forecasts that this inventory will peak at around 1.3 million homes in mid-2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all regions are suffering to the same degree. The Wall Street Journal's survey found that inventory in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale area at the end of 2008 was down 9% from a year earlier. But there are still enough homes on the market to last nearly 30 months at last year's sales rate. That is about five times the level considered healthy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Florida is still a train wreck," said Dr. Green of the Lusk Center. "It will be a long time before that market comes back."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In most big metropolitan areas, the supply of homes for sale is down from a year ago, an encouraging sign. But the inventory in New York's borough of Manhattan, which until recently was one of the few strong American housing markets, bloated 39% last year as Wall Street job losses crushed demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Areas with relatively lean supplies of homes in relation to recent sales include Boston, Washington, San Francisco, Sacramento and Orange County, Calif. That suggests these areas may recover more quickly than others once consumer confidence revives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But almost no one expects a quick turnaround. Orders of homes from major builders this year are likely to be about one-quarter of the level in 2005, the final year of the boom, says Daniel Oppenheim, an analyst at <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home price index, the mortgage payment on a median priced U.S. home has fallen to about 17% of average family income, in line with historical norms, from more than 25% two years ago, according to a recent report by economists at <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>. Even so, such factors as a glut of supply and "self-fulfilling expectations of further house price declines . . . are likely to push down home prices considerably further over the next two years," the <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They predict that house prices as measured by the Federal Housing Finance Agency will plunge 36% in the Miami metro area in the two years ending in the third quarter of 2010. They also anticipate big declines in the metro areas of Las Vegas (-21%), Los Angeles (-26%), Phoenix (-20%) and Washington (-20%), but increases in Dallas (7%), Houston (8%) and Denver (3%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, house-price fluctuations vary hugely from neighborhood to neighborhood, and some may show little or no decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though prices and interest rates have fallen, credit remains tight. Rob Weigand, a finance professor at Washburn University in Topeka, Kan., wants to buy a second home in Denver as an investment and place to stay when he visits relatives there. He is prepared to put 10% down in cash but found he would be required to pay more than $2,000 a year in mortgage insurance to get a $300,000 loan, despite his excellent credit record. So Mr. Weigand is holding off, saying lenders have now become too cautious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've gone crazy in the other direction," Mr. Weigand said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some people are finding it a good time to buy. John Haughom, an executive for <span class="companylink">PeaceHealth</span>, an operator of hospitals, recently bought a penthouse in a development called Atwater Place in the South Waterfront district of Portland, Ore. The 2,792-square-foot condominium was listed at just under $2 million and had sat empty since it was completed in August. With most units still unsold, Dr. Haughom said he was able to negotiate a discount of about 30%, adding, "The sellers are very flexible."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Haughom acknowledged that prices could fall more, but said, "We're in it for the long run." He believes today's economic woes could lead to high inflation and, if so, property will be a good investment. "Portland is going to continue to be a very desirable place to live."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, a bigger home isn't always a better one: Recent research suggests that homes being built today are getting smaller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average size of homes started in the third quarter of 2008 was 2,438 square feet, down from 2,629 square feet in the second quarter, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Similarly, the median size of homes started in the third quarter was 2,090, down from 2,291. The statistics confirm what the housing industry has suspected for a while.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've been hearing for a long time, 'Why is the home size not declining?'" said Gopal Ahluwalia, vice president of economic research for the National Association of Home Builders. He spoke about the trend at the International Builders' Show, held in Las Vegas last week. Anecdotally, he had heard smaller homes were being built as housing prices tumbled and the economy began to weaken. Still, "we never had data to back it up," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gayle Butler, editor-in-chief of Better Homes and Gardens, said that for many homeowners, it is not so much a matter of downsizing as "right-sizing," giving up big homes with unused space and buying a home that better fits their needs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Either by necessity or choice, they're willing to take a step back from the McMansions," she said at the Builders' Show. In fact, according to a survey conducted by the magazine, 32% of participants said they expected their new home to be either somewhat smaller or much smaller then the one they already live in, she said. The magazine's online study involved 733 potential new-home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders are responding to those consumer desires. According to the National Association of Home Builders, 88% of builders surveyed in January said they are building or planning to build a larger share of smaller homes. Eighty-nine percent said they're planning on building more lower-priced models.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As homes get smaller, home-owners are seeking to economize with the space they do have. Ms. Butler said she is seeing more interest in "Wii-sized spaces" -- family rooms that are flexible enough to accommodate a variety of activities, from video games to fitness systems. Outdoor kitchens and entertaining areas also continue to rise in popularity, she said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>1623 words</div><div>27 January 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Real Estate; A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home sales registered their biggest monthly jump in nearly seven years in December, as cratering prices began to draw out more buyers and several major housing markets showed some signs of stabilizing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 6.5% rise in sales from November was attributed in part to strong sales of foreclosed homes. Economists say it is too early to suggest that broad improvement is at hand, though, and warned that the spring buying season is likely to be sluggish amid growing economic hardship. Indeed, the employment picture continued to darken Monday as U.S. employers announced at least another 65,000 layoffs. ( See related article [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123296465005915061.html].)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors nonetheless seized on the whiff of good housing news, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average up more than 100 points before it retreated to close up 38.47 points, or 0.5%, at 8116.03.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said sales of previously occupied single-family homes, condominiums and cooperative homes reached a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.74 million units in December. Last month's rise was the largest since the early phase of the housing boom in January 2002 and a sharp rebound from the prior month, when sales plunged 9.4%, according to revised data from the Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But home sales were still down 3.5% from a year earlier. The trade group said 45% of transactions completed in December were "distress sales" by banks unloading foreclosed properties or homeowners selling for less money than they owe to lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The December figure "is by no means a sustainable type of improvement," said Ivy Zelman, chief executive of research firm Zelman &amp;Associates. She said the latest data represent a normal recovery from November's extremely weak performance and show that banks became more aggressive in selling foreclosed homes late last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For 2008 as a whole, sales dropped 13% from a year earlier to 4.91 million, the lowest since 1997.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are glimmers of hope. The Realtors said there were 3.68 million previously occupied homes listed for sale at the end of December, down 7.5% from a year earlier. Moratoriums on foreclosures by some lenders probably reduced the flow of such homes into the market late in the year, said Michelle Meyer, an economist at <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, The Wall Street Journal's quarterly survey of housing-market conditions in 28 major metropolitan areas shows that inventory levels dropped fastest in some places where foreclosures are attracting bargain hunters. These areas include Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, Sacramento and Orange County, Calif., as well as Denver and Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some Still 'Stuck'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, mortgage-interest rates for people who have good credit records and enough savings for a sizable down payment have fallen to around 5%, the lowest level in decades. Plunging prices have made housing much more affordable relative to incomes. On average, U.S. home prices are down about 19% since peaking in 2006, returning to levels recorded in 2004, the research firm First American CoreLogic reported Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many people who would like to take advantage of the lower prices find themselves unable to do so, however. Jae and Frank Shin of Phoenix bought a new three-bedroom home near a <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span> store in mid-2006 for about $280,000, and played it safe by making a 20% down payment. Now, they are keen to sell that home and move to a neighborhood with better schools and playgrounds for their two sons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ms. Shin screamed when her mortgage broker, Steve Walsh of Scout Mortgage, recently provided an estimate of the home's current value: $180,000 to $190,000. That is less than the Shins owe on their mortgage and means they can't refinance their loan or sell the home for enough to satisfy the lender. Until prices recover, Ms. Shin said, "we're stuck."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising unemployment and announcements of huge job cuts have sapped consumer confidence nationwide, discouraging some potential buyers from making a move. "People rightly feel less secure in their future income," said Richard K. Green, director of the Lusk Center for Real Estate at the University of Southern California, who believes the housing market won't recover until the unemployment rate stops rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several U.S. employers announced layoffs totaling 65,000 jobs on Monday, including 20,000 at <span class="companylink">Caterpillar Inc</span>. and 7,000 at <span class="companylink">Home Depot Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far this year, big U.S. employers have announced plans to shed more than 140,000 jobs, on top of the 2.5 million shed last year, the biggest drop since 1945.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That bodes ill for the home-shopping season that usually kicks off in February or March, the busiest time for housing sales in most of the U.S. Largely because of the weak job market, "we're looking for a very tepid spring market," said Jeffrey Otteau, president of Otteau Valuation Group, an East Brunswick, N.J., appraisal firm. Mr. Otteau doesn't expect prices in New Jersey to bottom out before the second or third quarter of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks Hold the Key</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even when prices do level off, he said, he doesn't expect a rapid recovery. For one thing, any sign of an improving market will cause an increase in supply as people who had given up on selling their homes rush to put them back on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One key to the eventual recovery is how fast banks can sell their enormous holdings of foreclosed homes. <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span> estimates that banks and loan investors owned 844,700 foreclosed homes as of Dec. 1, up from 460,900 a year earlier. <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> forecasts that this inventory will peak at around 1.3 million homes in mid-2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all regions are suffering to the same degree. The Wall Street Journal's survey found that inventory in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale area at the end of 2008 was down 9% from a year earlier. But there are still enough homes on the market to last nearly 30 months at last year's sales rate. That is about five times the level considered healthy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Florida is still a train wreck," said Dr. Green of the Lusk Center. "It will be a long time before that market comes back."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In most big metropolitan areas, the supply of homes for sale is down from a year ago, an encouraging sign. But the inventory in New York's borough of Manhattan, which until recently was one of the nation's few strong housing markets, bloated 39% last year as Wall Street job losses crushed demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Areas with relatively lean supplies of homes in relation to recent sales include Boston, Washington, San Francisco, Sacramento and Orange County, Calif. That suggests these areas may recover more quickly than others once consumer confidence revives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But almost no one expects a quick turnaround. Orders of homes from major builders this year are likely to be about one-quarter of the level in 2005, the final year of the boom, says Daniel Oppenheim, an analyst at <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home price index, the mortgage payment on a median priced U.S. home has fallen to about 17% of average family income, in line with historical norms, from more than 25% two years ago, according to a recent report by economists at <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>. Even so, such factors as a glut of supply and "self-fulfilling expectations of further house price declines ... are likely to push down home prices considerably further over the next two years," the <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They predict that house prices as measured by the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> will plunge 36% in the Miami metro area in the two years ending in the third quarter of 2010. They also anticipate big declines in the metro areas of Las Vegas (-21%), Los Angeles (-26%), Phoenix (-20%) and Washington (-20%), but increases in Dallas (7%), Houston (8%) and Denver (3%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, house-price fluctuations vary hugely from neighborhood to neighborhood, and some may show little or no decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though prices and interest rates have fallen, credit remains tight. Rob Weigand, a finance professor at Washburn University in Topeka, Kan., wants to buy a second home in Denver as an investment and place to stay when he visits relatives there. He is prepared to put 10% down in cash but found he would be required to pay more than $2,000 a year in mortgage insurance to get a $300,000 loan, despite his excellent credit record. So Mr. Weigand is holding off, saying lenders have now become too cautious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've gone crazy in the other direction," Mr. Weigand said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some people are finding it a good time to buy. John Haughom, an executive for <span class="companylink">PeaceHealth</span>, an operator of hospitals, recently bought a penthouse in a development called Atwater Place in the South Waterfront district of Portland, Ore. The 2,792-square-foot condominium was listed at just under $2 million and had sat empty since it was completed in August. With most units still unsold, Dr. Haughom said he was able to negotiate a discount of about 30%, adding, "The sellers are very flexible."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Haughom acknowledged that prices could fall more, but said, "We're in it for the long run." He believes today's economic woes could lead to high inflation and, if so, property will be a good investment. "Portland is going to continue to be a very desirable place to live."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For prospective home buyers, it's hard to ignore the sales pitch: Home values nationwide have fallen on average some 20%, while mortgage rates recently plumbed record lows below 5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the latest <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices, prices for existing single-family homes were down 23% from their 2006 peak in 20 cities as of October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is 5.12%, down from 5.48% a year ago, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. And 5/1 conforming adjustable-rate mortgages carry a 5.24% average rate, versus 5.13% last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But such rates don't mean lenders will go easy on prospective homeowners. House hunters need to have a credit score of at least 660 to 680 and be prepared to make a down payment of 20% or more, says Stu Feldstein of SMR Research, a financial-services research firm based in Hackettstown, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those who fit the bill, here are some tips for getting an even better deal on a home:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1 Don't hesitate to haggle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the glut of homes on the market, you shouldn't be afraid to low-ball an offer or negotiate other incentives, such as having the seller pay closing costs or including the washer and dryer with the home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before making an offer, find out how long the house has been on the market and why the seller is moving. If the house has been on the market for eight months or longer, the seller will probably be more prone to lowering the price, says Mr. Feldstein. Likewise, a seller who is eager to move -- say, because of a new job or another child on the way -- will probably be more flexible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2 Shop around for rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To land the lowest mortgage rate possible, get at least three competitive bids from lenders, says Danielle Babb, a real-estate analyst and professor of economics and statistics at Northcentral University in Arizona.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Be prepared to document income, assets and employment -- that means including your 1040 forms from the past couple of years, pay stubs, bank statements and even your employer's phone number. The more verification you provide, the less risky you appear to the lender, which will be more likely to refrain from tacking more fees or points on to your mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3 Tap new tax benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buy a house no later than June 30 and you may qualify for a new tax credit that at most equals the lesser of 10% of the home price or $7,500 for couples filing jointly and single people ($3,750 if you're married but filing separately).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are several catches, however. You're eligible only if you haven't owned a principal residence in the U.S. during the three years leading up to the purchase date. And you'll have to repay the credit over 15 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you claim the credit on your 2008 tax return, you'll have to start repaying it with the 2009 tax return. In short, the benefit to this credit is that it functions like a no-interest loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4 Think about rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before you make an offer, consider how the house's location will affect its value in the near and long term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cities and towns that haven't been hit very hard by foreclosures are likely to see home values increase much faster when the market recovers than areas flooded with "for sale" signs and foreclosures. Foreclosed homes sell for anywhere between 30% and 70% of their value, and that keeps the value of area homes from rebounding, says Ms. Babb.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Builder's Low Loan Rate May Fall Flat</span>
</div><div class="author">By Ruth Simon and Dawn Wotapka </div><div>882 words</div><div>24 January 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Real Estate; A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders have been clamoring for the federal government to push mortgage rates down further to jump-start the ailing housing market. Now <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers Inc</span>. has taken matters into its own hands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking to jolt paralyzed home buyers into action, Toll, a builder of luxury homes, on Wednesday began offering some buyers of new homes a 3.99% 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. That is more than a percentage point less than the average rate on such mortgages, currently 5.27%, according to HSH Associates in Pompton Plains, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It isn't unusual for builders with their own mortgage units to offer below-market rates as an incentive to sell homes. They can do this by making an upfront cash payment to the investor who buys the mortgage in a process known as a "buy down." Homeowners often make similar payments, known as points, to obtain a lower interest rate. The buy down is treated as a cost of sale for the builder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is eye-catching about Toll's offer is that the Horsham, Pa., company is offering the low rate for the life of the loan rather than for a few years, as some builders have done. Toll is offering the 3.99% fixed rate for loans of $417,000 or less that carry no points for the buyer. To qualify, borrowers need a credit score of 720 or higher and a 20% down payment. Toll is also offering reduced rates to borrowers with loan balances above the standard $417,000 limit for conforming loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"One of the things we've heard from consumers is that they want to wait until rates come down," says Don Salmon, chief executive of TBI Mortgage Co., Toll's mortgage subsidiary. "We're trying to figure out a catalyst to bring buyers off the sidelines."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rate cut comes as home builders brace for a dismal spring selling season. Many companies say they expect it will be even tougher to sell homes this year than in 2008, amid mounting foreclosures, rising job losses and collapsing consumer confidence. New home construction plunged to a record low in December, the Commerce Department reported Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Home Builders has been calling on the federal government to offer buyers of new and existing homes tax credits and a temporary interest-rate buy down in an effort to boost sales. But it isn't clear how much Toll's offer will spur purchases at a time when many people are worried about jobs and falling home prices. Others can't qualify for a mortgage, for instance, because their credit is bad or they don't have enough money for a down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"On balance, it's positive for the housing market," says David Berson, chief economist of mortgage insurer <span class="companylink">PMI Group Inc</span>. "But will it be enough to turn the tide? Probably not. At least for now, these other negatives will probably outweigh it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates began falling in late November after the federal government said it would step in to stabilize the mortgage market, but the rates have edged up recently. Rates are down from a recent high of 6.75% in mid-October, but up from 5.04% earlier this month. Lower rates are spurring traffic, builders say, but have yet to produce a big jump in sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average price of a home sold by Toll last year was $655,000. Roughly 70% of borrowers who financed their mortgages through Toll received a loan of $417,000 or less in the fiscal year ending Oct. 31, Mr. Salmon says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a $200,000 loan, it typically costs about $8,000 to buy down the mortgage rate by a full percentage point. Toll declined to say how much the program costs the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll isn't alone in offering lower rates. Metro Homes in Jersey City, N.J., began offering buyers in two of its condo projects a 3.99% 30-year fixed rate mortgage three months ago; last week, it dropped the rate to 3.75%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Hovnanian Enterprises Inc</span>. has offered a 30-year fixed 4.5% rate for three weeks and is "exploring the possibility of matching Toll's" rate for loans $417,000 and less, said Dan Klinger, president of <span class="companylink">K. Hovnanian American Mortgage</span>. The deal calls for buyers to pay a point, or 1% of the loan amount, but the builder has been paying that in many cases. <span class="companylink">M.D.C. Holdings Inc</span>.'s HomeAmerican Mortgage Corp. is offering a 4% 30-year fixed rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because Toll caters to move-up buyers, "the biggest issue is that buyers need to sell their existing homes," says <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> analyst Dan Oppenheim. "Toll customers also have more exposure to the equity markets than buyers of other builders."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders face stiff competition from bank-owned properties that are selling for big discounts. More than most builders, Toll has tried to hold its prices and instead focus on other incentives, such as upgrades and lower mortgage rates.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kelly Evans </div><div>462 words</div><div>23 January 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>10</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The battered U.S. housing sector is off to a rough start this year, as the real-estate market that led the nation into recession shows no signs yet of leading it back out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home construction fell sharply in December, the Commerce Department said Thursday, and a drop in permits for future projects suggests the declines will continue. Meanwhile, home-builder confidence is at a record low and the government's gauge of home prices, also released Thursday, showed accelerating declines nationwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction on new single- and multifamily homes sank 15.5% in December from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 550,000 units -- the lowest pace since monthly records began in 1959. The rate was down by nearly half from the pace seen in December 2007 as the slowdown continues to weigh heavily on the U.S. economy, which likely turned in its worst performance in a quarter-century during the final three months of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline in building activity partly reflects a massive overhang of unsold homes nationwide and a continuing stream of new foreclosures to the market. It also reflects reduced home-buying activity in general, amid rising unemployment and tight credit conditions. While mortgage rates have fallen to historic lows, it is unclear whether they are stimulating home buying or just boosting refinancing activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A gauge of future home-building activity -- permits granted for residential construction -- also sank in December, falling nearly 11% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 615,000 permits -- again a historic low. The glum outlook was echoed in the National Association of Home Builders' survey of builder confidence, released Wednesday, which slipped to a new low for January as an overwhelming share of respondents categorized sales activity as "poor."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are down 10.5% through November from their April 2007 peak, according to the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which released November figures Thursday. The agency tracks prices only on homes purchased with loans backed by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, which excludes many homes purchased with riskier mortgages, and its index has shown shallower price declines than other gauges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FHFA also reported that home prices fell a seasonally adjusted 1.8% nationwide in November from the previous month, the largest monthly drop yet and a sign that home-price declines continue to accelerate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate gauge of the weakening economy, new claims for unemployment benefits jumped last week as layoffs continued to mount. Jobless claims rose last week by a seasonally adjusted 62,000 to 589,000, the Labor Department said Thursday, matching the highest level seen in a quarter-century.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. housing starts fell in December for the sixth month in a row, bringing construction to a new low, according to a report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the number of U.S. workers filing new claims for state unemployment benefits rose more than expected last week to match the quarter-century high reached in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts decreased 15.5% compared with the prior month to a seasonally adjusted 550,000 annual rate, after dropping 15.1% in November to 651,000, the Commerce Department said Thursday.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LAS VEGAS -- The worst U.S. housing downturn since World War II is likely to deepen further this year, with no broad recovery until at least 2010, according to a consensus of building-industry economists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family-housing starts, which fell 40% to 617,000 in 2007, are expected to drop to about 441,000 this year -- the lowest since records have been kept -- according to the economic outlook of the National Association of Home Builders released Tuesday at the International Builders Show here. That would be a nearly 75% drop from the industry's highwater mark of 1.7 million single-family starts in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists from <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the government-backed lending agency, mortgage insurer <span class="companylink">PMI Group Inc</span>. and the Portland Cement Association trade group also predicted this year would be worse than 2008 in terms of starts and overall housing activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the problems for the industry, economists said, is an overhang of unsold homes brought on in large part by extensive job losses. The inventory of new homes on the market stands at 11.5 months, more than double the level normally required to encourage builders to begin building again, said Ed Sullivan, chief economist for the cement group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding to the woes, he and other economists said, is the likelihood that foreclosures will keep rising -- putting even more homes on the market -- as unemployment continues to rise this year. Frank Nothaft, chief economist for <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, predicted the U.S. unemployment rate will jump to 8.7% by the fourth quarter of 2009 from 7.2% as of December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said lending remains so tight that many consumers won't be able to take advantage of declining housing prices and mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Portland Cement Association held a separate news conference Tuesday at which its chief economist sounded even more pessimistic about prospects for a recovery. "I see another full two years almost before a significant gain," Mr. Sullivan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even prospects for a massive federal economic-stimulus plan failed to buoy spirits at the builders' show. One problem with the $775 billion stimulus plan proposed by President Barack Obama, some economists said, is that it would move too slowly to help much with this year's housing market. Some tax cuts envisioned under the plan, they said, would most likely be used by consumers to help pay down personal debt, rather than for big-ticket items such as houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Longer term, industry economists said, housing should rebound strongly. Demand by the children of baby boomers is expected to fuel home sales over time, as is overall population growth.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate investments by pension funds and other big investors lost a record 11% of their value in the fourth quarter of 2008, preliminary data for a closely watched index show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But market participants said that values are almost certain to fall further, highlighting a debate over how property investments should be appraised and how appraisal techniques affect the real-estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The quarterly drop in the open-end discretionary core-equity fund index compiled by the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries is the biggest since the inception of the index in 1978. For full-year 2008, the index -- which tracks investments in stable, high-quality real estate by large real-estate investment funds that cater to big investors like pension funds -- fell 10%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More risky, highly levered real-estate investments likely are in for a bigger hit. Opportunistic funds, which buy properties around the world using a lot of debt with the hope of reselling them at a big profit, posted a total return of minus 12.3% in the third quarter of 2008, according to preliminary data released last week by council and the Townsend Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The declines in value come as investors in commercial real estate grapple with barely functioning debt markets and falling demand for office, retail, hotel and warehouse space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industry leaders have made trips to Washington to lobby for federal aid, arguing that the credit crunch could force even owners of healthy, well-operated properties into default on debt that is due this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The appraised values, however, are only part of the story: Investors would be hard-pressed to sell a building these days at anywhere near what they paid as recently as a year ago. And because appraised values in the U.S. still are relatively high, few investors are willing to sell if they don't have to. That has virtually frozen the U.S. commercial-property market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.K., where appraisers have been much more aggressive in marking down property values, some investors said the commercial real-estate market is showing signs of restarting.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both the U.S. and U.K. property markets have been hit by many of the same problems -- a credit crunch and global recession -- battering commercial real estate. But U.K. prices have been marked down more. A monthly index by <span class="companylink">Investment Property Databank</span> in London shows that total returns on U.K. property investments were down 23% for the past 12 months as of December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the most prominent U.S. index for privately held commercial property, the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries' Property Index, posted a 5.3% one-year total return as of the end of the third quarter of 2008, the most recent data available.

</div><div class="author">By Dana Mattioli </div><div>1427 words</div><div>21 January 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Real Estate; B7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now it's a renter's market, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the housing downturn deepens, rental rates are falling in many major U.S. cities, including New York and Los Angeles, and tenants are finding they have greater leeway to renegotiate their leases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early in the housing crisis, former homeowners were starting to rent again, supporting demand for rentals. Now, with more newly constructed condos being converted into rental units, landlords are struggling to keep buildings occupied. Apartment rents nationwide fell 0.4% in the fourth quarter from the third quarter -- the first drop since 2003, according to <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>., a New York City-based real-estate research company. Apartment vacancies rose to 6.6% in the quarter from 5.7% a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some major cities, the declines have been far steeper. In Manhattan, rents fell on almost all kinds of apartments in 2008. Rents of studio apartments fell 7.4%, and rents of one-bedrooms and two-bedrooms in buildings without a doorman fell 5.5% and 5.6%, respectively, according to a report released Tuesday by the Real Estate Group of New York, a Manhattan-based brokerage firm. In Miami, 60% of rents decreased in the fourth quarter, and 45% of rents in Los Angeles declined. Rents did buck the trend in a few cities. During 2008, rents increased 2.3% in Pittsburgh and 4.2% in Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overall weak rental market has emboldened a number of tenants to start negotiating with their landlords. Richard Laermer, owner of a public-relations firm, was heading toward 2009 with the prospect of lower income and a steep monthly rent -- $4,700 for a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment in midtown New York City. So in November, he asked his landlord for a break. Even though it was months before his lease was up, he won a $200-a-month rent decrease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Owners realize that there isn't the job growth necessary to sustain high demand for rentals, and they have to be much more realistic" about price, says Daniel Baum, chief operating officer of the Real Estate Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seeking a Discount</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some landlords and property managers say they have never encountered so many tenants looking to bargain. Mitchell Rattner, president of Home Equity Savers in Riverwoods, Ill., owns 50 condo complexes and homes around Chicago with a partner and says that requests by tenants to negotiate were almost unheard of until fairly recently. In the past 10 months, he's discounted two of his tenants' rents midlease to keep them from moving out. "If they're good payers, we will give them a discount," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even in a positive climate for renters, there are steps people should take before trying to renegotiate a lease. Mr. Baum of New York's Real Estate Group suggests seeking out evidence of similar apartments in your neighborhood that are being rented for less. Present these findings to your landlord to bolster your case for a lower rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Offering to extend your lease can also help persuade a landlord to make a deal. Mr. Laermer told his landlord that he'd stay an extra year if he worked with him to lower the price midcontract; Mr. Laermer also hinted that he'd leave the building otherwise. Of course, if you plan to play hardball and threaten to leave, be sure you are prepared to move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gentle persistence can pay off. Michael Soon Lee, a broker who owns Realty Unlimited in the San Francisco area, worked with a couple in November to lower their rent. The wife had recently been laid off, and the $1,800 monthly rent was too high. At first, the apartment manager refused to budge on price. But Mr. Lee advised the couple to approach the property's owner, who reduced their rent to $1,400, asking only that they add another year to their lease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Worried Email</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jared Wilk, a Realtor at Wilk &amp;Welch Associates, a real-estate developer and property manager in the Boston area, recently got an email from a tenant at one of his apartment complexes after her rent check bounced. The tenant was worried that she'd have to break her lease for financial reasons. Since she had rented the three-bedroom apartment for a year and a half, Mr. Wilk told her he would work with her to lower her rent or, if she wanted to find someone to sublet her apartment, he would waive the customary fee. Mr. Wilk says he was willing to make a deal with his tenant because of her steady track record -- and the fact that he wouldn't be able to rent the apartment for much more than the discount he would offer her.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may be easiest to negotiate in cities like Miami and Las Vegas that have been hit hard by home foreclosures. There, renters are getting a boost from a "shadow supply" of rental units: Investors who have scooped up foreclosed homes are renting them out so they don't have to sell into a declining market. Such investors "are undercutting a lot of the normal rental rates so they can attract tenants quicker," says Elizabeth Olds, real-estate economist with Boston-based Property &amp;Portfolio Research Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some California cities, vacancy rates are being boosted by the conversion of new condo projects into rentals, says Patrick S. Duffy, principal of MetroIntelligence Real Estate Advisors, a real-estate consulting firm based in Los Angeles. In downtown L.A., where there are a lot of new condos, the vacancy rate was almost 10% in the fourth quarter, compared with an L.A.-wide vacancy rate of 4.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signs: 'Now Renting'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For renters, it pays to be aware of your surroundings and look for indications that management may be willing to work with you. Blake McCrossin, a 27-year-old who works for an entertainment magazine in Los Angeles, noticed that the Hollywood apartment building he lived in for three years was having some difficulties. The building had once had a waiting list, but now the outside wall displayed "Now Renting" signs. The building maintenance and landscaping were suffering, and the desk security was becoming scarce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March 2008, he approached the management and explained that the $1,350 he was spending each month on his half of a two-bedroom unit was too expensive, since he had just had a pay cut. The landlords, eager to keep him and his roommate in the building, lowered the rent to $2,390 -- $1,195 a month each -- and granted both renters a month-to-month contract. (Mr. McCrossin moved seven months later, after the complex became more run-down.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fear of losing a good tenant is often enough to make landlords reconsider their rent. Jenna Carpenter, a 28-year-old living in a $2,000-per-month one-bedroom apartment on New York's Lower East Side, didn't plan to renegotiate her contract. But once she told her landlord she didn't plan to renew her lease in March, he offered to lower her rent. They are now negotiating a cut of between $300 and $400 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if your landlord won't adjust your rent midlease, he or she may offer concessions. Ms. Olds suggests asking for free use of amenities that would normally carry a cost, such as a gym or pool, or even asking to be upgraded to a better apartment with a great view or more square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gift Cards and Appliances</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time apartment-hunters can also nab lower rental prices and concessions. Some apartment buildings are luring potential renters with gift cards, appliances, reduced rates and concessions such as free pool and gym use. Building owners fear that this summer's crop of college grads will move back home with their parents rather than renting apartments, says Jessica Scully, vice president of Scully Company, a property-management company with units in Pennsylvania, Florida, New Jersey and Connecticut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company is offering up to two months of free rent to new tenants at some locations, Ms. Scully says. It is also starting to work with tenants whose contracts are about to expire, offering a free month of rent when they renew at some locations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In the apartment business before the downturn, it wasn't a 'Let's make a deal' climate," says Ms. Scully. Now, "it's something we are seeing more of."</p>

Direst predictions aside, no one knows whether housing troubles will lead to an irreparable collapse of the nation's economy. But today's problems do clearly signal that home-owning can no longer serve one of the roles it has had for the last 60 years -- as Americans' principal means of building wealth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the foreseeable future, house prices are likely to remain stagnant or, in many markets, to continue declining. All but the most optimistic market watchers believe that prices won't bottom out for at least two or three years and that they're unlikely to start going back up until far into the next decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So many of us home buyers -- and most of us are home buyers and not home owners, because we are still paying off our long-term mortgages -- are facing broad double-digit home-value declines of a magnitude quite unlike any the U.S. has seen since the 1930s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as in any downturn in any other market -- stocks, oil, gold, even tulips -- there will be winners and losers. Here's a quick rundown of how you may stack up:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time home buyers. This could turn out to be the greatest "buyer's market" in U.S. history. Smart, cool-headed house shopping could well land you in your dream home at half or less what you might have spent five years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with cheaper prices, today's twentysomethings are also likely to get a demographic break when it comes time for them to buy their houses. That's because the huge and aging Baby Boom generation will be leaving a plentiful supply of homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So don't listen to anyone who tells you that you must buy a house now. You have years to save your money and prepare to buy a home before prices will start to tick up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early-cycle home buyers. It could be rough. If you bought your first house within the past 10 years, the good news is that you face a new, much more affordable move-up market. But the bad news is that your home value could fall so much that you will lose most of your modest equity and could be "upside down," with a mortgage balance much greater than the market value of the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take the price you paid for your house and cut it by 25% ($300,000 - 25% = $225,000). That's about the hit that home owners can count on taking in this market -- wiping out bubble-era appreciation and, for recent buyers, their down payments, too. If at that 25%-off value, however, you still have substantial equity or are about even, then you will probably be able to ride out the storm, provided you have a steady job and aren't facing unmanageably high interest resets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just be prepared to stay where you are for a long time. Continue saving for the long term and accelerate your mortgage payments so you increase your equity and reduce your long-term interest expenses. Every dollar you pay on your mortgage balance returns at least the interest you pay to borrow it. That may be the only return you see on your house for a long time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Midcycle home buyers. If you entered the housing market in the late 1980s or early '90s, even if you have moved up since your first home, you probably have sufficient equity in your house to weather all but a doomsday decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So if you feel you really want to move up to a nicer house and want to take advantage of the downturn, you will have to scale back your expectations on the price you will get for your home. On the plus side, the home you want to buy will be cheaper, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you have the cash to buy a new house without selling your existing one, you are in a good position to move up -- you will be able to drive a very good bargain and get your move-up home at a big markdown. But be careful: You don't want to be caught trading up -- and taking on more debt -- on an asset that's declining in value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you can't make a great deal on your new house -- 30% or more off the bubble-era value -- you shouldn't move. Take a look at better using the space in your existing home to make the most of what you have.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late-cycle buyers and home owners. The market is most unlikely to eat away more than just a few years of price appreciation (great years though they were!).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you entered the housing market before the first Bush administration, you are probably within sight of paying off your mortgage and are eyeing new uses for your monthly mortgage check.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if you have moved up once or twice and are still several years from paying off the mortgage loan, you probably have sufficient equity to weather this down market. Finish paying off your loan and try to save more for your retirement in 10 to 15 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you are still working and are no longer paying for your house, you're probably now in a position to stash away cash at a prodigious rate. That's good. You'll need it. You won't be able to count on selling your house for the kind of money that you had hoped would fund your retirement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you are already retired, you will have to rethink any plans you had about selling or borrowing against your home equity as part of your retirement savings.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Stephen Miller </div><div>1067 words</div><div>17 January 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Business; A5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a verve appropriate to his Texas heritage, uncanny foresight and a drive that an associate once described as "dealaholic," Trammell Crow was the biggest real-estate developer in the nation in the 1970s and '80s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Determined to hold on to what he built -- a personal mantra was "the one who sells is wrong" -- he also became what The Wall Street Journal described at the time as "America's biggest landlord."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his hometown, he built such landmarks as the <span class="companylink">Dallas Market Center</span> -- 10 million square feet of exhibition and office space -- as well as the 1,606-room Anatole Hotel and a score of others. "As much as any single person, he made Dallas what it is," the Dallas Morning News editorialized on his death Wednesday at age 94.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Crow's legacy crisscrossed the country, as he created what may have been the first truly national development company, with offices in 100 American cities as well as in Europe, South America and Asia. Among his developments outside Texas are the Peachtree Center in Atlanta and the Embarcadero Center in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Crow was among the first to treat property as a commodity and build commercial real estate on speculation -- at first warehouses and trade marts -- putting up the building and then finding tenants. Most developers built for a client and sold out when the project was done. Where conventional wisdom dictated that tenants should be signed up for the long term, he insisted on short leases, counting on rising prices to increase rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Underlying the staggering 500 million square feet of real estate his company estimates it has built was an unusual business model in which young business school graduates on paltry salaries vied to do deals and achieve partnership, which meant they would directly profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Become an owner and things improve," Mr. Crow told the Journal in 1986, adding, "I guess that's the way human beings are created." Trammell Crow Co.'s energy reflected its owner's temperament.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Just as remarkable as Crow's ability to raise money is his bewilderingly complex organization -- if, indeed, the term organization can be accurately applied," Fortune magazine reported in 1973.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When hard times came in the late 1980s, Trammell Crow Co. had to retrench, and many partners left. The company concentrated for a time on third-party services such as management and brokerage, then returned to being a top developer. It was acquired by <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis Group Inc</span>. in 2006. Ownership of many of Mr. Crow's premier developments, including trade marts in Brussels and Dallas and the Hilton Anatole, remained with his Crow Holdings, whose assets are estimated in the billions of dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Never a hat-wearer and seldom in the media spotlight, Mr. Crow came from a background that belied the luxurious shopping centers and hotels he would build. A bookkeeper's son in a large family, he studied to be a CPA in night school while working day jobs including chicken plucker and bank teller. He served as a cost inspector in the Navy stationed in New Orleans during World War II, then briefly ran a <span class="companylink">North American Van Lines</span> franchise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While working at a grain silo owned by his father-in-law in 1948, Mr. Crow found himself in charge of renting out the firm's excess warehouse space. When one potential renter, Ray-O-Vac Co., needed more space, he built a warehouse with room to spare and found a new client, Decca Records Inc., to fill the rest. He instantly became a "confirmed gambler, a speculative builder," he told biographer William Bragg Ewald Jr.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Warehouses in rapidly expanding Dallas were a good investment. The city was such fertile ground for developers that two other giant national firms, <span class="companylink">Lincoln Property Co</span>. and Vantage Cos., each founded by former Crow associates, got their starts there, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon, Mr. Crow was doing business in Atlanta and Denver. In 1955, he opened the Dallas Decorative Center, a 130,000-square-foot space. The building became the hub of the <span class="companylink">Dallas Market Center</span>, an industrial park Mr. Crow developed over three decades that includes giant markets for furniture, men's and women's wear, a world trade center and the "Infomart," based on Britain's 19th Century Crystal Palace, a million-square-foot facility that is currently home to 110 technology companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His company built giant atrium hotels, plazas and hospitals as well as more-plebian strip malls, tract housing and even trailer parks. Once, when a partner showed him a city inventory report showing that his company owned over a half-million unleased square feet, he said, "Looks like you overbuilt St. Louis."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dubbed the largest private landlord in the country in 1971 by Forbes, Mr. Crow was sensitive to the business cycle. In a legendary meeting with creditors in 1977, Mr. Crow offered them a choice: new terms or a stack of keys and deeds to his properties he'd placed on the table in front of him. He got his terms, but also agreed to replace himself as CEO of his company with a protege, J. McDonald Williams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From then on, by all accounts, Trammell Crow Co. was a more orderly place. The firm rebounded in the 1980s, even as Mr. Crow stepped back and turned many responsibilities for his private business over to his son, Harlan Crow. Retirement for the senior Mr. Crow looked like a heady career for most. In 1981, he founded Wyndham Co., which became one of the nation's largest hotel chains. After Wyndham went public in 1997, he concentrated on tree farms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long active in politics, Mr. Crow was waiting at his Dallas trade mart in 1963 for John F. Kennedy to arrive for a luncheon visit the day the president was assassinated. Later, Mr. Crow would be a Republican stalwart, a close friend of Gerald Ford, and would help lure the 1984 convention to Dallas. President Ronald Reagan stayed in a suite at the Anatole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A collection of Qing dynasty jades and other Asian art Mr. Crow amassed with his wife, Margaret, is open to the public in the Dallas Arts District.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I cannot say why it is," Mr. Crow once said, pointing to his heart, "but these objects move me."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years ago, Louis Gonda was a billionaire. Then in September, <span class="companylink">American International Group Inc</span>., the company from which Mr. Gonda derived the bulk of his wealth, collapsed, its shares falling from nearly $60 a share in January 2008 to less than $2.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worth an estimated $1.4 billion according to the March 2008 issue of Forbes magazine, Mr. Gonda is selling assets. About a month ago, he put his Beverly Hills, Calif., mansion, an eight-bedroom brick Georgian he's owned for more than 20 years, on the market for $42 million. Within a few days Mr. Gonda lowered the price to $35 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an email, Mr. Gonda says that with his five children grown, he and his wife plan to travel more and no longer need the home. Situated on 1½ acres and a block from the iconic Beverly Hills Hotel, the house has a rectangular pool, a tennis court and a five-car garage, says Mr. Gonda's real-estate agent, Zach Goldsmith, of Hilton &amp;Hyland, an affiliate of Christie's Great Estates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, Mr. Gonda sold a rare beachfront parcel in Playa del Rey, a Los Angeles beachfront community, for $2.4 million, says listing agent Dan Christian, of Shorewood Realtors. Mr. Christian says Mr. Gonda had bought the plot a year before and razed the existing house to make way for a new structure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gonda notes that his family has other homes that it is not selling. "The AIG collapse has hurt hundreds of thousands of shareholders and employees. I am not an exception and prudent management dictates that nonessential, non-income-producing assets be sold first," he says in an email. He adds that six years ago his family began diversifying away from AIG and the stock market, a move that "has served us well."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The carnage in the upper echelons of finance is hitting the high-end real-estate market, particularly in traditional finance centers. In Manhattan, the fourth quarter showed a sharp increase in the inventory of homes costing $3 million and up, according to several brokerage reports. Many of the listings were purchased just a few years earlier and have been recently renovated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Some <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns</span> stuff hit the market" in the fall, says Meredyth Hull Smith, of Sotheby's, referring to the collapsed investment bank. London brokers say they're also beginning to see financiers selling in the desirable Chelsea and Kensington areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a stark reversal of fortune, particularly for financiers whose appetite for amenities like 24-hour concierge service and gated estates drove prices to dizzying heights. Now, many find themselves needing to downsize in an increasingly glutted high-end market, which is falling so rapidly brokers say it's difficult to discern how listings should be priced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, not every finance chief is selling a home because of the crisis. But all sellers are pitching their homes in a changed world. "It's a terrible time to list right now," says Wilbur Gonzalez, of Brown Harris Stevens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In early November, Scott Freidheim, former chief administrative officer at <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span>, put his just-purchased Greenwich, Conn., mansion up for sale for $13.75 million, according to Greenwich listing records. He and his wife bought it a year earlier for $12.4 million. The house is also for rent. The sale is tied to Mr. Freidheim's relocation to Chicago, where he is now executive vice president of operating and support businesses at <span class="companylink">Sears Holdings Corp</span>., says his real-estate agent, Joe Barbieri, of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others selling include Anthony Piszel, the former chief financial officer of <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, who put his Maryland Eastern Shore house up for sale in September for $5 million, less than two years after he bought it. He declined to comment via his listing agent, Charles Mangold Sr., of Benson &amp;Mangold. In Nantucket, Mass., <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>. Co-President Jon Winkelried put his summer home up for sale last fall for $55 million, but has since cut the price, according to his listing agent, Linda Bellevue, of Congdon &amp;Coleman Real Estate, who declined to comment further citing a confidentiality agreement. He didn't return a call to his office seeking comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joe Gregory, former president of Lehman, is selling a home in Bridgehampton, N.Y., for $32.5 million. Mr. Gregory purchased the home for $19 million in January 2007. Reached on his cellphone, he declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Palm Beach, Fla., where a local country club was ground zero for Bernard Madoff, perpetrator of an alleged Ponzi scheme, two of his investors have sold condos at The Breakers for $8.5 million and $7 million, respectively, according to Nadine House, an agent who specializes in the development. One alleged victim is also selling at the Sun &amp;Surf development, according to agent Dorothy "Rusty" Engels-Gulden.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rapid reversal of fortunes in commercial real estate is taking down yet another sector: apartment complexes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owners and developers of multifamily buildings are trying to stay afloat as the deteriorating economy and escalating job losses create difficulties in raising rents and shortfalls in projected revenues from these buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While sharp declines in retail and office sectors of commercial real estate have commanded attention in recent months, some analysts say deterioration in the multifamily sector is quickly catching up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A downturn in this sector also drags in housing mortgage giants <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, which are already hurting from losses in subprime and other risky home loans. Together, the two mortgage giants have nearly $200 billion of these loans on their books.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"On a broader scale, these loans are performing well relative to other segments in the market," said David Cardwell, vice president of capital markets at the National Multi Housing Council, a Washington group representing apartment owners. "But conventional wisdom on apartments is that it follows the trend in jobs. It takes a few months for job losses to trickle into the rental market, as people double up in apartments or move in with their folks."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the government reported that the U.S. jobless rate rose 0.4 percentage point to 7.2% for December. Less than a year ago, the rate stood at just 5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the multifamily sector's problems center on troubles in converting apartments to condominiums, as is the case in Miami, or on the challenges in converting rent-controlled units to market-rate apartments, as in New York's Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Florida, California, Arizona and Nevada, the flood of unsold condominiums entering the apartment market and is lowering rents in those areas, <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span> analysts say. That has resulted in lower revenues for owners, which in some cases is making it more difficult to keep up with mortgage payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, in New York, aggressive revenue projections and poor underwriting have dragged some recently sold large properties into trouble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, the $222.5 million loan taken by Rockpoint Group and Stellar Management to purchase the Riverton Apartments was transferred to special servicing in August as the buyers warned of an imminent default of the loan. By December, they had fallen behind in their mortgage payments. The 1,228-unit rent-controlled complex in Harlem is converting to market-rent units at a much slower pace than expected, according to a Moody's Investors Service report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time of the loan securitization in 2007, reserves of $48.3 million were set aside for any shortfalls in debt service and property renovation. By September, the reserves had fallen to $10.8 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, at the Peter Cooper Village-Stuyvesant Town property on Manhattan's East Side, only 37% of the units were converted to market rents as of September, compared with 28.5% at the time of the loan securitization, according to <span class="companylink">Moody's</span>. In 2006, at the time of the purchase by Tishman Speyer and Blackrock Realty Advisors, nearly half of the apartments were expected to be converted by 2008. The loan's $590 million reserve had dwindled to $200 million by September, which is expected to be depleted by the end of the third quarter of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November, the delinquency rate on securitized loans to apartment and condominium properties rose to 1.9%, a sharp jump from the 0.9% at the start of the year, according to Real-point LLC, a Horsham, Pa., rating firm that analyzes commercial-property mortgages and financing. Realpoint will have December data available at the end of this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Delinquent multifamily loans now add up to $3.17 billion and make up nearly 45% of the delinquencies affecting the nearly $1 trillion commercial mortgage-backed securities, Realpoint research shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, serious delinquency rates on multifamily loans doubled to 0.21% in October 2008 from 0.1% in January.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California's Inland Empire, the two-county region that stretches east of Los Angeles, has gone from a booming development smorgasbord to a basket case in a few short years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Riverside-San Bernardino area's unemployment level rose to 9.5% in November, tying with Detroit to lay claim to the highest unemployment rate of any large U.S. metropolitan area, according to the Labor Department. Third-quarter home-foreclosure rates were the third-highest of the nation's metros surveyed by RealtyTrac and the area's median single-family home price fell 39.4% to $227,200 in the third quarter from a year earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Inland Empire's commercial real-estate market also is by no means the picture of health. Roughly one-fifth of its office market is now vacant, store rents are plummeting and a rising number of warehouses are emptying as retailers have filed for bankruptcies and imports into the nearby ports of Los Angeles have slumped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, as in many parts of the country, for now the downturn of commercial property in this region isn't as severe as that of its residential sector and job market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home to about 4.2 million people, the Inland Empire was favored in recent years by new residents and many industrial investors drawn to its expanse of relatively affordable land near Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the region's commercial market isn't yet topping out the nation's various misery indexes, but it appears likely things will get worse before they get better. "We don't know when and where the bottom is," says Tim O'Rourke, executive vice president with <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>'s industrial group in Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. O'Rourke says the Inland Empire industrial market is still viewed as having long-term promise due to the area's above-average population growth and location. But as retail bankruptcies mount, an increasing amount of distribution space is going vacant, including a warehouse in Rancho Cucamonga previously occupied by Wickes Furniture Co., he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"></p><pre class="articlePre">                                                Fourth   quarter

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Warehouse vacancies in the third quarter remained among the country's lowest, even after roughly doubling over the past 12 months, according to Boston-based Property &amp;Portfolio Research Inc., a real-estate research firm. Harder hit are metrowide office vacancies, which rose above 20%, and fourth-quarter retail rents, which had the third-highest percentage decline of 76 major metros tracked by New York-based <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>., a real-estate research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Delinquencies on commercial mortgages packaged and sold as bonds, which represent nearly a third of the commercial real-estate debt market, suggest the Inland Empire's retail market is getting hit particularly hard by the downturn, as evidenced by delinquencies on commercial mortgage-backed securities, or CMBS. A study of delinquencies in the region's largest cities and towns showed four retail properties with delinquent CMBS loans valued at a total of $165 million, according to Richard Parkus, head of research on such bonds for <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were no delinquent office, warehouse, apartment or hotel loans in the region, according to the CMBS survey. But the retail problems gave the market an aggregate commercial delinquency rate of 3.8% as of December, well above the overall national delinquency rate of 1.2%, Mr. Parkus says. "Retail is going to get slammed in the Inland Empire, and it's already starting," Mr. Parkus says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That outlook for the office and warehouse sector is also looking tougher. Financial companies are still emptying office space, including about 265,000 square feet in Rancho Cucamonga to be vacated by a unit of <span class="companylink">Citigroup Inc</span>. in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New supply also will raise competition for shrinking warehouse users. While most public companies have ended any speculative building in the area, some 7.4 million square feet of warehouse facilities are expected to be completed this year, the highest volume of major markets tracked by PPR in the U.S.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I started looking at condominium listings in Chicago in June, when we found out that my husband had matched into a three-year cardiology fellowship at the University of Illinois at Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scenario seemed ideal: As first-time buyers we didn't have anything we needed to sell into this down market. After two years in a nondescript Philadelphia apartment and six years in dark, overpriced New York City apartments with unreliable radiator heat, ancient fixtures and the occasional unwelcome small furry visitor, I had dreams of sprawling two-bedroom units. We would grill on our back deck, toss the food scraps down the garbage disposal and retire to our central air-conditioned bedroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With visions of granite countertops and double sinks, we headed west at the end of November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the latest Case Shiller numbers, prices are down about 10% in Chicago from last year – though they are still 40% higher than in 2000 (" Case Shiller Numbers, By Metro Area [http://blogs.wsj.com/developments/2008/12/30/case-shiller-numbers-by-metro-area/]").</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, I quickly discovered that a 10% drop in Chicago didn't necessarily translate into a similar decline in the neighborhoods where we wanted to live, where prices have held relatively steady. We were interested in three areas: Lakeview, with its tree lined streets, multiple elevated train lines and throngs of stores and restaurants. Wicker Park, once ruled by artsy hipsters but slowly being overtaken by the stroller-pushing set. We also decided to check out a couple of options close to downtown, where condos were smaller but I might be able to walk to work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to sales data, the median condo price in Lakeview has hovered in the low $400,000s in recent months, close to unchanged in the past year. In West Town, which includes the Wicker Park neighborhood, the median has bounced around in the mid to high $300,000s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Value has held up pretty well" in Lakeview and Wicker Park, says Dennis Rodkin, who pens the real-estate blog Deal Estate [http://www.chicagomag.com/Radar/Deal-Estate/] for Chicago Magazine and has covered the market for 17 years. With very few foreclosures and many sellers content to hang on until they get close to their price, "the deals aren't in those neighborhoods." Unlike formerly red-hot markets like Miami and San Diego, Chicago "never goes up as much, so we don't have as far to fall," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We decided we could afford to spend about $400,000 for a two-bedroom apartment – we wanted two bathrooms, parking and an outside spot for a grill -- and would put 20% down, if not a little more. To conserve cash, we enlisted Redfin [http://Redfin.com], an online brokerage that splits the real-estate commission -- generally 2.5% or 3% of the sale price -- evenly with buyers. If a Redfin agent earns $10,000 from a deal, the buyer nets $5,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In exchange, we did all of the early legwork, researching neighborhoods and searching the company's database for properties we liked. We picked the units we wanted to see, and a Redfin agent took us out for tours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Armed with a tabbed binder full of property details, a camera and a tape measure, we headed out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some homeowners and their Realtors seemed to exist in an alternate real-estate universe. One 80-year-old unit with soaring ceilings and a lovely bay window desperately needed refinished floors, new bathroom fixtures and basically an entire new kitchen. Though the condo had been on the market for six months and the owner had already moved out, the price had barely budged. It was listed at the top of our range at $424,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One gorgeous Lakeview unit sported a sprawling two-story living room, with a brand new open kitchen and a roof deck with downtown's high rises glittering in the distance. The original listing price was $485,000, but it had been cut twice, quickly, to $425,000. It seemed too good to be true. It was: Though it was listed as having two bathrooms, it only had one and a half.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Time and again, we saw agents trying to avoid slashing prices. Thanks to Redfin's Web site, we could see when listing agents pulled units off the market and relisted them two days later at the same price, trying to make it look like a new listing. Other agents would advertise price drops when in reality they decided to change the listing and charge separately for the parking. A $425,000 condo would look like it was cut to $400,000, but the fine print would say parking was an extra $25,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every unit, it seemed, had some sort of fatal flaw. A gorgeous top-floor apartment in a high rise close to downtown, listed at $425,000 with floor-to-ceiling windows and views stretching far into the horizon, boasted marble bathrooms and top-of-the-line appliances. It had only two tiny closets. The owners, the listing agent informed us, solved that problem by renting a storage unit down the road.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An airy Wicker Park unit with a slate bathroom and 20-foot balcony looked straight out over the train tracks, and the whole building shook when the train passed by. We were sort of endeared by the gritty urban vista, but even the bargain price -- $385,000 -- wasn't low enough for me to face the idea of being lulled to sleep by screeching train brakes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in a down market, perfection, it seemed, cost about $100,000 more than we were willing to pay. The notion of the ultimate buyers' market started to fade. This wasn't the Arizona exurbs, battered by foreclosures and short sales. These sellers were convinced their homes were worth as much as they paid for them two or three years ago. Even when properties had been sitting on the market for months, the owners' unwillingness to budge betrayed a psychological barrier. While the market didn't feel terrible, it definitely felt unsettled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately a clear favorite emerged. In picturesque central Lakeview, listed at $425,000, there was a second-floor, like-new unit with an open kitchen, double sinks in the master bath and a private deck in back – but an uncovered parking spot that would surely be a drag in Chicago's endless, snowy winters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If everything goes according to plan, in a few months, we'll be moving in. We're paying $403,000 on a list price of $425,000. The seller purchased the unit in 2006 for $455,000 (the original list price was $450,000) and according to the data, the neighborhood has held its value since then. Nevertheless, with the housing market looking weaker by the day, doubt has set in. Could we have gotten it for $399,000? $396,000, even? Maybe. But for the moment, we don't care. We can imagine cooking dinner in the open kitchen, relaxing with friends in the open great room. We can imagine it as our home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We might change our minds, though, when we're digging our compact car out of that uncovered parking spot next winter.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the boom days of 2006, Ryan D'Agostino, then a writer for Money magazine (now an editor at Esquire), had a quirky idea for an article: knock on doors of fabulous houses in the nation's wealthiest ZIP Codes and interview the owners for tips about how to become "rich like them."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, just in time for the bust, he has expanded his light, anecdotal magazine feature into a 247-page claim on our attention. Though the grim machinery of wealth destruction is plowing through even the toniest neighborhoods, there is no hint here that becoming rich and staying that way just isn't as easy as it used to be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not until page 160 does Mr. D'Agostino happen to mention that all is not well in the economy, noting that his conversations took place "well before the subprime mortgage crisis." Thus his interlocutors chatter away about the secrets of their success, oblivious to the impending plunge in the stock market and home prices, the decimation of retirement portfolios, and the spike in unemployment -- not to mention the Bernie Madoff scandal, which has left many people to sit in fabulous homes wondering where their money went.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Timing aside, there are still plenty of wealthy people in America who have interesting stories to share, but "Rich Like Them" leaves the reader wondering why Mr. D'Agostino didn't do a better job of finding them. Every reporter knows the value of shoe leather and talking your way in to see a source, but to get the story you also have to identify your subjects ahead of time, do your homework, set up interviews and make efficient use of your reporting time. Instead, Mr. D'Agostino sticks with his strategy: wandering the streets of affluent towns from Palm Beach, Fla., to Atherton, Calif., randomly knocking on doors to ask people how they came to live in such a great place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A good part of the book is spent describing his failures to get interviews and his travails with scary guard dogs, closed gates and hostile homeowners. At times Mr. D'Agostino seems like a forlorn Fuller Brush salesman, lamenting his blisters and aching feet. In Seattle, he reports, it took visits to more than 60 houses to land three decent conversations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It doesn't seem to register with him that people don't answer the doors to strangers for good reason. In the flats of Beverly Hills, where he encounters the highest concentration of homes where the owner was in but declined to be interviewed, he finds "snotty" housewives who "waved their bony hands dismissively in my face, mumbled something condescending, and slammed the door." To use the author's parlance: Dude, this is Los Angeles. Have you ever heard of Charles Manson?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. D'Agostino does manage to talk his way into a number of homes around the country, sometimes with the help of a friend or a local he gets to know at a bar or restaurant. The folks he meets aren't exactly Bill Gates or Warren Buffett, but they do live in nice places; the author swoons over a 7,300-square-foot house done in the "Texas-Tuscan style -- grand without being showy," where he finds nirvana in the kitchen: three dishwashers, two Sub-Zero refrigerators and a Wolf range. The house's owner, a health-care services entrepreneur, has a worthwhile story to relate: He noticed how frustrated doctors were by hospital bureaucracy and how they longed to work out of smaller centers where they could deal with more patients and less red tape. So he went into the business of helping doctors set up specialized-care facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the others who opened their doors to Mr. D'Agostino also offer fascinating glimpses of how they got where they are. A former actor started a bookstore specializing in first editions, including books made into films. The owner of a travel business in Westport, Conn., had a brainstorm when he discovered in the 1970s that the helicopters and mountain lodges employed for winter skiing sit idle the rest of the year: He decided to use them for luxury getaways he called "heli-hiking." A successful Silicon Valley venture capitalist flourished by taking the opposite tack of many of her VC colleagues: She didn't lord her power over the techie dreamers who came looking for money; she took a low-key approach and remembered the "many times in my life when I got a door slammed in my face."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the details regarding all this wealth accumulation are thin, and the advice on offer isn't exactly new or earth-shattering. The tips run along the lines of "always be looking for opportunity," "calculate risk," "do one thing and do it well" and "have a growth-mind-set."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. D'Agostino hails the virtue of being young and clueless about the future and putting this piece of advice in your wallet: Work hard, "because you haven't yet figured out how much you can slack off and get away with, so you don't slack off at all . . . your brain learns that hard works equals prizes . . . and thus begins a lifelong cycle of never slacking off and periodically socking away untold piles of cash into your bank account." If only it always worked out that way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for slacking off, by the end of the book Mr. D'Agostino himself starts to flag. When he can't get in to see one house, he settles for talking to the owner on the phone and for the assurances of a friend that the unseen dwelling is "amazing." In a last bold attempt at ogling the interiors of another really rich person's house, he drives by the home of the now- deceased Brooke Astor in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., a year after her much-publicized travails over her son's grab for her fortune. Mr. D'Agostino is turned away by the security guard and later wonders what he might have learned from Mrs. Astor. For starters, the gracious Mrs. Astor might have gently instructed him on a basic point of etiquette: One simply doesn't show up unannounced and uninvited.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes listed for sale declined in many metropolitan areas last month, but the drop was smaller than has been typical for the holiday period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of homes available for sale in 29 major metropolitan areas in December was down 6.4% from a month earlier, according to figures compiled by ZipRealty Inc., a real-estate brokerage firm based in Emeryville, Calif. The ZipRealty data cover all single-family homes, condominiums and town houses listed on local multiple-listing services in metro areas where the firm operates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a national basis, inventories typically fall sharply in December from November because fewer people want to show their homes during the holidays. Over the past 25 years, the average decrease in December from the prior month has been 11%, according to Zelman &amp;Associates, a research firm. Compared with a year earlier, the December inventory in the 29 metro areas was down about 9.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, about 4.2 million previously occupied homes were listed for sale at the end of November, according to the National Association of Realtors. That is enough to last about 11 months at the current sales rate. The housing market is considered roughly in balance between supply and demand when the inventory is around six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These inventory numbers don't capture the entire housing supply. Newly constructed housing and foreclosed homes, a large part of the supply, aren't always included in Realtors' multiple-listing services. In addition, many people have taken their houses off the market, hoping to get a better price later. Those homes will come back on the market eventually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ZipRealty data don't cover New York City. Miller Samuel Inc., an appraisal firm there, says there were 9,081 cooperative apartments and condominiums on the market in Manhattan at the end of December. That was down 2.9% from November but up 41% from December 2007.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal bankruptcy judges say they are eager to have the power to restructure mortgages for struggling debtors because it could save hundreds of thousands of homeowners from foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Top Senate Democrats are advancing legislation to let bankruptcy-court judges approve new repayment terms on first mortgages for primary residences for homeowners who have sought protection in a Chapter 13 filing. The proposal allowing so-called mortgage cramdowns, in which the principal amount of the loan is reduced, is one of several efforts Democrats are pushing to give homeowners relief as they wrestle with increasing debt levels and plummeting home values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Judges overseeing bankruptcy cases already can approve modifications for credit-card debt and most other kinds of loans, including second-home mortgages. But they haven't been able to modify primary-home mortgages since 1979, when the U.S. bankruptcy code went into effect, said Samuel L. Bufford, a U.S. bankruptcy judge in Los Angeles. Before then, many states allowed judges to do some form of modification, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allowing a judge to modify loans gets around the problem that many mortgages have been turned into securities and sold to multiple investors. "The bankruptcy system depends on people making deals, but the deal-making piece of it has disappeared when it comes to mortgages because of the way mortgages were sold and packaged," Judge Bufford said. "There's nobody on the lender side to do the deal unless you [get permission] from investors, and that's impossible."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The measure is "a good idea," said Laurel Isicoff, a federal bankruptcy judge in Miami. Financial institutions have gotten help from the government, but the only way to fix the economy is through "a holistic approach" that also "solves the problem of people losing their homes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until last week, when <span class="companylink">Citigroup Inc</span>., one of the nation's largest mortgage lenders, dropped its opposition, the banking industry had long fought modification of first mortgages in bankruptcy, fearing it would encourage more homeowners to file for Chapter 13 and that it would further destabilize the housing market. Representatives of the Mortgage Bankers Association said last week that they were still opposed to cramdowns. But <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>'s support increases the chances of passing legislation that would allow judges to lower the interest rate, reduce the principal or alter the length of primary mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opponents of the proposed law change, including the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, say it would have "serious and negative consequences," including increasing mortgage rates for consumers overall because investors who typically buy the loans might deem new mortgage contracts too risky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Chapter 13 filing is a plan in which debtors can retain assets and pay back their debt over three to five years. About two-thirds of Chapter 13 filers have a mortgage, but half of them aren't able to keep paying the mortgage as part of their reorganization, judges and lawyers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Jay Cristol, a federal bankruptcy judge in Miami, said that changing the bankruptcy law would be beneficial because "after foreclosure, families get broken up and lenders hold on to nonperforming assets that they sell at a loss."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Samuel Schwartz, a Las Vegas bankruptcy lawyer, has a client who is facing foreclosure on her primary residence even though she has been able to modify the loans on her two investment houses. Under the current bankruptcy rules, she was able to "strip away" the second mortgage on one of the investment homes and she "crammed down," or reduced, the principal balances on the first mortgages for both rentals -- reducing her combined loan balances to a total of $355,000 from $590,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She was also able to strip away the second mortgage on her primary residence but couldn't modify the first mortgage. That mortgage, Mr. Schwartz said, is more than $100,000 above the current value of the property. Thus, she still may lose her own home. Under the new law, her first mortgage on her home also could be modified.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nancy Keates </div><div>1548 words</div><div>12 January 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Real Estate; A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(See Correction &amp;Amplification below [cx].)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FAIRFAX STATION, VA. -- On a recent weekday, David Lereah sat in the sunroom of his five-bedroom colonial house. The only sound was the yapping of his dog Maisy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once one of the world's most-visible housing experts, Mr. Lereah is disconnected from his old life. The former chief economist for the National Association of Realtors says the group's top executives won't return his phone calls. He says he wasn't invited to the association's 100th birthday bash last May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lereah, 55 years old, is one of many prognosticators who won professional accolades during the housing boom, only to see their reputations wither in the bust. Throughout 2005, when home prices in the U.S. hit their fifth consecutive annual record, Mr. Lereah was on television so often his wife, Wendy, would catch him by accident. He flew first-class to meetings and speeches in places like Hawaii and Aspen, Colo., staying in suites at expensive resorts. His bosses awarded him more responsibility. That year, he published his second book, "Are You Missing the Real Estate Boom?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lereah continued to make rosy statements amid growing signs of a housing downturn -- like this declaration in January 2007: "It appears we have established a bottom." A few months later, NAR announced that existing-home sales fell 2.6% in April from a month earlier and 10.7% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some critics pummeled Mr. Lereah for his optimism. Bloggers nicknamed him "Baghdad Dave," after the Iraqi information minister Mohammed al-Sahaf, called "Baghdad Bob," known for his pro-Iraq press briefings at the time of the U.S. invasion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lereah, who says he left NAR voluntarily, says he was pressured by executives to issue optimistic forecasts -- then was left to shoulder the blame when things went sour. "I was there for seven years doing everything they wanted me to," he said, looking out his window to his tree-filled yard in this Washington suburb. Mr. Lereah now works at home, trying to rebuild his career and saddled with a sagging portfolio of real-estate investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for NAR says Mr. Lereah used the same kind of forecasts in his book, which wasn't an NAR publication.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAR, which represents half the 2.6 million licensed real-estate agents in the country, has its critics. One concern is that while the organization collects and releases objective data about home sales, it also provides commentary on those statistics -- and has a mission to advance its members.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Roberts, author of "The Great Housing Bubble," says the Securities and Exchange Commission should regulate NAR the way it regulates financial advisers. "Realtors are currently able to make any statement they wish regarding the investment potential of real estate, no matter how ridiculous," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Realtors are the most trusted resource for real estate information," says the NAR spokesman in an email, adding that the group "has gathered the most comprehensive data on real estate in the world." The spokesman says that during his tenure Mr. Lereah was "solely responsible for the content of NAR forecasts and housing reports -- both the data and the interpretation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the who's who of experts and policy wonks now accused of irrational sunniness are former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and Robert Toll, chairman and CEO of <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span>. But Mr. Lereah has gotten more than his share of the finger-pointing in part because he was such a public face during the housing boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Raised in the suburb of Long Beach, N.Y., Mr. Lereah says he decided he wanted to be an economist in high school. His first job was as an economics professor at Rutgers, then at the University of Virginia, and later as a regulator and economist at the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lereah says he was recruited to NAR in 2000 with an offer in the "healthy six figures." During the boom years, Mr. Lereah was eager to profit himself. He snapped up condos, including two in Washington in 2003 and 2004 and one each in Tampa, Richmond, Va., Alexandria, Va., and Naples, Fla. By 2006, he says, he owned six condos worth between $150,000 and $400,000 apiece.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late 2005, the market began to fall, and in the third quarter of 2006 existing-home sales sank 12.7% from a year earlier. Mr. Lereah remained publicly upbeat, saying the market is "likely to pick up a bit" and arguing it was experiencing a "soft landing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon, mainstream economists and the press were calling him out. "I thought it was criminal that he kept saying we'd reached bottom," says Ivy Zelman, former housing-market analyst at <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> and now head of her own housing-sector research firm. She says she dubbed Mr. Lereah "Mr. Liar-eah."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lereah says he was starting to worry about the housing market and tried to tone down his optimistic comments with phrases like "we also may be seeing some fallout from a decline in subprime lending." He says his critics nevertheless "became vicious."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lereah admits to one mistake: believing there would be no national housing crash. "I have to take the blame for that," he says. "I never thought it would be as bad as this."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April 2007, Mr. Lereah left NAR, and after working about a year on a start-up venture, took some time off for a few months. He cruised around on his 29-foot sport-fishing boat and played golf at the country club. He eventually started consulting on the real-estate market again, this time to hedge funds and Japanese companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lereah now works in a small upstairs office that doubles as an exercise room. He has started his own company, Reecon Advisors, that puts out a weekly newsletter on the housing market and provides consulting services. "I feel I have such a refreshing view now because I'm not representing any interests," says Mr. Lereah.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He charges $495 annually for the newsletter, and currently has fewer than 50 paying subscribers -- a number Mr. Lereah aims to increase to 1,500 by the end of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He's starting to make some money off it now, not much," says Mrs. Lereah. "We have an expensive lifestyle: a big house, a housekeeper once a week, college tuitions, the country club."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Lereah, a CPA who also works at home, decided the only way she and her husband could work in the same house was if they pretended they were at outside offices. They communicate during the day by email and cellphone. Every morning, Mr. Lereah drives to a Dunkin' Donuts or <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> and eats in the car, just as he would have on his commute to NAR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lereah's real-estate portfolio has taken a hit. He says his 3,068-square-foot five-bedroom, 5½-bathroom brick house has lost about 20% of its value in the past two years. (It is worth $780,000 now, according to Zillow.com.) His condos are down, too. He now says housing prices won't recover for some time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His successor at NAR, Lawrence Yun, however, says things might be looking up. In his latest news release, Mr. Yun says that although the pending home-sales index based on contracts signed in November fell 5.3 from a year earlier, with a "proper real-estate focused stimulus measure," home sales could rise more than expected, by more than 10%, to 5.5 million, in 2009.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction &amp;Amplification</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Lereah, former chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, says that because the NAR represented the interests of Realtors, he was pressured to say positive things about the association's data releases, but that he pushed back in some instances. "My forecasts were always credible and came out of our housing forecasting model," he says, adding that he sometimes asked the public-relations department to tone down the quotes about the housing data releases they had written for him. Mr. Lereah says he left his NAR position in April 2007 when <span class="companylink">Move Inc</span>., which has an operating agreement with NAR, offered him more money and a great opportunity to manage a new venture for the company. Mr. Lereah left the company in 2008 when Move canceled the venture. Mr. Lereah says that with the exception of one of the five real-estate investments he has made, if he sold his real-estate portfolio today, including his home, he would earn a sizable gain on his investments. This article on Mr. Lereah incorrectly paraphrased him as saying that he was pressured by NAR to issue optimistic forecasts and incorrectly characterized the performance of his real-estate portfolio. It also said that he left NAR voluntarily but failed to explain that he was hired by <span class="companylink">Move Inc</span>. In addition, Mr. Lereah first worked at the University of Virginia and then Rutgers; the article incorrectly said that he first worked at Rutgers.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Christina S.N. Lewis </div><div>823 words</div><div>9 January 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Real Estate; W8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alex Rodriguez has cut the asking price of his Coral Gables, Fla., home to $12.3 million -- just above the $12 million he and his estranged wife, Cynthia, paid for it in 2004. The Yankees slugger first listed the house in the fall for $14.9 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 8,300-square-foot house, on more than an acre on Biscayne Bay, has a dock and views of downtown Miami. Art-world philanthropist Ella Fontanals-Cisneros sold the 1952 house to the Rodriguez family, and they spent a significant amount of money on renovations, says listing agent Polly Schiff of Coldwell Banker. For example, Mr. Rodriguez turned the tennis court into a well-camouflaged batting cage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Mr. Rodriguez's wife filed for divorce. The 33-year-old Yankee is also trying to sell a Manhattan apartment for $10 million, $4 million less than what he had originally been asking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The downturn hasn't spared Coral Gables. In the fourth quarter, only two homes in the city just south of Miami sold for more than $5 million, according to local broker Audrey Ross, of <span class="companylink">Esslinger-Wooten-Maxwell</span>, an affiliate of Christie's Great Estates. There are 43 such homes on the market, based on multiple-listing-service information, Ms. Ross says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don King Offers Estate For $27.5 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 70 miles farther north -- in Manalapan, about 10 miles south of Palm Beach -- boxing's Don King listed his oceanfront estate Thursday for $27.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I need to downsize," said Mr. King, who is now 77 and said walking from house to house has become inconvenient. "I'm going to move to wherever I can find a nice little cozy, $10-to-$5-million house."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Made up of two adjacent properties, the gated, nearly three-acre compound has been the site of many parties hosted by the colorful fight promoter. As part of the property, the Mediterranean-style main house has seven bedrooms, nine bathrooms and a three-car garage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Visitors enter an open-air courtyard with a bridge over a goldfish pond. The guest house, which Mr. King used for large parties, has four bedrooms, nine bathrooms, a large living room and an ice-cream parlor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both houses have pools. The beach, roughly 15 feet down, is accessed via a retractable staircase. Mr. King and his wife, Henrietta, paid a total of $14.3 million for the two properties in 1999. Pascal Liguori, of Premier Estate Properties, has the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. King, who promoted fights for Muhammad Ali and Mike Tyson, said he believes an overseas buyer is likely to acquire the house, given the grim economy. He added that he has no debt and isn't in financial straits. "I started at sub-zero," he said. "Anything I get is going to be better than where I was."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The promoter also owns an 80-acre ranch training camp in his native Cleveland, a second training camp about 65 miles north of Palm Beach in Fort Pierce, Fla., and two homes in Las Vegas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monster.com Founder's NYC Apartment Listed</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The estate of Andrew McKelvey, who founded Internet job-search pioneer Monster.com, has listed his massive New York City midtown apartment for $7.9 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment, assembled from three units in the 1990s, includes a bedroom converted into a virtual golf driving range with artificial-turf flooring, a large video screen and a net. The 6,000-square-foot co-operative apartment on 58th Street occupies the entire 41st floor of The Sovereign, a 1971 building, and has nearly 360-degree views, says Lauren Cangiano, of Halstead Properties, who shares the listing with her colleague Peter Kapp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McKelvey, who spent decades in the yellow-pages ad field, died in November at age 74. Last year, he admitted backdating employee stock options but avoided prison. Four children survive him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Night and Day -- For $140,000 a Month</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cole Porter's former apartment at New York's Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, is available for rent -- at $140,000 a month, one of Manhattan's highest prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Waldorf Towers, the hotel's residential section, the six-bedroom was home to the composer-lyricist from 1934 to 1964. Later, Frank Sinatra paid $1 million a year for the suite, according to "The Waldorf-Astoria" by Ward Morehouse III. A rental tenant who had lived there for 10 years passed away last year, according to rental agent Margaret Bay, of Brown Harris Stevens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Porter, who gave such standards as "Delovely." "Night and Day" and "Anything Goes" to Broadway and Hollywood, mentions the Waldorf's signature salad in one of his lyrics for "You're the Top." His Steinway grand piano still stands in the hotel lobby.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Lingling Wei </div><div>1009 words</div><div>8 January 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Commercial Real Estate; C1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Delinquencies on mortgages for hotels, shopping malls and office buildings were sharply higher in the fourth quarter, as the weaker economy hit landlords and threatens to cause losses for investors in the $3.4 trillion market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial real estate has held up better than the housing market, but began to struggle at the end of last year. New data from <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> show that delinquencies on commercial mortgages packaged and sold as bonds, which represent nearly a third of the commercial real-estate debt market, nearly doubled during the past three months, to about 1.2%. The figure includes mortgages that are 30 days or more past due and in foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The delinquency rate will likely hit 3% by the end of 2009, its highest point in more than a decade, says Richard Parkus <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>'s head of research on such bonds, known as commercial-mortgage-backed securities, or CMBS. "Throughout this year, we're going to continue to see a significant acceleration of problem loans," he says. "CMBS prices already have priced in a far greater delinquency rate on the underlying loans."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Delinquencies on commercial-real-estate loans held by banks and thrifts, which are big holders of this debt, also have risen strongly and many firms have suffered losses. According to research firm Foresight Analytics, soured commercial mortgages on banks' books jumped to 2.2% as of the third quarter of last year, from 1.5% at the end of 2007. The research firm estimates that the rate could rise to 2.6% in the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices of securities tied to commercial mortgages have fallen sharply in recent months to the point that prices reflect a downturn even greater than the early 1990s, when default rates exceeded 30%. The $3.4 trillion of commercial mortgages in circulation is small compared with the $11.2 trillion of residential-mortgage debt outstanding, but it is still more than numerous other debt categories. Consumer credit, for instance, totals about $2.6 trillion. To be sure, commercial-mortgage delinquencies are much lower than subprime residential mortgages, the culprit for the current economic and financial crisis. About 30% of those loans to credit-impaired homeowners are at least 90 days past due.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently, investors thought commercial real estate would hold up through the downturn. There was less speculative development than during previous boom cycles, and underwriting standards on commercial mortgages appeared to be better than those for residential mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But evidence is emerging that the commercial-property market -- which runs from apartment and office buildings to shopping malls and warehouses -- had some of the same excesses as the housing segment. An unusually high number of the underlying CMBS loans that are going bad were made and securitized in the past three years. That is a sign that investors overpaid greatly for those properties and that underwriting standards were loose. In many cases banks lent money based on future income assumptions rather than current cash flows, experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, one of the delinquent CMBS loans is a $125 million mortgage secured by a shopping center in Corona, Calif. called Promenade Shops. The property's annual cash flow was $6.3 million when <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> underwrote the loan in July 2007. But the loan was based on the assumption that the cash flow would rise to about $10.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Delinquency rates among the most recent vintages are already surging ahead of those of older vintages. This speaks to the weakening in underwriting quality that occurred in recent years," Mr. Parkus says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial-mortgage experts say this doesn't bode well for the thousands of loans that also were made with optimistic assumptions. For example, investors are closely watching CMBS issues that were used to finance the $5.4 billion acquisition of a sprawling Manhattan apartment complex in 2006 by a venture led by developer Tishman Speyer Properties and BlackRock Realty Advisors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moody's Investors Service recently downgraded some classes of those bonds. If there is a debt-service shortfall, the investors in the property would have to put up more cash or face the possibility of foreclosure. Tishman, which declined to comment, has said the partners are confident in the investment and would put more capital into the project if needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the top 15 CMBS originators, loans made by Column Financial, a unit of <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse Group</span>, currently have the highest 60-day-or-more delinquency rate, at 1.71%, according to Trepp, a New York company that tracks the market for commercial-real-estate financing. No. 2, at 1.63%, is LaSalle Bank, which is now owned by <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks and thrifts would suffer in a commercial-real-estate downturn because they own nearly 50% of all commercial mortgages outstanding. Many of these institutions are particularly vulnerable. According to Foresight Analytics, as of Sept. 30, 2008, some 1,400 commercial banks and savings institutions had more than 300% of their Tier 1 capital in commercial mortgages. Tier 1 capital is a key indicator of a bank's ability to absorb losses. Regulators consider anything over 300% to be excessive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Mutual Bank Corp. in Harvey, Ill., for instance, the amount of commercial mortgages outstanding represented 752% of its Tier 1 Capital as of the third quarter of last year, according to Foresight Analytics. And delinquencies reached 11.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've struggled the same as other banks with commercial real estate," says Thomas Pacocha, chief credit officer at the bank, which had $1.7 billion in total assets as of the end of September. "The economy caused the situation to a great extent. When the economy rectifies itself, the bank will see a great improvement in its balance sheet."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pacocha adds that since the third quarter, the bank has "made some progress in reducing dependence on commercial real estate."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos </div><div>1036 words</div><div>7 January 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Real Estate; C10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing downturn started out as a boon to apartment landlords as troubled homeowners became renters again. But as the recession deepens, the good times for landlords are ending and many are offering concessions and discounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Figures to be released Wednesday by New York-based research firm <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>. show that effective rents, which includes free rent and other landlord concessions, fell by 0.4% in the fourth quarter of 2008, the first time that rents have fallen since early 2003. For 2008, rents increased by just 2.2%, down from 4.6% last year, and the nation's apartment-vacancy rate rose nearly one percentage point to 6.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's now clear that apartments are going to take a much bigger hit than what most people initially expected," says Hessam Nadji, a managing director at commercial real-estate brokerage Marcus &amp;Millichap, which is set to release a separate report Wednesday projecting no growth in apartment rent for 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even cities that posted healthy rent increases in early 2008, including San Francisco, Seattle and New York, are no longer immune from the chill as job losses in the professional-services sector reduce demand for apartments. In periods of rising unemployment, would-be renters double up in apartments or move in with friends and families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue growth is "going to be materially worse than it has been" over the next two years, says Andrew McCulloch of real-estate consultancy Green Street Advisors Inc. Rents stayed flat or declined in 59 of the 79 markets tracked by Reis last quarter, and vacancies decreased in just 10 markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Girding for Tough Times</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, publicly traded real-estate investment firms are battening down the hatches. <span class="companylink">AvalonBay Communities Inc</span>., an Alexandria, Va.-based REIT, said last month that it would halt all new construction in the first half of 2009, incurring a noncash charge of $55 million to $65 million for eight land parcels that won't be developed. Also last month, Atlanta-based <span class="companylink">Post Properties Inc</span>. cut its quarterly dividend to 20 cents, from 45 cents, to save about $43 million annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While New York City's vacancy rate, at 2.3%, remained the best in the nation, rent growth fell by 1.9% in the fourth quarter from the third quarter, the worst decline in the country. Rents gained just 0.6% for the year in New York, a sharp reversal from just two years ago, when rents posted 8% annual increases. Heavy job losses are likely to curb Manhattan's appetite for luxury housing that spurred the construction of gleaming new apartment towers in all corners of the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As financial-services firms shed jobs, owners also are relaxing upfront fees and offering one or two months of free rent. In December, Archstone Apartments, a privately held owner of 70,000 units, offered one month free rent on one- and two-bedroom apartments in Manhattan priced between $3,000 and $5,500 at several properties, while others waived security deposits for qualified tenants or gave away $3,000 Visa gift cards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Owners are concerned. They have more vacancies than they care to admit ... and will do anything it takes to fill them," says Daniel Baum, chief operating officer of the Real Estate Group of New York, an apartment broker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New luxury rentals in New York's financial district have been particularly hard hit. Jake Dardashtian moved into a one-bedroom apartment at 10 Hanover Square, a luxury high-rise, with a roommate in November after being offered one month's free rent and a free gym membership valued at $75 monthly. The building also paid his broker's fee, which was equal to the $3,500 monthly rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 22-year-old money manager, who moved in with his parents after graduating from college last year, says that without the concessions, "I definitely would have lived at home for a couple more months to save money."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other owners are simply reducing rents. At Post Properties' Post Forest community in Fairfax, Va., two-bedroom units are renting for $1,350 per month, down from $1,480 last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other storm clouds loom for apartments. The industry continues to be battered by a "shadow market" of condos and single-family homes being rented at big discounts by homeowners and investors unable to sell. That excess inventory, estimated at around 1.2 million housing units, showed no signs of easing during the first nine months of 2008, even as housing construction declined sharply, said Ron Witten, a Dallas-based housing analyst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some of the hardest-hit markets, falling home prices also could lure potential apartment tenants with good credit and savings. In Fort Lauderdale, Fla., for example, rents during the third quarter averaged $1,125, according to CBRE Torto Wheaton. With 20% down on a $134,000 home -- the median price for the region -- monthly mortgage payments before taxes average just $820.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Positioned for Future</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Longer term, however, some analysts believe that apartment companies will likely benefit from the limited amount of new apartment construction that took place over the past five years. For example, the number of new apartments completed last year -- less than 100,000 units nationwide -- is about half the number that was completed in 2000 and the lowest in 15 years. The constrained supply, coupled with favorable demographics, won't blunt the current downturn, but it should boost the industry when the economy recovers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The financing options also are more favorable for apartment companies than most other sectors in commercial real estate, where owners are struggling to refinance debt. That is because the industry is buoyed by government-led <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, which provide liquidity to the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fannie and Freddie provided 80% of new multifamily financing in the 12-month period ending in August, nearly double the 40% financing that the firms provided in the previous year period, according to analysis of Federal Reserve data by Gleb Nechayev, senior economist at CBRE Torto Wheaton Research.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. is already a year deep in the current recession, but there are fresh signs of more weakness ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A gauge of future home sales sank in November, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday, while separate reports showed declines in both manufacturing and service-sector activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending home sales, based on signed contracts that typically lead actual closings by a month or two, slumped in November after holding steady for much of 2008. The Realtors group said rising unemployment and low consumer confidence deterred buyers, and its index fell 4% to a level of 82.3, the lowest since the series began in 2001.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In other words, there is no evidence yet of any kind of rebound in housing," said Michael Darda, chief economist at MKM Partners in Stamford, Conn., in a note to clients. He added that while mortgage rates, currently at half-century lows, are helping to stimulate refinance activity, it isn't clear whether they are doing much to boost sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors group is asking Congress to pass several measures to help the industry, such as a $7,500 tax credit to all home buyers and a permanent increase on loan limits to help make mortgages more affordable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, woes in manufacturing -- a sector that, like housing, has been struggling for several years -- also worsened in recent months. New orders for manufactured goods, a key sign of health in the industry and in the U.S. economy in general, fell by 4.6% in November to $385 billion, the Commerce Department reported, following a downwardly revised 6% drop in October from the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for durable goods -- items such as furniture and appliances designed to last three years or more -- fell by 1.5% in November to $186 billion, a larger drop than previously reported. Shipments of goods fell by 5.3%, the largest monthly drop since the series began in 1992, to $394 billion. Falling demand for goods also pushed up inventory levels, which could lead to future drops in new orders or price reductions aimed at boosting sales. A key gauge of business spending, nondefense capital-goods orders excluding aircraft, rose 3.9% after a large decline in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Activity in the service sector, which includes restaurant, hotel and retail jobs, and forms a larger share of U.S. jobs and production than manufacturing, continued to contract in December, the Institute for Supply Management reported, though at a slower pace than the month before. The ISM gauge of nonmanufacturing activity rose to 40.6 from 37.3 in November -- levels below 50 indicate contraction -- with new orders, production, employment and exports showing some improvement from low levels of activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I still don't anticipate growth in this sector during the first half of the year," said Anthony Nieves, a <span class="companylink">Hilton Hotels Corp</span>. executive and survey chairman.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York's borough of Manhattan, among the U.S.'s most expensive housing markets, has been largely immune from the national housing downturn. But that's about to change as the area braces for significant price declines in 2009, according to two industry reports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, prices of condominiums and cooperative apartments -- the dominant type of housing in Manhattan -- that sold in the fourth quarter were higher than a year earlier, averaging $1.49 million. That was up 3.1% from the fourth quarter of 2007, according to Prudential Douglas Elliman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the average prices of units that are under contract but haven't yet closed declined 20% since August 2008, a rapid reversal, according to Miller Samuel Real Estate Appraisers, which co-wrote one report with Prudential Douglas Elliman, one of the city's largest residential real-estate firms. Those sales should close during the first quarter of 2009. A separate report by <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span> found that transactions in the fourth quarter fell by as much as 53%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Manhattan market . . . has clearly entered a new period of lower sales activity and overall declines in prices," said Jonathan J. Miller, chief executive of Miller Samuel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One sure sign of steeper price cuts to come: The inventory of homes for sale was up 39% in the fourth quarter from the same quarter a year ago.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jeff Bater </div><div>1162 words</div><div>6 January 2009</div><div>11:07</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Economy</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Factory orders plunged in November, dropping more than expected as prices kept falling for oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, service-sector activity in the U.S. contracted in December, albeit less dramatically than expected, and a separate forecasting gauge of housing market activity fell more than expected in November amid a weakened job market and ailing economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for manufactured goods decreased 4.6%, following a downwardly revised 6.0% decrease in October, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. Originally, factory orders were seen falling 5.1% in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists had forecast November factory goods orders slipping by 2.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for durable goods fell a revised 1.5% in November. Durables are expensive goods made to last at least three years. Two weeks ago, Commerce had estimated durables in November sliding 1.0%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Non-durable goods factory orders decreased 7.4%, after falling by 3.8% in October and 5.8% in September. Petroleum is a non-durable, and the huge drop in oil prices since July's peak likely was behind the repeated declines in orders. Lower prices, in turn, lower the value of orders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft increased 3.9%, after falling by 6.7% in October. Those bookings are seen as a yardstick for capital spending by businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decrease in overall November factory orders was the fourth straight drop. Unfilled orders, a sign of future demand, were 0.6% lower in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another report on the factory sector released this month, the Institute for Supply Management's index of manufacturing activity for December, was grim. The index toppled to 32.4 from 36.2 in November. The reading was the softest since June 1980.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for factory goods made in the transportation sector decreased 7.6%, after falling 12.8% in October. Non-military aircraft and parts orders plunged 37.7%, after falling by 8.7% in October. Defense aircraft and parts orders decreased 10.9%, after falling by 8.3% in October. Ships and boats increased 26.3%, after falling by 64.5% in October. Orders for motor vehicle bodies and parts decreased 0.1%, after falling by 4.1% in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Excluding transportation orders, overall factory orders decreased 4.2%, after falling by 5.1% in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Capital goods orders decreased 0.5%, after falling by 10.9% in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Defense capital-goods orders increased 7.8%, after falling 35.4% in October. Without defense orders, overall factory orders decreased 4.7%, after falling by 5.2% in October. Defense capital goods industries include, among others, communications equipment, aircraft and missiles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for all non-defense capital goods -- business equipment meant to last 10 years or more -- decreased 1.5%, after falling by 6.5% in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer-goods orders decreased 6.5%, with consumer durable goods orders falling 1.3% and consumer non-durables down 7.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders decreased in November by 2.7% for primary metals and 1.8% for electrical equipment. Orders rose 6.0% for computers and electronic products. 0.3% for fabricated metals, and 2.4% for machinery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report showed November factory shipments decreased 5.3%. Inventories fell 0.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report from the Institute for Supply Management on Tuesday put the private research group's overall index of non-manufacturing activity at 40.6, from 37.3 in November and 44.4 in October. That compared with the 36.8 that was the forecast of economists surveyed by Dow Jones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Readings under 50 indicate contracting activity. In its report, the ISM also said that its non-manufacturing business activity/production index stood at 39.6 in December, from 33.0 the month before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Respondents' comments reflect concern about the overall decline in business, lack of funding, budget cuts and lower employment," said Anthony Nieves, who directs the survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much as was seen in the ISM's manufacturing report, there was little good news to be found in the performance of the service sector in the final month of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employment contracted at a slower pace, with that index at 34.7, from 31.3, while new orders also pulled back more slowly, with that reading coming in at 39.9, from 35.4.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inflation pressures continued to wilt, with the prices index standing at 36.0, from 36.6. The December prices reading was the lowest since the survey began in 1997.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending Home Sales Decline</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors' index for pending sales of previously owned homes fell 4.0% in November to 82.3 from a revised reading of 85.7 in October, the industry group said Tuesday. The key index is used to help predict future home-sales activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private analysts projected pending sales would fall just 1.0% during November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gauge had dipped 4.2% in October; initially, NAR reported a decline of just 0.7% for October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Mounting job losses and very weak consumer confidence deterred home buyers from signing contracts in November," said Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist. "December's housing market activity could be comparably lower due to ongoing problems in the economy, so a real estate-focused stimulus plan is urgently needed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its monthly forecast on the industry, the NAR projected existing-home sales at 4.90 million in 2008 and 5.22 million in 2009. That compares to 5.65 million in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price is seen at $197,000 in 2008 and $198,100 in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A month ago, the NAR forecast 2008 sales at 4.96 million and 5.19 million in 2009. That compares to 5.65 million in 2007. The median price for an existing home was seen at $198.500 in 2008 and $199,200 in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actual sales of existing homes in November fell 8.6% to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 4.49 million units in November, the NAR reported late last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR's pending home sales index was designed to try measuring which way the housing market is going in the future. It is based on pending sales of existing homes, including single-family homes and condominiums. A home sale is pending when the contract has been signed but the transaction hasn't closed. Pending sales typically close within one or two months of signing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By region, pending sales in the Northeast dropped 7.2% in November from October; they were down 14.6% since November 2007. Midwest activity fell 6.7% in November from October; it's fallen 10.1% since November 2007. Activity in the South fell 2.2% in November compared to October; it has fallen 12.7% since November 2007. In the West pending sales fell 2.4% in November from October; they're up 19.3% since November 2007.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan, among the nation's most expensive housing markets, has been largely immune from the national housing downturn. But that's about to change as the area braces for significant price declines in 2009, according to two industry reports scheduled to be released Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, prices of condominiums and cooperative apartments -- the dominant type of housing in Manhattan -- that sold in the fourth quarter of 2008 were higher than a year earlier, averaging $1.49 million. That was up 3.1% from the fourth quarter of 2007, according to Prudential Douglas Elliman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the average prices of units that are under contract but haven't yet closed declined 20% since August 2008, a rapid reversal, according to Miller Samuel Real Estate Appraisers, which co-wrote one report with Prudential Douglas Elliman, one of the city's largest residential real-estate firms. Those sales should close during the first quarter of 2009. A separate report by <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span> found that transactions in the fourth quarter fell by as much as 53%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Manhattan market ... has clearly entered a new period of lower sales activity and overall declines in prices," said Jonathan J. Miller, chief executive of Miller Samuel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One sure sign of steeper price cuts to come: The inventory of homes for sale was up 39% in the fourth quarter from the same quarter a year ago. Real-estate brokers said the Manhattan market slowed sharply in mid-September, when credit markets seized up and <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> filed for bankruptcy. Since then, inventory has soared as buyers have become more selective and more willing to wait for a good deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While none of Manhattan's neighborhoods appear immune from the coming downturn, emerging districts will be particularly hard hit. In Harlem, a historically African-American community that experienced the biggest building boom in several decades, prices remained flat, but sales in the third quarter plunged 76% compared with the third quarter of 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate brokers say the decline in Harlem sales activity partly reflects the difficulty some potential buyers are having obtaining mortgages. At the same time, some buyers once attracted to Harlem can now afford to buy in more-established communities. "If you have $1 million to spend, Harlem is much less attractive to you," said Matthew Haines, a Harlem resident and founder of PropertyShark.com, which collaborated on the Corcoran report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, significantly smaller Wall Street bonuses, which are projected to fall by as much as 50% from last year, could exacerbate the coming downturn, particularly in high-end sales that had been immune to the credit crunch for most of the past year. "Without those Wall Street bonuses chasing real estate, the psychology of the market is different," said Pamela Liebman, chief executive of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>. "There's no urgency for buyers."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worries about the global economy kept stocks in the doldrums, despite talk of new policy moves to bolster the financial system and a promising report on construction spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At midday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 66.74 points, or 0.7%, at 8967.95. The blue-chip measure posted a triple-digit decline in early trading but recovered somewhat following the release of a Commerce Department report that U.S. construction spending fell about 0.6% in November, a smaller drop than expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span> 500-stock index was down 3.19, or 0.3% at 928.61, led lower by consumer-discretionary stocks, though energy and utilities categories were bright spots. The technology-focused Nasdaq Composite Index was down 8.05, or 0.5%, at 1624.16. The small-stock Russell 2000 was off 3.41, or 0.7%, at 502.43.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ConMed fell $7.17, or 30%, to $16.82, after it cut its fourth-quarter and 2009 outlook on lower-than-expected sales volume for equipment as hospital customers delayed and cut orders and a stronger dollar cut into international sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oshkosh rose 98 cents, or 9.5%, to 11.28. Late Friday the company said it received a contract with the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency to provide replacement parts for medium and heavy tactical vehicles. The contract, valued at as much as $1.12 billion over 10 years, follows a one-year deal that included seven options years that ended in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apple rose 2.48, or 2.7%, to $93.23, after Chief Executive Steve Jobs -- moving to quell speculation about his health -- said he is undergoing treatment for a "hormone imbalance," but intends to continue as the computer company's top executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European Markets</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European shares continued their 2009 winning streak, with investors pushing up telecommunications and utilities shares in particular.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pan-European Dow Jones Stoxx 600 index rose 2.1% to 208.69, bringing the rise for the first two trading sessions of 2009 to almost 5%. The Stoxx 600 index fell 46% in 2008, its worst year on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors bought shares of companies with stable dividend streams, including wireless telecommunications carrier <span class="companylink">Vodafone Group</span>, up 4.4%, and utility E.On, up 2.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Germany's DAX 30 index fell 0.2% to 4962.38, while the FTSE 100 index slipped 0.1% to 4558.95. France's CAC-40 index fell 0.6% to 3328.23.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rents for office space dropped 1.2% in the fourth quarter nationwide when such landlord concessions as free rent were taken into account, according to <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>., a New York real-estate research firm. It was the largest one-quarter decline since 2003, and came after rents rose 10.6% in 2007. Effective rents fell in 65 out of the 79 markets tracked by Reis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new data was another sign of the stress faced by many commercial-property investors who paid top dollar for office buildings in recent years, relying on easy credit and projections of continued rent growth. In many cases, the expected rent increases weren't justified by demand, said Chris Ludeman, president of brokerage in the Americas for commercial broker <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently, commercial real estate had fared better than residential real estate, where plummeting prices helped tip the economy into recession. But lately, rising vacancies have caused problems for owners of hotels, office buildings, stores, warehouses and other income properties. Industry executives have asked the federal government to help spur commercial real-estate lending, fearing owners will be unable to refinance properties as their debt comes due.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers and office-property owners say most business tenants are giving up space or are sticking with what they have as they retrench. Chuck Schreiber, chief executive of Newport Beach, Calif. based KBS Realty Advisors, which manages $6.5 billion in real-estate assets through affiliated companies, said that only 5% to 10% of tenants with leases expiring are interested in taking on more space, down from 20% in normal times.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, office tenants vacated 42 million square feet more of office space than they took -- or 1.5 square miles. That brought the U.S. vacancy rate up to 14.4% from 12.6% a year ago, according to Reis. Reis research director Victor Calanog said he expected vacancy rates to rise through 2010, likely pushing rents down further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in vacancy comes as some companies cut back on expenses and others go out of business. In New York, Monday Properties Chief Executive Anthony Westreich is looking to fill a 70,000 square-foot floor being vacated by former financial-services firm <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns Cos</span>., acquired in a shotgun marriage last year by <span class="companylink">J.P.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some battered commercial landlords find themselves trying to convince brokers and prospective tenants that they're not about to go bankrupt. "We are working to get as much protections against a landlord default as the landlords typically do against a tenant default," said Kevin Bender, a <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span> senior vice president based in southern California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markets hit hardest by the crises in finance and the housing markets saw some of the biggest declines. Rents in California's Orange County fell the most, by 3.6% in the fourth quarter. In New York City, rents were off 2.1%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending on U.S. construction projects is holding up better than expected, thanks to outlays on office buildings, lodging and power plants, but it is likely to falter in the coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. construction spending fell at a seasonally adjusted 0.6% annual rate in November to $1.078 trillion, the Commerce Department said Monday, following a revised October decline of 0.4% that was smaller than originally reported.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What Americans spend on their homes after buying them is mind-boggling. Various sources suggest that the nation's annual home-improvement bill -- do-it-yourself and professional remodeling, landscaping and major repair projects -- could be $400 billion or more. And until quite recently, much of it has been financed by borrowed money -- loans secured by houses that are declining in value month by month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not surprisingly, entire industries have arisen to get a piece of the action. Magazines and television programs entice homeowners to spend tens of thousands of dollars for new kitchens with custom-built cabinets, granite countertops and designer appliances. Architects and builders woo clients with bedrooms that have swollen into his-and-hers master suites with separate dressing rooms, sitting rooms and exercise areas. Simple bathrooms have become spas featuring expensive electronic toilets, multihead showers and Asian-inspired "soaking" tubs. Landscapers construct elegant "outdoor rooms" that feature dining and lounging areas, even kitchens, that are the equals of comparable rooms inside the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, a misguided "home as investment" mindset has encouraged owners to spend money on these kinds of expensive upgrades to boost their home's resale price and to stay even with the rest of the houses in the neighborhood. Ask any homeowner why he or she is remodeling, and fairly quickly you'll hear: "It will increase the value of the house."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reality check: Renovating might increase the price of your house. But it's most often a fool's bet because few home improvements break even, much less make a profit. Like new cars, most home improvements are lousy investments, losing one-fifth or more of their cost the day the contractor finally loads up and leaves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet there's still a strong argument for remodeling your house -- within limits. With real-estate values falling at double-digit rates, the homeowners' dream of rolling over the appreciation and equity they've accumulated in their current homes into a bigger, nicer place is getting harder to achieve. More and more newly house-poor homeowners are coming to terms with the inconvenient fact that they will need to stay in their homes longer, perhaps a lot longer, than they may have planned or wanted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The one-bedroom condo that was bought for just the newlyweds will now have to accommodate the new baby, too. And the cramped two-bedroom, one-bath bungalow will have to see the two teenagers all the way through high school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bucking the Price Trends</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can't buck the price trends in this troubled market. Even if you've been in your current home since well before the Big Bubble, you can't expect to make a killing by selling your house. What you can do is stay where you are and adapt your existing home to meet your current and future needs and desires. If you resist the urge to move, maintain your home well and are a smart renovator, you will retire your mortgage debt more quickly, spend less overall on housing, improve the quality and value of your home, and have more money to make other, more-lucrative long-term investments in stocks, bonds and even investment properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, there are varying degrees of remodeling, and some has to be done whatever the cost and the potential for return. It's not a discretionary expense to fix a broken window, replace a worn-out furnace or sometimes even to add a new bathroom. The buyer of a fixer-upper with a kitchen that hasn't seen a paint brush or a scouring pad since 1967 doesn't have a choice but to renovate. And a growing family has to do something when the kids are sleeping in the dining room because the living room is already taken.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the most important thing that any individual homeowner can do to protect the value of his biggest asset is to see that the house is always kept in good repair. There's no price bonus for the best-kept house on a shabby block, but there's a big discount on the worst house in a good neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your job as a homeowner is to protect the money you have spent on your biggest asset, while making sure that the ceiling doesn't collapse on your sleeping kids. The best way to do that is with a continuous and systematic whole-house maintenance program. Expect to pay up to 3% a year of your house's value on regular upkeep, repairs and special projects -- everything from the weekly yard service to annual furnace checkups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You'll pay a lot more if you are renovating. That's because most home-remodeling projects balloon far beyond what financial common sense dictates. Homeowners are often warned about "over-improving" their property -- making improvements that push a house too far out of line with what other nearby properties have -- but they are rarely warned about the extraordinary costs of remodeling. Nor are they warned about improving beyond what they can reasonably expect to recoup when they sell the place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remodeling magazine, a periodical for builders, publishes a widely quoted annual survey of the value of home improvements. The survey is not perfect, but it's the best widely available assessment of what's popular in home renovations and the only serious effort to gauge the financial impact that various projects have on the resale value of homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial Fantasies</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The depressing survey results lay bare the financial fantasies that most homeowners have when it comes to renovations and upgrades. Here are some samples: An upscale bathroom remodel cost about $51,000 in 2007 but homeowners could expect to recover only about $35,000 or 68% of the cost. Spend $220,000 on a new master bedroom suite, recoup just $141,000 (64%). Drop $109,000 for a new kitchen, make back just $81,000 (74%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imagine the looks of horror you'd earn from your friends if you dropped this bon mot at a dinner party: "Sub Zeros are nice, but if you really want to get the most bang for your buck -- 88% -- go with the fiber-cement siding."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The point is that most remodeling has gone far off the scale of reasonableness, especially when the principal justification for most remodeling projects is financial. Why in the world would anyone spend $109,000 to build a magazine-style kitchen when they can expect to recoup only 74% of the cost? Why in the world would anyone borrow the money and end up paying $100,000 more just in interest? What kind of investment is that?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's not to say that people shouldn't ever renovate -- families grow and most people will need more space or they'll want to make their home nicer. Just don't let your desires get so far ahead of your checkbook that there is no sound financial justification for your project. Keep these points in mind:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Balance your wants with your needs. Your expectations must fit your budget so that when you start planning a renovation, you don't wind up with every expensive accessory or item in the architect's or builder's inventory. Custom-built kitchen cabinets, granite counters and top-of-the-line, restaurant-style appliances look fantastic, but there are plenty of more modest and affordable alternatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't try keeping up with the neighbors. Unless you are fixing up your house to put it up for immediate sale, there is no valid financial argument for remodeling just to keep your home improvements on par with your neighbors'. And if you are renovating to sell, keep your expenses to a minimum. Unless you can expect that a specific buyer will pay more for a major renovation than it costs, you can't justify the expense financially.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Look for no-brainer economies. Yes, you can buy the cheaper hardware, but your big savings will come in cutting your labor costs. So get out your ratty clothes, pick up a hammer, and get to work. Save the difficult, dangerous or expensive stuff for the pros, but you should be able to trim a substantial portion of your renovation costs by doing whatever work you can yourself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Avoid long-term borrowing. Home improvements should be paid for out of pocket or with short-term loans of less than five years. Remember: You are losing money going into the project, and you don't want to increase your losses by paying years and years of interest as well. That new $73,000 upscale bathroom could end up costing you more than $150,000 if you pay for it by refinancing your first mortgage or taking out a new home-equity loan.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worries about the global economy kept stocks in the doldrums, despite talk of new policy moves to bolster the financial system and a promising report on construction spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At midday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 66.74 points, or 0.7%, at 8967.95. The blue-chip measure posted a triple-digit decline in early trading but recovered somewhat following the release of a Commerce Department report that U.S. construction spending fell about 0.6% in November, a smaller drop than expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span> 500-stock index was down 3.19, or 0.3% at 928.61, led lower by consumer-discretionary stocks, though energy and utilities categories were bright spots. The technology-focused Nasdaq Composite Index was down 8.05, or 0.5%, at 1624.16. The small-stock Russell 2000 was off 3.41, or 0.7%, at 502.43.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ConMed fell $7.17, or 30%, to $16.82, after it cut its fourth-quarter and 2009 outlook on lower-than-expected sales volume for equipment as hospital customers delayed and cut orders and a stronger dollar cut into international sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oshkosh rose 98 cents, or 9.5%, to 11.28. Late Friday the company said it received a contract with the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency to provide replacement parts for medium and heavy tactical vehicles. The contract, valued at as much as $1.12 billion over 10 years, follows a one-year deal that included seven options years that ended in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apple rose 2.48, or 2.7%, to $93.23, after Chief Executive Steve Jobs -- moving to quell speculation about his health -- said he is undergoing treatment for a "hormone imbalance," but intends to continue as the computer company's top executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European Markets</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European shares continued their 2009 winning streak, with investors pushing up telecommunications and utilities shares in particular.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pan-European Dow Jones Stoxx 600 index rose 2.1% to 208.69, bringing the rise for the first two trading sessions of 2009 to almost 5%. The Stoxx 600 index fell 46% in 2008, its worst year on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors bought shares of companies with stable dividend streams, including wireless telecommunications carrier <span class="companylink">Vodafone Group</span>, up 4.4%, and utility E.On, up 2.5%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. construction spending in November fell much less than expected as outlays rose in the commercial and government sectors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total spending decreased by 0.6% at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.078 trillion, the Commerce Department said Monday. Spending fell 0.4% in October; originally, October spending was seen 1.2% lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street had expected November construction spending to have gone down by 1.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential-construction spending plunged in November, down by 4.1% to $336.3 billion. Residential spending decreased 2.2% in October; it was originally seen down 3.5% for the month. Residential construction was 22.8% lower in November from November 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S.'s home builders have been reporting large financial losses as demand keeps falling even as they slash production. <span class="companylink">Hovnanian Enterprises Inc</span>., based in Red Bank, N.J., reported last month that its fiscal-fourth-quarter loss totaled $450.5 million as revenue fell 48%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonresidential-construction spending increased, despite the credit crunch and bad economy. It climbed by 1% in November. Outlays increased for roads, public-safety facilities, hotels and office buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private-sector construction spending during November decreased 1.5% to $756.4 billion. Spending fell 1.2% in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Public-construction spending increased 1.4% to $322 billion, even though the recession is hurting governments' tax revenue. October outlays rose 1.7%; originally, spending that month was seen rising 0.7%. Federal-government construction outlays rose 6%, and state and local spending -- much larger than federal spending in dollars -- increased 1% to $295.2 billion.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(See Correction &amp;Amplification below [mark] )</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California Rep. Joe Baca has long pushed legislation he said would "open the doors to the American Dream" for first-time home buyers in his largely Hispanic district. For many of them, those doors have slammed shut, quickly and painfully.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage lenders flooded Mr. Baca's San Bernardino, Calif., district with loans that often didn't require down payments, solid credit ratings or documentation of employment. Now, many of the Hispanics who became homeowners find themselves mired in the national housing mess. Nearly 9,200 families in his district have lost their homes to foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, immigrants to the U.S. have viewed buying a home as the ultimate benchmark of success. Between 2000 and 2007, as the Hispanic population increased, Hispanic homeownership grew even faster, increasing by 47%, to 6.1 million from 4.1 million, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Over that same period, homeownership nationally grew by 8%. In 2005 alone, mortgages to Hispanics jumped by 29%, with expensive nonprime mortgages soaring 169%, according to the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An examination of that borrowing spree by The Wall Street Journal reveals that it wasn't simply the mortgage market at work. It was fueled by a campaign by low-income housing groups, Hispanic lawmakers, a congressional Hispanic housing initiative, mortgage lenders and brokers, who all were pushing to increase homeownership among Latinos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The network included Mr. Baca, chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, whose district is 58% Hispanic and ranks No. 5 among all congressional districts in percentage of home loans not tailored for prime borrowers. The caucus launched a housing initiative called Hogar -- Spanish for home -- to work with industry and community groups to increase mortgage lending to Latinos. Mortgage companies provided funding to that group, and to the National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals, which fielded an army to make the loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In years past, minority borrowers seeking loans were often stopped cold by a practice called red-lining, in which lenders were reluctant to lend within particular geographical areas, often, it appeared, on the basis of race. But combined efforts to open the mortgage pipeline to Latinos proved successful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We saw what we refer to in the advocacy community as reverse red-lining," says Aracely Panameno, director of Latino affairs for the Center for Responsible Lending, an advocacy group. "Lenders were seeking out those borrowers and charging them through the roof," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Panameno says that during the height of the housing boom she sought to present the Hispanic Caucus with data showing how many Latinos were being steered into risky and expensive subprime loans. Hogar declined her requests, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the national housing market began unraveling, so did the fortunes of many of the new homeowners. National foreclosure statistics don't break out data by ethnicity or race. But there is evidence that Hispanic borrowers have been hard hit. In part, that's because of large Hispanic populations in areas where the housing bubble was pronounced, such as Southern California, Nevada and Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In U.S. counties where Hispanics account for more than 25% of the population, banks have taken back 6.7 homes per 1,000 residents since Jan. 1, 2006, compared with 4.6 per 1,000 residents in all counties, according to a Journal analysis of U.S. Census and RealtyTrac data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hispanic lawmakers and community groups have blamed subprime lenders, who specialize in making loans to customers with spotty credit histories. They complain that even solid borrowers were steered to those loans, which carry higher interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a written statement, Mr. Baca blamed the foreclosure crisis among Hispanics on borrowers' lack of "financial literacy" and on "lenders and brokers eager to make a bigger profit." He declined to be interviewed for this story.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Easy Credit</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a close look at the network of organizations pushing for increased mortgage lending reveals a more complicated picture. Subprime-industry executives were advisers to the Hogar housing initiative, and bankrolled more than $2 million of its research. Lawmakers and advocacy groups pushed hard for the easy credit that fueled the subprime phenomenon among Latinos. Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, who received donations from the lending industry and saw their constituents moving into new homes, pushed for eased lending standards, which led to problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage lenders appear to have regarded Latinos as a largely untapped demographic. Many were first or second-generation U.S. residents who didn't own homes. Many Hispanic families had multiple wage earners working multiple cash jobs, but had no savings or established credit history to allow them to qualify for traditional loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Congressional Hispanic Caucus created Hogar in 2003 to work with industry and community groups to increase mortgage lending to Latinos. At that time, the national Latino homeownership rate was 47%, compared with 68% for the overall population. Hogar called the figure "alarming," and said a concerted effort was required to ensure that "by the end of the decade Latinos will share equally in the American Dream of homeownership."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hogar's backers included many companies that ran into trouble in mortgage markets: <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, both now under federal control; <span class="companylink">Countrywide Financial Corp</span>., sold last year to <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>.; <span class="companylink">Washington Mutual Inc</span>., taken over by the government and sold to <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;Co</span>.; and <span class="companylink">New Century Financial Corp</span>. and Ameriquest Mortgage Corp., both now defunct.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hogar's ties to the subprime industry were substantial. A <span class="companylink">Washington Mutual</span> vice president served as chairman of its advisory committee. Companies that donated $150,000 a year got the right to place a research fellow who would conduct Hogar's studies, which were used by industry lobbyists. For donations of $100,000 a year, Hogar offered to provide news releases from the Hispanic Caucus promoting a lender's commercial products for the Latino market, according to the group's literature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hogar worked with <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> on a two-year examination of Latino homeownership in 63 congressional districts. The study found Hispanic ownership on the rise thanks to "new flexible mortgage loan products" that the industry was adopting. It recommended further easing of down-payment and underwriting standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representatives for Hogar declined repeated requests for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals, one of Hogar's sponsors, advised the group, shared research data and built a large membership to market loans to Latinos. By 2005, its ranks had grown to 16,000 agents and mortgage brokers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The association, called Nahrep, received funding from some of the same players that funded Hogar. Some 22 corporate sponsors, including Countrywide and <span class="companylink">Washington Mutual</span>, together paid the association $2 million a year to attend conferences and forums where lenders could pitch their loan products to loan brokers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While home prices were rising, the lending risk seemed minimal, says Tim Sandos, Narhep's president. "We would say, 'Is he breathing? OK, we'll give him a mortgage,'" he recalls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nahrep's 2006 convention in Las Vegas was called "Place Your Bets on Home Ownership." Countrywide Chairman Angelo Mozilo spoke, as did former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros, a force in Latino housing developments in the West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders' Contributions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Countrywide and other sponsors contracted with Nahrep to set up regional events where they could present loan products to loan brokers and their customers. Mr. Sandos says his organization doesn't get paid to promote particular lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the height of the subprime lending boom, in 2005, banking and finance companies gave at least $2.3 million in campaign contributions to members of the Hispanic Caucus, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October 2008, a charitable foundation set up by Mr. Baca received $25,000 from AmeriDream Inc., a nonprofit housing company and Hogar sponsor. Mr. Baca has long backed AmeriDream's controversial seller-financed down-payment assistance program. AmeriDream provided down-payment money to buyers, a cost that was covered by home builders in the form of donations to the nonprofit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New housing legislation last fall outlawed the program. Mr. Baca is cosponsoring a bill that would allow AmeriDream and similar nonprofits to resume arranging seller-financed down-payment assistance to low-income Federal Housing Administration borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such seller-financed loans comprise one-third of the loans backed by the FHA, and have defaulted at nearly triple the rate of other FHA-insured loans, according to agency spokesman William Glavin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a news release, AmeriDream said the donation to Mr. Baca's foundation was intended to fund the purchase of gear for firefighters in his district. Local news reports say the foundation gave away $36,000 in scholarships this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Internal Revenue Service records indicate that Mr. Baca's son, Joe Baca Jr., has an annual salary of $51,800 as executive director of the Joe Baca Foundation, which is run out of the congressman's home. Joe Baca Jr. says he currently is taking only about half that listed salary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Baca's office declined to comment on the AmeriDream contribution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Baca remains opposed to strict lending rules. "We need to keep credit easily accessible to our minority communities," he said in a statement released by his office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage lending to Hispanics took off between 2004 and 2007, powered by nonprime loans. The biggest jump occurred in 2005. The 169% increase in nonprime mortgages to Hispanics that year outpaced a 122% gain for blacks, and a 110% increase for whites, according to a Journal analysis of mortgage-industry and federal-housing data. Nonprime mortgages carry high interest rates and are tailored to borrowers with low credit scores or few assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between 2004 and 2007, black borrowers were offered nonprime loans at a slightly higher rate than Hispanics, but the overall number of Hispanic borrowers was much larger. From 2004 to 2005, total nonprime home loans to Hispanics more than tripled to $69 billion from $19 billion, and peaked in 2006 at $73 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tricks of the Trade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage brokers became a key portion of the lending pipeline. Phi Nguygn, a former broker, worked at two suburban Washington-area firms that employed hundreds of loan originators, most of them Latino. Countrywide and other subprime lenders sent account representatives to brokerage offices frequently, he says. Countrywide didn't respond to calls requesting comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representatives of subprime lenders passed on "little tricks of the trade" to get borrowers qualified, he says, such as adding a borrower's name to a relative's bank account, an illegal maneuver. Mr. Nguygn says he's now volunteering time to help borrowers facing foreclosure negotiate with banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many loans to Hispanic borrowers were based not on actual income histories but on a borrower's "stated income." These so-called no-doc loans yielded higher commissions and involved less paperwork.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another problem was so-called NINA -- no income, no assets -- loans. They were originally intended for self-employed people of means. But <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> executives worried about abuse, according to documents obtained by Congress. The program "appears to target borrowers who would have trouble qualifying for a mortgage if their financial position were adequately disclosed," said a staff memo to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> Chairman Richard Syron. "It appears they are disproportionately targeted toward Hispanics."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> says it tightened down-payment requirements in 2004 and stopped buying NINA loans altogether in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's very hard to get in front of a train loaded with highly profitable activities and stop it," says Ronald Rosenfeld, chairman of the Federal Housing Finance Board, a government agency that regulates home loan banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regions of the country where the housing bubble grew biggest, such as California, Nevada and Florida, are heavily populated by Latinos, many of whom worked in the construction industry during the housing boom. When these markets began to weaken, bad loans depressed the value of neighboring properties, creating a downward spiral. Neighborhoods are now dotted with vacant homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By late 2008, one in every nine households in San Joaquin County, Calif., was in default or foreclosure -- 24,049 of them, according to Federal Reserve data. Banks have already taken back 55 of every 1,000 homes. In Riverside, Calif., 66,838 houses are owned by banks or were headed in that direction as of October. In Prince William County, Va., a Washington suburb, 11,685 homes, or one in 11, was in default or foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gerardo Cadima, a Bolivian immigrant who works as an electrician, bought a home in suburban Virginia for $330,000, with no money down. "I said this is too good to be true," he recalls. "I'm 23 years old, with a family, buying my own house."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When work slowed last year, Mr. Cadima ran into trouble on his adjustable-rate mortgage. "The payments were increasing, and the price of the house was starting to drop," he says. "I started to think, is this really worth it?" He stopped making payments and his home was sold at auction for $180,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the wake of the housing slump, some participants in the Hispanic lending network are expressing second thoughts about the push. Mr. Sandos, head of Nahrep, says that some of his group's past members, lured by big commissions, steered borrowers into expensive loans that they couldn't afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nahrep has filed complaints with state regulators against some of those brokers, he says. Their actions go against Nahrep's mission of building "sustainable" Latino home ownership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, James Scruggs of Northern Virginia Legal Services is swamped with Latino borrowers facing foreclosure. "We see loan applications that are complete fabrications," he says. Typically, he says, everything was marketed to borrowers in Spanish, right up until the closing, which was conducted in English.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are not talking about people working for the World Bank or the IMF," he says. "We are talking about day laborers, janitors, people who work in restaurants, people who do babysitting."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two such borrowers work in Mr. Scrugg's office. Sandra Cardoza, a $28,000-a-year office manager, is now $30,000 in arrears on loans totaling $370,000. "Her loan documents say she makes more than me," says Mr. Scruggs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nahrep agents are networking on how to negotiate "short sales" to banks, where Hispanic homeowners sell their homes at a loss in order to escape onerous mortgages. The association has a new how-to guide: "The American Nightmare: Strategies for Preventing, Surviving and Overcoming Foreclosure."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Victoria E. Knight </div><div>1020 words</div><div>5 January 2009</div><div>11:53</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Personal Finance</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In these rough economic times, funding long-term care poses a challenge for seniors and their families. There are a range of strategies you can pursue, though.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Older Americans who had banked on selling their homes to finance care in assisted living facilities and retirement communities have seen their dreams go up in smoke amidst a housing market meltdown. At the same time, their investment portfolios have nose-dived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For people without long-term care insurance, which is the majority, the financial hit can be hard if care is needed. The average cost of a private room at a nursing room runs $76,500 per person annually, while a one-year stay in a one-bedroom unit in an assisted living facility costs $36,000 and periodic care from a home health assistant at $18,000 or more per year doesn't come cheap. While there are no easy answers, shopping around, switching the care setting, pooling family finances and looking at loan options can be conduits to affordable care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many independent living and assisted-living facilities, in particular newer facilities or those that embarked on ambitious expansion plans when the economy was riding high, are offering specials to boost flagging occupancy rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Many facilities are offering to defer rent until seniors can sell their homes or are offering lower introductory rates for the first six months" as sweeteners, says John Temple, chief operating officer at A Place for Mom Inc., a national senior housing referral service. (The service is provided free to consumers. A Place for Mom is compensated by the facilities when a senior is placed).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many facilities will waive the "community fee," a deposit typically equivalent to one-months rent, to those who ask. The best deals to be had are often at smaller residential homes, as they need to fill vacancies quickly and they have more latitude to cut individual deals, according to Temple.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Continuing-care retirement communities, which offer more health services as seniors age, typically require entrance fees of hundreds of thousands of dollars plus monthly fees. Cheryl J. Sherrard, a certified financial planner at Rinehart &amp;Associates in Charlotte, says switching to a smaller apartment can be a money-saving strategy for older Americans who've set their hearts on moving into a specific retirement community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've seen communities allow couples to move in with a percentage of the entry fee due initially, but a delay on the remainder being due for a period of six months after move-in," giving seniors wiggle to complete the sale of a house, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Retirement communities backed by nonprofit religious organizations can be a more affordable option," says Karen Schaeffer, president of Schaeffer Financial in Rockville, Md. (These communities welcome people of all beliefs).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Temple recommends asking independent and assisted-living facilities about "non-premium rooms" that can be real bargains, but generally aren't advertised. Longer walks to the dining room and less desirable layouts or views account for the cheaper rates. Having a roommate might not be everyone's cup of tea, but "companion rates" can shave $1,000 a month off rent for single seniors who are willing to share, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Widening your geographic search even by just a few miles can produce more budget-friendly options, says Karen Altfest, vice president of L.J. Altfest &amp;Co. Inc., a fee-only financial planning firm in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Family members can pitch in toward the cost of care in a variety of ways. For instance, individuals can make gifts of up to $12,000 per person per year without paying a federal gift tax. That exclusion amount will increase to $13,000 in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another option is an intra-family loan. This could provide a mechanism for adult children to lend money to cash-strapped parents who need funds now to pay for care until they can sell their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A reverse mortgage is another option. Reverse mortgages enable home owners aged 62 or older, who own their home outright or have a small mortgage balance, to convert home equity into cash without selling the house. The Home Equity Conversion Mortgage, or HECM, insured by the Federal Housing Administration and backed by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD, is the most popular kind. Lending institutions also offer their own proprietary products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The amount you can borrow will depend on your age, how much your home is worth and current interest rates. For a HECM the limit is $417,000, proprietary products may allow you to borrow more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Payments can be taken as a lump sum, in regular installments or as needed, or through a combination of these options. The accrued principle and interest comes due when the last borrower dies, sells the home or moves out permanently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A big drawback of a reverse mortgage is the high fees, which closely mirror the closing costs on a regular mortgage. For this reason, says Sue Hunt, a housing counseling programs manager for Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Greater Atlanta, reverse mortgages tend to make the most sense for people who want to spend the rest of their lives in their homes and whose total income, including the loan, will be sufficient to cover all their future expenses, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another consideration is what, if anything, you plan to leave your heirs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With any type of loan, it's important to ensure you understand the fees, interest rates, repayment terms. For instance, an important safety feature of a HECM is that your payments from the lender are guaranteed by the federal government. Plus, if your home is sold for an amount lower than the value of the loan neither you nor your heirs will be liable for the balance, which isn't always the case with proprietary products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And finally, whatever financial strategy you're thinking of pursuing don't forget to run it by your tax adviser before you sign on any dotted lines.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jim Sollisch </div><div>529 words</div><div>3 January 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Opinion; A7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So now we know what happens when too many people who have too few assets buy too much house with the help of too many risky mortgage products and too little oversight. And while there's plenty of blame to go around -- unethical mortgage brokers, greedy bankers and irresponsible homeowners -- one culprit continues to get off scot-free: HGTV.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's right. The cable network HGTV is the real villain of the economic meltdown. As the viewership reached a critical mass over the past decade -- HGTV is now broadcast into 91 million homes -- homeowners began experiencing deep angst. Suddenly no one but the most slovenly and unambitious were satisfied with their houses. It didn't matter if you lived in an apartment or a gated community, one episode of "House Hunters" or "What's My House Worth?" and you were convinced you needed more. More square feet. More granite. More stainless steel appliances. More landscaping. More media rooms. More style. You deserved it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you had any doubts about your ability to afford such luxuries, all you had to do was look at the 20-something couple in the latest episode choosing between three houses. Should they go for the fixer-upper, priced at $425,000? Or the one with the pool for $550,000? What about the one with room to grow for $675,000?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"How much money can these people possibly make?" I shout at my wife before wrestling the remote from her house-hungry little hand and switching it to the nearest sports program. "The guy can barely string together two sentences!"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet on episode after episode for this entire irrational decade, HGTV pumped up the housing bubble by parading the most mediocre, unworthy-looking homeowners into our living rooms to watch while they put their tacky, run-of-the-mill tract homes on the market for twice what they paid and then went out and bought houses with price tags too obscene to repeat. You couldn't watch these shows without concluding that you must be an idiot and a loser if you lived in a house you could actually afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HGTV is an evil empire that never rests. You can loathe your current domicile 24/7 with programs such as "Stagers" (move a few things around and double the value of your home); "Designed to Sell" (you can sell your house, even if the house next to yours is in foreclosure); "Design on a Dime" (see, it's cheap); and "Property Virgins" (losing your virginity was fun, wasn't it?) Every show features highly attractive hosts who show you how to "unlock the hidden potential" in your home, how to turn a $10 thrift-store table into a "wow" media center, and how to make everything "pop." Pop is the word of choice on HGTV.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ironic, isn't it, given the fact that pop is the sound we keep hearing from the McMansion-sized housing bubble HGTV created.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What began as a bad year for real estate turned into one of the worst on record, driven by an unprecedented drop in home prices, a tide of foreclosures and a credit crisis whose magnitude few anticipated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I thought it would be a bad year," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com. "I didn't think it was going to be a complete washout."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And as bad as 2008 was, few are ready to say the worst is over. The troubles in the residential sector are expected to continue, while problems are just beginning for the other side of the real-estate market -- office buildings, hotels, shopping malls and other commercial properties -- as the recession starts to have an effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The question on everyone's mind is, 'How is the government going to try to solve this?'" said Kenneth Rosen, chairman of the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the residential side, many are urging the Obama administration to push for broad programs to limit foreclosures, stimulate demand for homes, and stop the slide in prices. The Treasury Department is considering a plan that would push down rates on home mortgages to 4.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the government's highest-profile efforts so far, Hope for Homeowners, lets banks move borrowers into government-insured loans if lenders agree to write down a portion of the principal. But very little of the $300 billion pledged by the Department of Housing and Urban Development has been put to use so far, in part because investors who hold those loans would incur big losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial developers are also hoping for a lifeline from Washington, perhaps guaranteeing chunks of new commercial mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House prices fell 23% from their July 2006 peak to October 2008, the latest data available, based on the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price index, which tracks home values in 20 cities. Mr. Zandi expects an additional 10% drop to a bottom late this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One in 10 homeowners with a mortgage is either in foreclosure or delinquent on payments, the Mortgage Bankers Association said last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks have tried loan-modification programs to stem the crisis but with limited success. More than half the mortgage loans that were modified were more than 30 days late six months later, according to a government report last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regions that had been booming were hit especially hard by the bursting of the real-estate bubble. In the Southwest and Florida, homes lie vacant along the winding streets and cul-de-sacs of brand-new subdivisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Phoenix, home values have fallen 41% from their peak in June 2006. "Boomers who we counted on coming down here when they retire can't sell their homes in Chicago or Michigan or other places, so they're not coming," said Betsy Kurasch, a local real-estate agent with ReMax Achievers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street is feeling the effects as well as Main Street. Securitization, the packaging of loans into investment products, had allowed new mortgages to be issued at huge volumes and helped to inflate the housing bubble. It essentially disappeared as credit markets seized up amid problems with subprime loans, with some of the biggest financial institutions in the country taking a hit. Residential-mortgage originations fell to $300 billion in the third quarter -- a 50% drop from a year earlier, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, a trade publication.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For commercial real estate, the troubles that lie ahead could hurt pension funds and college endowments that moved money into real estate in recent years as the market was booming, as well as real-estate magnates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commercial market "is going to be ugly for the next 12 to 24 months," said Michael Restuccia, chairman of the San Joaquin County (Calif.) Employees' Retirement Association. "Not just bad, but ugly."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A preview of the ugliness -- as well as opportunities for investors with cash to spend -- came last spring, when loans coming due forced New York property titan Harry Macklowe to sell some of his prized office towers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's hard to know how far commercial-property prices have fallen because the lack of credit has made it hard to buy big buildings. In the office market, for instance, only $1 billion of deals on fewer than 50 properties closed across the U.S. in November, according to research firm <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>. That's a 90% drop from November 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stock market provides clues to how investors are pricing commercial real estate, and the picture isn't pretty. The Dow Jones Equity All REIT Index, which tracks many public real-estate company stocks, fell 40% in the last three months of 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The poster child so far: Retail landlord <span class="companylink">General Growth Properties Inc</span>., which received an extension last month on an overdue loan as it struggled to pay down its $27 billion debt load. The share price of the Chicago-based owner of more than 200 U.S. malls plunged to $1.29 from $41.18 over the course of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors are especially concerned about sectors of the market most exposed to cutbacks in spending by consumers and corporations: shopping malls, warehouses, office buildings, and most of all, hotels, which are suffering as consumers and businesses cut spending on travel. Companies involved in health-care facilities and senior housing are considered somewhat safer, in part because of the coming wave of retiring baby boomers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are questions facing commercial real estate this year: How much further will real-estate stocks fall? Will property owners with debt coming due find ways to refinance? And will the investors who committed billions to commercial property in the past few years be willing and able to make good on those commitments?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For economists now to make forecasts is a pretty difficult thing," said Ray Torto, chief global economist at real-estate firm <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>. "All of our models are outside the territory in which they've been built."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although New York has been at the epicenter of the financial crisis, housing prices in the city haven't dropped nearly as fast as cities elsewhere in the U.S. The same is true of the financial hubs of Boston and Charlotte, N.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that doesn't mean these cities are skirting the worst of the housing bust. Rather, markets where price declines have been slightest may be in worse shape, because prices still have further to fall before enough buyers step in to bring housing activity to normal. Meanwhile, heavy foreclosure activity in hard-hit areas like Phoenix, Las Vegas and San Diego are bringing prices into equilibrium. Those cities may be closer to a turnaround.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October, single-family-home prices in the New York metropolitan area were down 12% from the all-time high they reached in 2006, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home-price indexes. That is roughly half the decline registered by the 20-city index and well short of Phoenix's 41% drop. A separate index of New York-area condo prices was down just 4% from its peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the reason New York housing prices have held up is that lot of New Yorkers are holding on to their homes rather than selling for less than the Joneses got in 2007. Esty Lobovits, a 31-year-old lawyer in Manhattan, has been looking to buy an apartment since the summer but says she isn't willing to pay what she considers to be inflated prices. Many apartments she has viewed are empty or filled only with staged furniture. Although sellers have been open to negotiation, Ms. Lobovits says prices haven't budged as much as she would expect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the language of Wall Street, with asking prices not dropping to levels where bidders like Ms. Lobovits will pick them, the market isn't "clearing." The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of New York</span> noted in its "beige book" survey of regional conditions last month that many would-be buyers have opted to rent out their apartments rather than sell, driving rental prices lower -- particularly in higher-end buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While New York is probably an extreme example, its inertia is being repeated in many of the other housing markets that have yet to see sharp declines. Some owners with hefty mortgages can't face selling their house for less than they owe, but also, many don't want to sell at a steep discount to what a house down the street might have fetched two years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in California, housing sales have picked up considerably, as buyers take advantage of foreclosed homes. In October, sales of existing, detached homes was more than double the year-earlier level, according to the California Association of Realtors. In the Los Angeles area, single-family-home prices are 34% below their peak, according to S&amp;P/Case-Shiller, while prices in San Francisco and San Diego are down 36%.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anton Troianovski </div><div>858 words</div><div>31 December 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Real Estate; C8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2008 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As their worst year on record finally ends, real-estate investment trusts are bracing for a Darwinian 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survivors will be companies with lots of cash, small development pipelines and low debt loads. Those REITs could use the industry turmoil to expand by snapping up assets on the cheap. Some of their debt-laden competitors, on the other hand, could be goners if the credit freeze continues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You're going to have this bifurcation of the REIT industry into haves and have-nots," said Mike Kirby, who analyzes the industry for research firm Green Street Advisors Inc. "The REIT industry haves are going to be viewed as having very exciting growth opportunities, whereas the have-nots are going to be in hand-to-hand combat to fix balance-sheet problems."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During 2008, investors treated almost all REITs with a heavy dose of skepticism. Of the 114 stocks tracked by the Dow Jones Equity All REIT index, only four had positive returns. The biggest winner: <span class="companylink">Pittsburgh &amp;West Virginia Railroad</span>, a tiny company that owns the land beneath a small railroad in Appalachia, rose 50%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, the DJ equity REIT index plunged 40%, including reinvestment of dividends. It was the worst year on record since the index's inception in 1989.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next year, where the line will be drawn between the winners and the losers depends on when the debt markets open up again and how deep the recession will become. The recession already is reducing demand for real estate as property managers struggle to lease empty space. And the longer the debt markets' recovery takes, the more likely it is that comparatively healthy companies will be dragged into the gathering commercial real-estate mess.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mall giant <span class="companylink">Simon Property Group Inc</span>., the largest U.S. retail REIT, is a case in point. On the one hand, Simon should be in a position to acquire some attractive shopping malls at bargain prices, including some that were recently put up for sale by <span class="companylink">General Growth Properties Inc</span>., a Simon rival. Simon has a limited development pipeline, and its liabilities-to-assets ratio now stands at a relatively healthy 53%, according to Green Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, Simon is vulnerable to the economic downturn. If additional retailers fail, Simon's revenue and earnings could suffer, leaving it ill-positioned to make acquisitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Simon already has seen its stock price slide 47% in the fourth quarter and a Green Street analysis found that the leverage of Simon -- as well as 32 other REITs -- could top 70% if the credit freeze goes on and commercial real-estate valuations continue to drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You're going to have a lot of problem loans no matter what happens in the course of the next several years, and that could either be ugly or it could just be horrific," Mr. Kirby said. A higher leverage ratio makes it harder for a company to access new debt in order to refinance or make an acquisition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Simon Chief Executive David Simon acknowledged the uncertainty ahead. "Our No. 1 focus is our existing portfolio and our cash flow there," he said. "We'll be in the market for undervalued real estate, but it's hard to pinpoint exactly when that time will come. ... My guess is, at some point in '09, there will be a lot of opportunities that it will be hard not to execute on."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The silver lining of the pessimism coursing through the market is that the companies whose shares were hardest hit in 2008 will be poised for a big recovery if debt becomes available faster than expected. There would be plenty of those to go around: Forty-four of the 114 equity REITs tracked by Dow Jones lost more than half their value this year, including some of the real-estate world's biggest names. Ten were down 80% or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REIT sectors most susceptible to dropping demand -- including companies that own hotels, offices, retail space and warehouses -- took the biggest hits this year. Sectors seen as well-positioned to withstand a recession, such as self-storage and health care, did better but still finished the year in negative territory. Only outlet centers, up 1%, finished in positive territory among the equity REIT sectors tracked by Dow Jones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sharp declines in REIT stocks in the fourth quarter -- the index was actually up 2% for the year at the end of September -- have led some market observers to suspect that investors already have priced in big declines in revenue for commercial real estate in the next few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The earnings of the companies really haven't fallen off the cliff, [but] we expect in the next couple of years rents are going to be more challenging," said Jim Trowbridge, a portfolio manager of the <span class="companylink">AIM Real Estate Fund</span>. "It appears as though that's significantly factored into share prices already. ... Investors know what's happening."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although New York has been at the epicenter of the financial crisis, housing prices in the city haven't dropped nearly as fast as cities elsewhere. The same is true of the financial hubs of Boston and Charlotte, N.C.</p>

Esty Lobovits, a 31-year-old lawyer in Manhattan, has been looking to buy an apartment since the summer but says she isn't willing to pay what she considers to be inflated prices. Many apartments she has viewed are empty or filled only with staged furniture, and brokers are more aggressive, sometimes following up with her broker even if Ms. Lobovits hasn't placed a bid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although sellers have been open to negotiation, Ms. Lobovits says prices haven't budged as much as she would expect. About two months ago she looked at a one-bedroom, first-floor apartment for about $700,000, roughly $100,000 more than comparable apartments. "I haven't seen any steep lowering of prices," she says. "It's a little surprising to me that [sellers] wouldn't want to be more aggressive."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the language of Wall Street, with asking prices not dropping to levels where bidders like Ms. Lobovits will pick them, the market isn't "clearing."

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The homes that offer the most for the least are the ones the buyers buy," says Matt Battiata, of Battiata Real Estate Group in Carlsbad, Calif. But as activity has picked up it has led to a decrease in prices -- the opposite from during the boom. "Every sale is lower than the one before it," Mr. Battiata says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are parts of California where, if anything, prices may be starting to bottom out a little bit," says Columbia Business School economist Christopher Mayer. "One of the things the wave of foreclosures has done is it forced the market to clear."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York's slower adjustment is a more typical housing-market decline, with a deteriorating economy grinding down values over time. The last time prices in the area fell, starting in 1988, it took three years before they hit their trough, at 15% lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time, the price decline may be far more severe. While subprime mortgages didn't play as big a direct role in the New York real-estate market as elsewhere, there were plenty of Wall Streeters who made their living off of packaging those loans into the complex securities and trading them. Even last year, with the housing market fraying, Wall Street pulled in record bonuses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Right now, people are still living on last year's bonus," says <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span> economist Ethan Harris, who is based in New York. "You can sort of feel the local economy on the edge of a cliff."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Lester Aldrich </div><div>731 words</div><div>26 December 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Markets; C10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2008 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Lumber producers and traders may be staring at a long, cold winter, but some say the market is laying the foundation for a rally next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, for now, it may be hard to see the forest through the trees as the current lumber situation is gloomy. Housing starts are down to levels unseen in decades, and no one seems to want lumber or plywood in any quantity. Lumber mills are taking extended downtime or are closing permanently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, by the end of 2008, the washout of lumber mills will be done, said Matt Layman, publisher of Layman's Lumber Guide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At that point, lumber production will be at historic lows, and there isn't any reason to think it will recover soon, he said. Housing starts are off 75% from the 2.2 million starts of just a few years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the desire to own a home continues to grow with the population, Mr. Layman said. Once the credit-market crunch eases and financing becomes available again, the real-estate market could see significant gains from that pent-up demand, creating a shortage of new houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bob Book, senior lumber analyst at T.J. &amp;R. Trading Corp., said there is some interest in owning January-contract Chicago Mercantile Exchange lumber futures because deliveries won't arrive until mid-February. This avoids year-end inventory taxes and gets product to the dealers later in the winter and closer to a spring rally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ashley Boeckholt, sales manager at Chicago-based <span class="companylink">Bloch Lumber Co</span>., said the declining production and lack of interest in owning wood are two of the three ingredients needed to produce a rally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once production drops below demand, any slight uptick in consumption could ignite a rally. What might spark that demand rise will likely be unforeseen, he said</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 90% to 95% of lumber buyers want to run with low inventory, Mr. Boeckholt said. At this rate, he said, the market is leaving itself open for a rally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding to this is the incremental rate of shutdowns by small U.S. mills, further limiting supply. By now, many lumber traders are numb to news of more closures, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The wild card in predicting a sharp 2009 lumber rally, Mr. Layman said, is Russia's action regarding a log-export tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In early November, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin announced a long-awaited log-export tax would be delayed for nine to 12 months. The tax would have virtually closed the border to log exports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Putin didn't cancel plans to impose the tax, and customers like China and Finland are seeking alternate supply sources, Mr. Layman said. For him and other market analysts, the only viable alternative to Russia is Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Russia should close its doors to log exports via a high export tax, China and other countries will come to Canada, Mr. Layman said. And with the low rate of North American lumber production, a "massive" lumber price rally could ensue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other commodity markets on Wednesday:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CRUDE OIL: Prices fell sharply on Wednesday after U.S. fuel inventories rose by more than expected, signaling continued weak demand. Light, sweet crude for February delivery settled $3.63, or 9.3%, lower at $35.35 a barrel on the <span class="companylink">New York Mercantile Exchange</span>. Oil inventories fell by 3.1 million barrels in the week ended Dec. 19, but gasoline stocks grew by 3.3 million barrels, and distillates, including heating oil and diesel, saw a build of 1.8 million barrels. The data, from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, reflected an increase in refinery runs, but no corresponding recovery in demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GOLD: Prices on the Comex division of Nymex rose slightly with the help of a weak U.S. dollar against the euro and technical-chart related factors. Analysts say gold is likely to continue keying on the dollar's fortunes in the near term. Nearby December gold rose $9.90 to $847.10 a troy ounce, while most-active February also rose $9.90 to settle at $848.00. Market participants said trading volume was light, and the same thin conditions are expected in Friday's session.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">See Corrections &amp;Amplifications below [mark]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It could have been architecture's golden era.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last decade, American homeowners flush with credit poured a staggering $4.7 trillion into building houses. Yet remarkably few new ideas resulted, say some of the nation's leading architects. "It seems a lot of the innovation wasn't in how houses were built or how they look or function," says architect Tom Kundig. "Instead the novelty was in financing." And Marianne Cusato adds, "The 'more is more' mentality took over.... Developers attempted to differentiate by building a small town in your house...a media room, a café, a hair salon."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some designers triumphed. They made some homes smaller, with movable exterior walls to encourage residents to spend more time outdoors. Glass walls allowed occupants to feel they were floating on treetops. More homes incorporated recycled materials, wind and geothermal energy, and architects used new digital technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wall Street Journal talked to 15 experts, including leading architects and the chief curator of architecture and design at New York's Museum of Modern Art, to assemble a list of the five most influential and inspiring houses produced during the housing boom. Here they are:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. MAISON À BORDEAUX, <span class="companylink">Office for Metropolitan Architecture</span>, Bordeaux, France, 1998</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel's clear favorite. Architect Rem Koolhaas inverted the traditional concept of a wheelchair-accessible home for a client who was partly paralyzed in a car accident. Set on a hill in France's Bordeaux region, the 5,300-square-foot home was conceived as three stacked houses. At the center of the structure is a large mechanical lift that ascends all three levels -- none is complete without the platform.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They asked us to do a house which would not visibly remind anyone, including themselves, of his condition," Mr. Koolhaas says. "We interpreted the house as an extension of everything he could still do, rather than to compensate for everything he could no longer do." Maison ` Bordeaux "challenges everyday notions about how you move in and around a house," says New York architect Annabelle Selldorf.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. VilLA NM, UNStudio, Kenoza Lake, N.Y., 2007</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Software advances let architects create new kinds of spaces in homes. VilLA NM, by architects Ben van Berkel and Caroline Bos, "takes the glass box and ties it in a kind of spatial knot," says Thomas Hanrahan, dean of the Pratt Institute's School of Architecture. "It's a test case as to what's possible when you apply the computer to architecture." Rather than coming together at right angles, walls curve together like skin around an exoskeleton. A fire destroyed the 3,200-square-foot house in February, but it remains a favorite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. TYLER HOUSE, Rick Joy Architects, Tubac, Ariz., 2000</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With its reinforced concrete walls and rusty corrugated-iron rooftops, the Tyler House stands in a desert 50 miles south of Tucson. Architect Rick Joy is admired for his use of local materials such as rusted metal, adobe and rammed earth (compressed sand, clay and gravel) to help relate his modernism to the arid region. The 2,700-square-foot house "evokes the theme of a rusty shelter in a cowboy camp," says Columbia University Architecture Professor Kenneth Frampton. "There's a strong attempt to inflect the houses according to the region they are in."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4. VISITING ARTISTS HOUSE, Jim Jennings Architecture, Geyserville, Calif., 2003</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two nearly parallel, 200-foot-long concrete walls slice into the crest of a hill, defining the 1,700-square-foot residence of two suites and artists' studios. Built on a former sheep ranch that now contains a sculpture garden, the retreat is considered a prime example of a small private rural house standing over a dramatic landscape -- a common juxtaposition architects explored during this period. "It's concrete. It's extremely simple. It fits into the site," says Los Angeles architect Thom Mayne.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5. PICTURE WINDOW HOUSE, Shigeru Ban Architects, Shizuoka, Japan, 2002</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Architect Shigeru Ban captures panoramic ocean views by turning the building itself into a frame. The bottom floor is a wide rectangular box open to the elements, while the living quarters upstairs are contained by floor-to-ceiling glass. "It's bold. There's a hole in the house that is functioning as a window, and then there's this vast window within the house itself," says New York architect Deborah Berke. "It's a little richer for me than his other work because it has multiple takes on the picture window."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Israeli diamond merchant Lev Leviev became an overnight sensation in Manhattan real estate last year when he paid prime prices for the old headquarters of the New York Times and the Apthorp, a tony apartment building on the Upper West Side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now both projects are suffering. The Apthorp's partners are warring in court, the condominium-conversion project is in danger of defaulting, and only one unit has sold in the six months since the $1 billion project was announced, according to court documents and interviews with people familiar with the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, Mr. Leviev filed an emergency injunction to wrest control of the development from its current managing partner and 50% owner, Maurice Mann, owner of New York property firm Mann Realty. Legal papers filed by a unit of Mr. Leviev's Israel-based company, <span class="companylink">Africa Israel Investments Ltd</span>., charge Mr. Mann has "run amok as manager" of the project, spending operations money on his personal legal fees and allowing employees to live in the Apthorp's vacant apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Theodore Steingut, Mr. Mann's attorney, declined to comment on the injunction because he hadn't seen it. But he said "sniping" from Africa Israel had made the project's management more difficult, and that many of Africa Israel's claims are in error.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the former Times building, vacated when the newspaper moved to a new development nearby, remains largely unleased even though the building's renovation is complete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Leviev is one of Israel's richest and most famous entrepreneurs. A Russian emigrant, he built a diamond distribution empire second only to <span class="companylink">De Beers</span>, according to his company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this year, Mr. Leviev's leverage has hurt him. Africa Israel shares have fallen more than 80% in the past year and plummeted 20% in the past month alone, to $4.25 Tuesday on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. In the fall, Africa Israel announced a $475 million third-quarter loss because of falling real-estate values, mainly in Russia, and sold several of its New York assets to pay down debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These included half its stake in the Times building, which an unnamed investor is buying for $50 million plus an assumption of half the building's $720 million debt. Mr. Leviev paid $525 million for the 780,000-square-foot landmarked building in 2007, triple what the <span class="companylink">New York Times Co</span>. had sold it for just three years earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 16-story building recently completed a $200 million renovation, according to a person briefed on the project. All floors are listed as available on its Web site, and some Midtown Manhattan office-leasing brokers said they hadn't heard of any deals. The Times building's leasing agents at <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span> declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Apthorp's troubles appear to be a combination of the collapsing market and internal strife. In March 2007, Mr. Leviev and Mann Realty paid $426 million for the residence. With 163 units, it was built in 1908, and former residents have included Conan O'Brien, Cyndi Lauper and Rosie O'Donnell. At the time, some of the units were renting for more than $20,000 a month, but the new owners decided to convert the building to condos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conversion proceeded with Mr. Mann as the managing partner. Anglo Irish Bank Corp. provided a $385 million loan and <span class="companylink">Apollo Real Estate Advisors LP</span> gave a $135 million mezzanine loan to purchase, renovate and market the development. Last summer, the developers began offering condos at nearly $3,000 a square foot, placing the building's sell-out value at approximately $1 billion. But as the real-estate market plummeted, Apollo began objecting to the project's budget, saying its business plan no longer made sense because of falling prices and cost overruns. In August, Apollo made a capital call of $12 million to bring its loan back in balance. It was paid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first week of December, Apollo made another $22.7 million capital call. Apthorp's management, controlled by Mr. Mann, responded with a $500 million lawsuit, claiming the repayment request was an improper "ransom" payment and accusing Apollo of trying to take over the Apthorp at a bargain price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mann quickly dropped the suit, but it infuriated Mr. Leviev, who moved to oust Mann Realty as manager. On Friday, Mr. Leviev filed a request for an emergency injunction in New York Supreme Court demanding that Mr. Mann submit to an arbitration proceeding to choose a new third-party manager for the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Leviev alleges in court documents that Mann Realty's "woeful mismanagement has jeopardized the viability of the entire project, putting the loans in serious danger of imminent default."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Jan. 9, Apollo may declare the loan in default, according to Mr. Leviev's attorney, Y. David Scharf. "The project could be brought to a grinding half," he said. Apollo declined to comment. Meanwhile, the Apthorp has cut prices. The condos are being offered at an average price of roughly $2,150 per square foot, according to listing aggregator StreetEasy.com.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Recession, Tight Credit Compound Housing Woes; Data Show Sales of New and Existing Homes Plunge, as Do Prices; Coming Foreclosures Likely to Add to Inventory Overhang</span>
</div><div class="author">By Sudeep Reddy </div><div>772 words</div><div>24 December 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Real Estate; A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2008 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A deepening recession and tight credit conditions are compounding problems in the housing market, suggesting that declines in home prices may continue well into 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes tumbled 8.6% in November from the prior month to an annual pace of 4.49 million units, the National Association of Realtors said. The figure reflects contract closings, which lag behind sales activity, and as a result capture the credit-market turmoil that hit the economy starting in mid-September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales declined 2.9% to an annual rate of 407,000 units, the Commerce Department said, continuing a nearly three-year decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing sector has been hit hard throughout the year by an oversupply of homes that gradually forced high prices to fall. Tumbling prices, in turn, hurt the overall economy by battering financial institutions, reducing the wealth of homeowners and prompting job cuts in the housing sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the worsening recession is further damaging the housing market. Consumers who lose their jobs are adding to homeowner defaults, pushing forecasts for when the sector will hit bottom into the second half of 2009 or later. Until the housing market turns around, the overall economy is unlikely to grow much. Economists call this cycle an adverse feedback loop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What will be a significant number of foreclosures over coming quarters will only add to the inventory overhang and keep downward pressure on house prices," said Richard Moody, chief economist at real-estate firm Mission Residential, which expects prices to stop falling in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is one glimmer of good news not reflected in the latest figures: a sharp drop in mortgage rates in recent weeks tied to the federal government's efforts to support the housing market. Though tighter credit terms are restricting many potential borrowers, lower rates could pull some potential buyers off the sidelines and slow the price declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A broad measure of home values by the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span>, released Tuesday, showed prices nationwide dropping 1.1% in October from the prior month and 7.5% from a year earlier. The agency's index, built on purchase prices of houses backing mortgages sold to or guaranteed by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, is down 8.8% from its April 2007 peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors group said the median sale price of an existing home declined to $181,300 in November, down 13.2% from a year earlier. That is the largest drop in the four-decade history of the survey and likely the sharpest decline since the Depression. The group estimates that 45% of existing-home sales are linked to foreclosures. The inventory of unsold existing homes rose 0.1% to 4.2 million in November, representing an 11.2-month supply, up from 10.3 months in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department's sales figures showed the median price of a new home at $220,400 in November, down 11.5% from a year earlier. The average price declined 9.2% to $287,500. The inventory of unsold new homes declined 7% to 374,000 at the end of November. That represents 11.5 months of supply at the current pace, down from 11.8 months in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home-building activity has declined so much that the backlog of unsold units is starting to be absorbed at a fairly rapid clip even in the face of such a slow sales environment," said <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> economist David Greenlaw, who added that inventories won't drop to "manageable levels" for six to nine months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Commerce Department left its estimate of gross domestic product unrevised to show an annualized decline of 0.5% in the third quarter. Economists' forecasts have the economy declining at a pace of 4% to 6% in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The University of Michigan's final December reading of consumer sentiment edged up slightly to 60.1 from 59.1 earlier in the month. It has improved from its 55.3 reading in November largely due to continued declines in gasoline prices. But the figure is expected to remain relatively low due to the weakening job market and tumbling stock values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the survey, consumers' expectations for annual inflation declined to 1.7% from 2.9% in November. Over a five-year horizon -- a figure closely watched by Federal Reserve policy makers -- the expected pace of inflation slowed to 2.6% from 2.9%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the globe this December, funds that invest government money have been among the few buyers of big-ticket properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, cash-strapped U.S. warehouse giant <span class="companylink">ProLogis</span> announced it would sell many of its Asian assets for $1.3 billion to affiliates of <span class="companylink">GIC Real Estate</span>, Singapore's government-owned real-estate investment company. And earlier this month, the Libyan Investment Authority closed a $176 million deal to acquire an office building in London, according to research firm <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is foreign money ready to lead the way back into real estate?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Raymond Torto, chief economist at commercial brokerage <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>, says he is talking to "a whole bunch of folks" who are seeking to allocate billions more to real estate. He mentioned one Mexican investor prepared to commit as much as $3 billion in cash to real estate around the world. Of course there's no guarantee foreign investors -- most of whom have their own problems -- will start buying U.S. property anytime soon.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Providence Place for Sale</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beleaguered mall owner <span class="companylink">General Growth Properties Inc</span>. has put another top asset on the block to help it pare its $27 billion debt load: Providence Place in Providence, R.I.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upscale mall, located in downtown Providence across the street from the Rhode Island Convention Center, registers hardy sales per square foot of $560 and occupancy of more than 96%. It is being marketed by New York brokerage Savills Granite LLC. It is one of at least 10 malls General Growth is trying to sell as it negotiates with lenders to extend debt-payment deadlines. Finding a buyer in this capital-scarce market will be challenging. "It's a solid property, as many on the market are right now," said Greg Maloney, chief executive of <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>'s U.S. retail division. "Once capital frees up and we can determine the cost of capital, then we will see properties start to trade."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial Expansion</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having survived the residential-mortgage crunch, <span class="companylink">Annaly Capital Management Inc</span>. is looking to expand into the down-on-its-luck commercial-property-debt market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mortgage real-estate investment trust was one of the most conservative -- and successful -- when it came to investing in residential-mortgage securities, using relatively low leverage and avoiding toxic subprime assets. Most REITs specializing in residential mortgages have been clobbered by the credit-market crisis. Annaly invests in federal-agency-guaranteed securities backed by home loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the New York firm's investment advisory unit, Fidac, is exploring raising capital to invest in debt used to finance office towers, shopping malls, hotels and other types of commercial property. "There will be more stress on real estate, but we believe we have the ability to harvest value from the situations," says Kevin J. Riordan, who was hired by Annaly to lead the initiative. He is the former head of commercial-mortgage securities for <span class="companylink">TIAA-CREF</span>, the largest U.S. retirement system.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of both new and existing homes in the U.S. tumbled in November, and prices continued to fall, as a plunging stock market and a sharply deteriorating economy drove consumers out of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes, which include single-family homes and condos, fell 8.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.49 million units in November, a 10.6% drop from a year ago, the National Association of Realtors reported Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, sales of existing single-family homes plunged 8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.02 million in November, representing the lowest sales activity since July 1997.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national median home price fell to $181,300, a decline of 13.2% from a year ago, and the largest drop since the trade group began its survey in 1968. Lawrence Yun, the trade group's chief economist, said it was likely the largest decline since the Great Depression.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The total inventory of unsold homes rose 0.1% to 4.2 million in November, the highest since the 1980s. This represents a supply of 11.2 months, up from 10.3 months in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yun attributed the weakness to the softening economy and the stock-market plunge last month. He argued that Congress should act to shore up home prices by providing tax incentives to home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales fell a fourth time in a row during November, and prices remained below year-earlier levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of single-family homes decreased 2.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 407,000, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. October new-home sales fell 5.2% to an annual rate of 419,000; originally, the government said October sales retreated 5.3% to 433,000. Sales fell 1.3% in September and 11.3% in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had called for a 4.2% drop in November sales to a 415,000 annual rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales were 35.3% lower than the level in November 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce report showed there were an estimated 374,000 homes for sale at the end of November, representing 11.5 months' supply at the current sales rate. In October, an estimated 402,000 were for sale, an 11.8-month inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a new home plunged 11.5% to $220,400 in November from $249,100 in November 2007. The average price decreased 9.2% to $287,500 from $316,800 a year earlier. In October this year, the median price was $214,600 and the average was $279,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regionally last month, new-home sales fell 7.1% in the South and 16.4% in the Midwest. Sales rose 11.0% in the West and 14.3% in the Northeast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An estimated 28,000 homes were actually sold in November, down from 33,000 in October, based on figures not seasonally adjusted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the U.S. government left its estimate for the summer's economic deterioration unchanged, according to data Tuesday that exceeded the expectations of Wall Street analysts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gross domestic product fell at a 0.5% annual rate July through September, the Commerce Department reported. That was the same rate reported a month earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GDP is a measure of all goods and services produced in the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street had expected a slight downward adjustment to third-quarter GDP; economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires saw a revised decline of 0.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 0.5% slide in third-quarter GDP marked the biggest decrease since a 1.4% decline in the third quarter of 2001. Economists think that GDP in the current quarter fell far deeper, perhaps by as much as 6%. The first government estimate for GDP in that period, which ends next week, is due to be released in about a month. The rule of thumb is the economy is in recession when GDP declines for two consecutive quarters. But the National Bureau of Economic Research has already declared recession. The nonprofit group of academics monitors the U.S. business cycle and announced this month that a recession began a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gauges measuring third-quarter price inflation were adjusted to show that prices didn't rise as much as earlier thought, according to Tuesday's data revisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corporate profits after taxes were revised a bit lower. After-tax earnings fell 3.2% to $1.3 trillion in July through September from the second quarter, the report showed. Profits previously were estimated falling 3%. Second-quarter earnings decreased 0.4%. Year over year, profits fell 10.1% since the third quarter of 2007.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just when it seemed nearer, the housing recovery has darted away again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday the National Association of Realtors reports November home resales and the Commerce Department reports November new-home sales. Economists expect both measures fell during a month when economic activity generally came to a screeching halt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home resales, the bulk of the market, had seemed to stabilize this fall. But that was largely because of brisk foreclosure sales in stressed markets. And this thin silver lining has dimmed: Pending home sales, a leading resale indicator, have fallen for two months in a row after rising to their 2008 peak this summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A nagging oversupply of houses and record-low home-builder confidence suggest new-home sales won't perk up soon, either. There are hopeful signs for housing, critical to the health of the broader economy. Years of falling prices have made houses intriguingly affordable, especially relative to rising rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And mortgage rates have tumbled to their lowest levels in nearly 40 years. <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span> economists estimate that, since 1975, one percentage point of falling borrowing costs has added 15% to home sales and 1.5% to home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They warn, however, that those results depended on financial markets functioning "more or less normally." Not so now. With credit still tight, unemployment rising and household balance sheets still debt-heavy, lower rates have so far mainly produced more refinancings, not sales. Slashing rates to 4.5% for new borrowers, as the government aims to do, won't be a panacea, either. Ivy Zelman, chief executive of housing-research firm Zelman &amp;Associates, estimates that, even with such a low rate, only about 67% of U.S. households can afford a house. Homeownership was nearly 68% in the third quarter, according to the Census Bureau, implying there is virtually no untapped demand for homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Card Firm Has Tidings; Comfort, Joy Doubtful</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't expect much cheer in the card <span class="companylink">American Greetings</span> is sending to investors this holiday season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The greeting-cards firm reports third-quarter results Tuesday, and if the past two quarters are any indication, the numbers could be as bleak as today's national psyche. In the first two quarters of the current fiscal year, the firm missed analysts' estimates by more than 50%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only two analysts have published estimates for the third quarter, and they expect <span class="companylink">American Greetings</span> will earn, on average, 52 cents a share -- though the range is exceedingly wide at 44 cents to 60 cents. A year ago, <span class="companylink">American Greetings</span> earned 53 cents a share. Just where the numbers land will depend partly on cost-savings initiatives the company announced earlier this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts have trimmed revenue and earnings forecasts through fiscal 2010. Moreover, in recent reports both Stein Research and Gabelli &amp;Co. expressed concern dysfunctional credit markets might have mucked up the company's $195 million sale of its Care Bears and Strawberry Shortcake properties, which was supposed to close in September but still hasn't. Analysts will seek guidance on that as well.</p>
