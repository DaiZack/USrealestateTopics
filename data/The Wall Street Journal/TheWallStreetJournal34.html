</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos </div><div>647 words</div><div>6 April 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A5</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartment rents rose during the first quarter, ending five straight quarters of declines and signaling the worst may be over for the hard-hit sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, the apartment vacancy rate stayed flat at 8%, the highest level since <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>., a New York research firm, began its tally in 1980.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reis tracks vacancies and rents in the top 79 U.S. markets, and rents rose in 60 of them, led by Miami, Seattle and New York -- all cities that have notched big rental declines in the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rents increased 1.6% in the first quarter in Miami and 0.9% in New York. The gains came during what is usually a seasonally weak period for apartments and suggested that landlords may have some momentum heading into the peak spring and summer leasing season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Deterioration seems not to have just been arrested but reversed," said Victor Calanog, director of research for Reis. "Several markets have bottomed and may be on track to recovery," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, effective rents, which include concessions such as one month of free rent, rose 0.3% during the quarter compared with a 0.7% decline in the fourth quarter of last year and a 1.1% drop in the first quarter of 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vacancies are tied to unemployment, because many would-be renters move in with family members or double up during a downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We clearly hit an inflection point in all of our markets in January and February," said Jeffrey Friedman, chief executive of <span class="companylink">Associated Estates Realty Corp</span>., which owns and operates 12,000 units in the eastern U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renters are also staying put longer: the average renter now stays for 19 months, up from an average of 14 months, said Mr. Friedman, and despite low mortgage rates and greater home affordability, fewer renters are leaving to buy homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is the first time in many, many years that it feels like even people who could afford to buy are making the investment decision not to," Mr. Friedman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Difficulty in obtaining financing for new apartment construction, meanwhile, has limited the supply of new units that will be added in the coming years. Those fundamentals have landlords and investors excited about the potential for rents to pop once the economy gathers steam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Calanog said that a "slow recovery" was likely and that landlords shouldn't expect "galloping rental growth" until the job market firms up, particularly because younger workers that are more likely to rent have borne the brunt of job losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others warned that gains were fragile and that landlords could continue to offer concessions to fill units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Rent reductions are not over yet," said Hessam Nadji, managing director at real-estate firm Marcus &amp;Millichap. He said he didn't expect to see sustained rental growth until the second half of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barely half of the 22,000 units in buildings that opened their doors last quarter were filled, and landlords may cut deals because they face deadlines to pay back construction loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That's where renters are going to find deals," Mr. Calanog said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Portland, Ore., posted the largest rent decline, at 0.7%, followed by Las Vegas, San Diego, and Southern California's Inland Empire. Those three markets have all seen an uptick in home-buying activity, particularly among the low end from first-time buyers and investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">South Florida, meanwhile, appears to show signs of stabilizing after a painful years-long slump prompted by heavy overbuilding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rents gained 1.1% last quarter in Palm Beach and 0.8% in Tampa-St. Petersburg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That market has been so bad for so long that many people had started to forget about it," said Alexander Goldfarb, an analyst at <span class="companylink">Sandler O'Neill &amp;Partners LP</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house at 10512 Baldy Mountain Rd. in Sandpoint, Idaho, looks like just another vacant foreclosed home. Some appliances, a bathroom mirror and even the hot tub are missing. The dining room of the three-bedroom house has water damage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this isn't your run-of-the-mill problem house. Call it an Extreme Foreclosure. The 3,678-square-foot McMansion is a product of the popular "Extreme Makeover: Home Edition" reality television show. It isn't the only "Extreme" home to fall on hard times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each week, an average 9.4 million viewers tune in to ABC-TV for what, over seven seasons, has become a classic formula: Find a struggling family with a heart-tugging story and send them on vacation as an army of volunteers work frantically to replace an existing home with a much nicer and bigger one in just 106 hours. Each episode ends with a dramatic tear-filled tour of the new home, packed with donated furnishings, and outsize extras like a carousel or bowling lanes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after the cameras have gone, another trend has been developing: Homeowners struggle to keep up with their expensive new digs. In many cases, the bigger, more lavish homes have come with bigger, more lavish utility bills. And bigger tax assessments. Some homeowners have tapped the equity of their super-sized homes only to fall behind on the higher mortgage payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The show's producers say they are aware of the problem and are making changes appropriate to current economic reality: downsizing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in the boom, the makeovers got a little out of hand because of competition among home builders aware of the free publicity that came with the show and who tried to outdo previous projects. These days, the show is backing away from the boom-era showpieces. We "scaled back," says Conrad Ricketts, an executive producer for the show created and produced by <span class="companylink">Endemol USA</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average size of current makeovers is 2,800 to 3,000 square feet. A 2005 episode featured Milton and Patricia Harper's house in Lake City, Ga., that became a 5,300-square-foot English castle boasting five bedrooms, seven bathrooms, five fireplaces and an outdoor kitchen. Later that season, Nichol Okvath's family got a 5,346-square-foot house in Gilbert, Ariz., with six bedrooms, a movie theater and a carousel in the backyard. These days, the houses appear more subdued, eschewing such over-the-top amenities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A swimming pool is no longer a must, unless it could be used for therapy. When pools are built, the show explores a well system to help reduce water usage and costs. Lavish landscaping is out, working with the local environment is in. "We're not going to New Mexico, the desert, and trying to put sod down," Mr. Ricketts says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tracy Hutson, an interior designer who has been with "Extreme Makeover" since the beginning, says homes are receiving more earth-friendly products, such as low water-flow toilets and solar panels, curbing the giant electricity bills that caused a hardship. "I think our hearts were in the right place, but we just got carried way," says Ms. Hutson. "It can be extreme without being the biggest house you've ever seen."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in 2003, the 59-year-old Mr. Ricketts, who has worked in movies and TV for nearly three decades, was looking to develop a home-remodeling series. As he traveled down a "nice street" in Santa Clarita, Calif., he came upon a broken-down house that didn't seem to fit in. He learned the family had a child battling leukemia, leaving little money for maintenance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I knew at that moment it was the soul of the TV show," Mr. Ricketts recalls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The California family's home was remodeled for the first episode airing later that year. But soon, remodeling gave way to razing and rebuilding houses, making for more dramatic TV during the housing boom. As the show became more popular, donations flowed and builders got more and more ambitious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has since become part of pop culture, and, while plenty of makeover shows have come and gone, it remains the most ambitious, well-known and generous of the genre. It's also important to ABC when it comes to ratings and selling ads: Among broadcast networks, the show ranks second in the key female demographics and tops with children ages 2 to 11.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Huber Engineered Woods LLC</span> has donated its premium floor, wall and roof products for 25 houses. While TV viewers don't always see the brand, "connecting with builders and framers on job sites" has led to increased awareness and additional sales, says Matt O'Brien, vice president of commercial operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many families featured on the program, the Extreme Makeover experience has been a dream come true. But for some, the experience has been financially stressful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several owners have sought loan modifications to reduce their payments to stay in their homes, lenders say. Some families seek a quick-fix by trying to sell. But because Extreme Makeovers tend to be big, fancy residences plopped into working-class or rural communities, the houses can be a hard sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house in Sandpoint, which was owned by Eric Hebert, appears to be the first Extreme Makeover home to actually fall into foreclosure, in October. Mr. Hebert did not answer requests for comment. But he told a local television station last year that "the biggest mistake I think that I made was I took too much money out on the house thinking that I was going to have a job, you know, in the future."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK — Small-capitalization stocks surged Monday, as data showing improvements in the labor and housing markets broadly strengthened confidence in riskier assets, sending both benchmark small-cap indexes to 18-month highs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks jumped 13.67 points, or 2%, to 697.65, its highest close since Sept. 26, 2008. The measure is up 12% this year and up nearly 56% over the past 52 weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> SmallCap 600 index climbed 6.81, or 1.9%, to 370.23, with all of its sectors in the black. The S&amp;P 600 also reached its highest close since Sept. 26, 2008. The measure is up 11% since Jan. 1 and up 57% over the past 52 weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the purposes of this column, small-caps are considered those companies with a market capitalization of less than $2 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small-caps, considered riskier because of their higher volatility and lower cash reserves, soared Monday, the first day of trading after the government reported Friday that nonfarm payrolls in March posted their biggest gain since March 2007. A brightening jobs market is particularly good news for smaller companies, said Jerry Harris, president and chief investment officer of Sterne Agee Asset Management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If a small company has 100 employees, they can increase their payrolls by 10% because they can find 10 people," Mr. Harris said. "Smaller companies are more agile and they can take advantage of opportunities quicker."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market, also a source of recent concern to investors, brightened on Monday after pending home sales unexpectedly rose by 8.2% in February, surprising economists who were expecting a modest decline. Small-cap home builders gained Monday, including <span class="companylink">Standard Pacific</span>, which gained 33 cents, or 7.4%, to $4.81. <span class="companylink">Beazer Homes USA</span> rose 31 cents, or 6.8%, to 4.88. Both are traded on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small-cap energy stocks soared Monday as crude-oil prices rose above $86 a barrel, settling at the highest level since October 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also boosting the sector, oil-and-gas exploration company <span class="companylink">SandRidge Energy</span> (NYSE) announced Sunday it is acquiring West Texas rival Arena Resources (NYSE) for $1.6 billion. Arena Resources climbed 2.45, or 7.2%, to 36.71, while SandRidge declined 27 cents, or 3.4%, to 7.58.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The top-performing small-cap energy stocks on Monday included <span class="companylink">Gulf Island Fabrication</span>, which makes offshore-drilling and production platforms, up 1.25, or 6%, to 22.02. Oil-and-gas company <span class="companylink">Swift Energy</span> (NYSE) climbed 1.39, or 4.3%, to 33.89.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Utilities posted the smallest gains on Monday. <span class="companylink">Piedmont Natural Gas</span> (NYSE), a natural-gas utility that serves customers in the Carolinas and Tennessee, rose seven cents, or 0.3%, to 27.61. Energy company Avista (NYSE) edged up six cents, or 0.3%, to 21.10.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among stocks in focus, oil refiner Tesoro (NYSE) tumbled 78 cents, or 5.4%, to 13.61, on the first day of trading since a blast killed five workers and injured two others at the San Antonio company's oil refinery north of Seattle. Over the weekend, federal and state agencies began investigating the Friday blast. At least two analysts downgraded the company in light of the deadliest incident in the company's history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientific business-software companies Accelrys and Symyx Technologies agreed to an all-stock merger of equals valued at about $176 million. Accelrys, based in San Diego, Calif., rose 51 cents, or 7.9%, to 7.01, while Symyx, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., climbed 99 cents, or 22%, to 5.46.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York biopharmaceutical company <span class="companylink">Keryx Biopharmaceuticals</span> and its Canada-based biotechnology partner, AEterna Zentaris, said the Food and Drug Administration plans to expedite its review of their colorectal cancer treatment perifosine. The fast-track designation typically speeds up the review of new drugs that have the potential to address unmet medical needs for serious conditions. A late-stage study on the drug is expected to begin this quarter. Keryx gained 61 cents, or 22%, to 3.35, while AEterna Zentaris climbed 15 cents, or 19%, to 95 cents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drug maker <span class="companylink">Auxilium Pharmaceuticals</span> jumped 3.30, or 11%, to 33.93, after several analysts reported that more than 550 doctors have been trained and registered to use the Malvern, Pa., company's Xiaflex hand-disorder treatment since its launch last month. Analysts said the 2010 consensus sales estimate of $45 million might be too low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Cirrus Logic</span>, which makes circuits for audio and energy-related applications, jumped 70 cents, or 8.3%, to 9.15, after technology firms determined the Austin, Texas, company supplied a chip for managing audio in Apple's new iPad, according to The Wall Street Journal. Firms that specialize in disassembling and analyzing electronic hardware began taking iPads apart shortly after the product went on sale Saturday morning to determine what companies provided components for the device. Cirrus has long been a supplier to Apple products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dental-laboratory operator National Dentex soared 6.81, or 68%, to 16.83 after agreeing to be acquired by GDC Holdings for about $96 million in cash. The Natick, Mass., company has until May 12 to solicit a better offer. National Dentex shareholders will get $17 a share, a 70% premium over the closing price of $10.02 from Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Women's apparel retailer Talbots (NYSE) climbed 13 cents, or 1%, to 13.71 after extending its offer to exchange BPW Acquisition (NYSE) warrants to Talbots's stock or warrants to 6 p.m. EDT Monday, as the number of warrants tendered are still slightly less than the minimum needed. Talbots, based in Hingham, Mass., plans to buy BPW, a Stamford, Conn., special-purpose acquisition company, but will surrender majority control to BPW to access its cash to pay down the bulk of Talbots's debt. Meanwhile, shares of BPW edged down 17 cents, or 1.3%, to 12.61.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil-and-gas exploration and development company <span class="companylink">Brigham Exploration</span> gained 84 cents, or 4.9%, to 17.96, after the Austin, Texas, company said it hit a record production rate at one of the 2,700 wells in the Williston Basin.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The service sector grew for the third consecutive month in March, according to a report, the latest indicator that the economic recovery is broadening to more businesses and industries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A gauge of pending home sales also ticked up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management, a group of corporate purchasing managers, on Monday said its gauge of economic activity in the non-manufacturing sector grew to 55.4 in March from 53 a month earlier. The index portrayed a broad-based recovery, with 14 of the 18 industries showing expansion. Two were flat and two contracted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any reading by the ISM Index over 50 shows growth and under that number indicates shrinkage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industries that showed growth in March included information, retail trade and finance. The only two industries to contract were real estate and educational services. The service sector accounts for about two-thirds of U.S. economic activity and most of employment, but until recently has lagged behind manufacturing in the recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It looks like the recovery is definitely here in the service sector," said Adam York, an economist with <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo Securities</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday's report showed a broad recovery across various sub-indexes. The largest growth came in new export orders, which grew 10.5 points to 57.5. Order backlogs grew 9.5 points to 55.5 and new orders grew 7.3 to 62.3. The only sub-indexes that showed contraction were supplier deliveries, at 49.5, and employment, at 49.8. The employment sub-index, just below the growth threshold, was up from 48.6 in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All indications are we're going to start seeing some job creation soon, but it's been slow," said Anthony Nieves, chair of the ISM's non-manufacturing Business Survey Committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the National Association of Realtors said Monday that its index of pending home sales increased to 97.6 from 90.2 in February. The index, which can be volatile due to a small sample size, shows homes that are in contract but not yet purchased. February's growth likely reflects a flurry of buyers looking to take advantage of the government's homebuyer tax credit that has been extended to contracts signed by April 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction spending fell for a fourth consecutive month in February, dragged lower by the sagging commercial real estate market and ongoing weakness in the housing market, the Commerce Department said last week. Stocks of several homebuilding companies including <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> rose on the positive pending home sales news.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite some signs of an improving economy, spending on new construction continued to decline in early 2010. The total value of construction spending was running at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $846.2 billion in February, down 1.3% from January and down 13% from February a year ago. Spending on residential construction was running at an annual rate of $258.5 billion in February, down 3.8% from a year earlier, while spending on nonresidential construction was $587.7 billion, down 16% from a year earlier.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Americans rushed to sign contracts for previously owned homes in February, signaling a fat tax credit might revive the housing market this spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Institute for Supply Management's purchasing managers' index for nonmanufacturing increased to 55.4 in March. That is better than 53 in February and 53.5 expected. The business activity subindex jumped to 60 from 54.8. The employment subindex rose to 49.8 from 48.6, but remains in contractionary territory. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite snowstorms and joblessness, the National Association of Realtors' index for pending sales of used homes rose by 8.2% to 97.6, the industry group said Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had expected pending home sales would decline in February by 0.5%. January pending home sales were revised slightly down, to 90.2 from an originally reported level of 90.4.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR index is based on pending sales of existing homes, including single-family homes and condominiums. A home sale is pending when the contract has been signed but the transaction hasn't closed. Pending sales typically close within one or two months of signing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unexpected increase raised spirits in the housing industry. Home resales had fallen three consecutive times, including a 0.6% drop in February that suggested fragility in the housing sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The rise in buyer contract activity may signal the early stages of a second surge of home sales this spring," NAR economist Lawrence Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government has enacted two tax credits over the past year to spur home buying. The second one is good through April, and sellers have been hoping for a spring rush.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But analysts caution sales could fall after the second credit expires. "A bottom has been reached in existing home sales and a recovery is under way, but it is being heavily underpinned by government stimulus," Insight Economics analyst Steven Wood said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Year over year, the NAR pending home sales index was 17.3% higher than its level of 83.2 in February 2009. The tax credit helped sales in 2009, as did low prices and mortgage rates that helped fight the headwinds of high unemployment and tight credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its monthly forecast on the industry, the NAR projected existing-home sales of 5.49 million this year and 5.7 million in 2011. That compares with 5.16 million in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for an existing home is seen at $177,200 in 2010 and $184,800 in 2011. It was $172,500 in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By region, pending sales in the Northeast rose 9% in February and were 18.9% higher than a year earlier. The Midwest rose 21.8% and was 18.7% higher than a year earlier. Pending sales in the South climbed 9.2% and were 17.5% above February 2009. The West fell 4.8% but was 14.6% higher than the prior year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's said that the smell of pepper can throw bloodhounds off a trail. Is the unpleasant scent from the U.S. housing market similarly leading policy makers astray?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market, typically one of the first sectors to rebound after recessions, still looks perilously weak. On Monday, the National Association of Realtors is expected to say pending home sales, which measure contracts signed but not yet closed, fell another 0.5% in February after a 7.6% drop the prior month. Amid high foreclosure rates and sluggish sales, a glut of inventory threatens to renew downward pressure on home prices, already off by some 30% from their peak. Officials are understandably wary of a housing-market double-dip. The market's initial collapse not only damaged household wealth but also delivered a near-fatal blow to the financial system, which ultimately resulted in the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the more that other pillars of the U.S. economy—manufacturing, consumer spending, business investment and even hiring—show improvement, the more the outsize concern about the housing market seems a bit misplaced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market may not be nearly as weak as is commonly assumed. Activity is down sharply from the boom, but that is arguably a positive development. Total sales, as of February, were running just about 10% below their long-run average, according to <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> economist Michael Feroli. In addition, foreclosure- mitigation programs and an overtaxed court system are likely to keep inventory from immediately flooding the market. St. Louis-based <span class="companylink">Macroeconomic Advisers</span> expects a steady rebound in home-building from its current depressed levels will add nearly a percentage-point to U.S. economic growth this year and next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if the worst-case scenario does start to unfold—supply soars while demand stagnates and prices move down further—it isn't clear that would be a disaster. With interest and mortgage rates already inching higher, falling prices would keep housing affordable for new buyers. Price declines pose a risk to banks' profitability, but last year's stress tests boosted capital requirements precisely to account for such a scenario. A negative-wealth effect could hamper consumer spending, but the rebounding stock market has already boosted household wealth by some $5 trillion from its trough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In short, the odds of a stronger recovery now seem at least as likely as the odds of a weaker one. Fed officials remain confident they can quickly outrun any breakout of inflationary pressures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's hope the hound dogs have their nose on the right trail.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to house hunting, Kim Sliney is the first to admit she can be picky. The 46-year-old interior designer just couldn't see herself living in small, chopped-up rooms. Or being happy in boxy interiors adorned with blah bathroom tiles and Formica counters. After visiting—and vetoing—37 houses, the single mom from Exeter, R.I., happened upon her just-right fit: a newly built, $350,000 home that boasted a spacious-feeling layout, killer walk-in closets and custom details like crown molding, granite countertops and a gas fireplace—for no extra charge. How did she stumble into this particular development? She was driving around in the area and saw a woman-centric sign on the entrance. "It was very intriguing," says Ms. Sliney.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Men may think they run the world, but it's women who are now getting the royal treatment from the housing industry. Indeed, say housing market watchers, builders are now strenuously working to win the hearts—and checkbooks—of female buyers. And with the economy punishing the sexes unevenly, single women have become an especially important force to be reckoned with in real estate. According to the National Association of Realtors, they now sign on the dotted line in nearly a quarter of all U.S. home deals—up from 14% in 1995.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To tap into this formidable market, more industry pros are touting themselves as "certified" in women's housing needs. Design Basics, an Omaha outfit that trains and certifies "woman-centric" builders, says its roster of participating firms has more than quadrupled, to 70, in the four years since it launched the program. Developers nationwide increasingly trumpet home features to address what they believe women want—think security (more), maintenance (less), and organizing hectic lives with amenities like walk-in pantries and "drop zones" for groceries. Builders are trying to catch women's eyes with carefully chosen aesthetic flourishes—right down to brass cabinet knobs—so often invisible to Joe "Where do I put the plasma?" Guy Buyer. And sales teams are exploring selling tactics like paint-color psychology and spa nights, while doing everything they can to reduce the intimidation factor of the purchase process for solo women buyers. Home-marketing consultant Sara Lamia summed up the industry's growing fixation on females when she addressed a gathering at this year's International Builders' Show: "If Mama ain't happy, you're dead in the water."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To critics, of course, the idea that new homes are more Mama-friendly is just marketing hooey from an industry starved for sales. And even woman-centric builders acknowledge that men are just as likely as women to crave roomy closets or sleek countertops. "Much of what we propose is smart design," admits Design Basics exec Paul Foresman. But hype-driven or not, the wooing of the XX-chromosome crew is the by-product of genuine demographic and social trends. Women are tying the knot later, pursuing more higher degrees and continuing to close the salary gap, with never-married women now earning 94% of what their single male counterparts do. Fewer women are "waiting for Mr. Right to build a nest egg," says Linda Hebert, trustee of the National Association of Home Builders Professional Women in Building Council; small wonder that they're not waiting to nest, either.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ironically, the beleaguered economy that the housing bubble created may be giving women, particularly younger ones, their biggest shot at homeownership. In the current malaise, people working in the financial and manufacturing sectors—mostly men—took it on the chin first; in 2008 alone, more men than women lost their jobs by a ratio of three to one. And in a housing market where depressed prices are creating bargains, twenty- and thirtysomething females see their chance to build equity. Ellen Iggulden, a 27-year-old Chicago-based auditor, says most of her guy friends are sitting on the buying sidelines. But among her female college pals, she was actually one of the last to take the real estate plunge. Hearing about their successes, she says, was empowering: "If they can do it, I can."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with more single women diving into the home-buying pool, real estate experts say understanding and meeting their needs takes work. Design Basics says it's making a concerted effort to study what women want, through focus groups and in-home observation. Builders seeking to be certified as woman-centric by the firm sit through a two-day seminar, are showered with newsletters and white-paper research, and are coached on how to retool their blueprints and marketing plans. Ultimately, for a fee of as much as $10,000 annually, they're allowed to stamp their Web sites and e-mail signatures with the firm's woman-centric seal. Some of the program's suggested feminine features? Wall-mounted gift-wrapping stations with retractable shelves, "serenity packages" (up to $5,000 extra) that include noise-muffling walls to drown out upstairs laundry machines, and hidden storage in the bathroom walls for on-the-john reading materials and feminine products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In her hunt for a townhouse under $280,000 in the Dallas area, Sharon Cherrnay has found herself drawn to "feminine" details like hairdryer-ready drawers (plug included) and 360- degree mirrors. But while the 54-year-old real estate professional appreciates thoughtful amenities, her top priority isn't seeing the back of her hair; like the majority of single female homebuyers, it's security, so she's focusing on gated communities. She's hoping to find a walkable, convenient neighborhood. She'd like the design to have a bit of "romance" to it, she says, but as is the case with many women, she's avoiding fixer-uppers. "I don't like the pre-owned feel," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-buying among women such as Ms. Cherrnay is actually a relatively new phenomenon. Barely a generation ago, an American female couldn't get a mortgage without a male cosigner. That changed as divorce rates soared, prompting the passage of equal-lending laws. Today women make up about 21% of borrowers, up from 17% in 1998. But that number doesn't accurately reflect the homeownership rolls. As courts grant women more favorable divorce settlements than in the past—in some cases up to 70% of marital assets—they're receiving the keys to the family house, or the means to find a new one. Rhode Island designer Kim Sliney, for one, didn't need a mortgage, she says, because she used a portion of her divorce settlement to pay for her new home outright.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single female homebuyers have also received something of an advantage from the recession, which has punished male-dominated industries disproportionately. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of female payroll employees fell by 2.6 million in 2008 and 2009, compared with 5.8 million for men. Indeed, last year marked the first time that women outnumbered men on the country's payrolls—a milestone that University of Chicago economist Casey Mulligan attributes to the downturn. Historically, he says, the majority of women's employment gains have occurred in recessions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such recent empowerment is a big reason some beleaguered builders see women as key to their industry's recovery. According to the National Association of Home Builders, single-family home sales are projected to rise 28% this year compared with 2009, prompting some novel and sometimes dubious-sounding marketing ideas aimed at the ladies. Woman-centric gimmicks range from massages and yoga to cooking demonstrations and jewelry-design parties. Mark Patterson, a builder in Maine, is considering holding an educational session on menopause to draw more women to his development, complete with a comedian to keep the event light. The industry is even looking to hook women in normally guy-heavy arenas like the World Series. Last year, Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate, betting that some females in attendance would get bored with the game, placed an ad in the World Series program, inviting women to view "staging to sell" videos on their cellphones. The ad caused such a surge in site traffic, the company says, that it's considering similar pitches for football games and Nascar races.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, homeownership for single women isn't exactly a swing in the backyard hammock. Although women have made gains on the mortgage front—their rejection rates dropped from 37% in 1998 to 23% in 2008—postcrash loans have been much tougher to land for one-income applicants. And a recent study in the Journal of Real Estate Finance and Economics shows that women tend to pay more for mortgages than men because they're more likely to choose lenders through word-of-mouth recommendations. "Men will search for the lowest rate, while women rely on others," says coauthor Zhenguo Lin, a real estate professor at Mississippi State University. What's more, research shows women are 32% more likely than men to receive subprime mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there's the adventure of home maintenance. To be sure, some single women don't think twice about fixing a leaky faucet or even installing new floors, but real estate agents say women are more likely than men to prefer not to deal with the upkeep. When Lindsay Griffiths' sump pump failed, causing water to drench her heater, the 30-year-old Barnegat, N.J., legal marketer crawled under the house with a flashlight and mucked around in 18 inches of dirty, cold water to assess the cause before calling her parents at midnight, in tears. "I was kicking myself for not paying attention during the home inspection," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And home hassles aside, skeptics say some of the marketing flurry around women is half-baked. Part of the problem, says Scott Testa, a marketing professor at Cabrini College, is that the real estate industry has been a late adopter of modern marketing techniques. Its fairly recent desire to learn what customers want simply leads to better design—like kitchens opening up into family rooms—which isn't necessarily woman-centric. "More people like open design," Mr. Testa says. "Whether that's a woman preference, I don't know that as a fact."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With so many builders drinking the girl-power Kool-Aid, Greg Brown, for one, decided to take action. The Seattle-based developer started a business to fight what he sees as women's hold over every detail in the home, right down to the size and shape of the toilet handle. "We'll go into a house, and a guy will say, 'Well, I don't know if she'll let me have that,'" Mr. Brown says. "Most guys are weenies who don't stand up for anything anymore." His solution: Stoke the male mojo by building "man caves." One of his current projects (price tag: $15,000) combines must-have boy toys like a kegerator, an Xbox 360 game system and 52-inch LCD TV, along with dude-friendly decor including a "chandelier" made out of golf clubs. The finishing touch? A certified man cave imprint burned into the side of the bar. Apparently women aren't the only ones being sold a seal of approval.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: My wife and I want to sell the four-bedroom home she owns in Suisun City, Calif. She refinanced it in 2006 for $310,000, but it's only worth $180,000 now. We want to sell it to get rid of the financial burden, so my wife can quit her job and we can start a family. But we can't do it without a short sale. We have a good tenant renting the place right now who may want to purchase it. What should we do?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">West Sacramento, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: A short sale is the quickest way out of your dilemma, but it will wreck your wife's credit for years to come. Given that she will be out of the work force, limiting her ability to rebuild her credit, I'd consider this only as a last resort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, look into these other options:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider a loan modification. Because this home is now an investment property, and not your primary home, it won't qualify for any refinancing programs sponsored by the federal government. Still, your lender might be willing to restructure your loan. An attorney can advise you on the best way to broach the issue. The attorney can review your loan's documentation to see if it fully complies with the Real Estate Settlement and Procedures Act–a federal law designed to prevent kickbacks and promote ethical lending practices. If the loan isn't in compliance, your attorney will be able to argue that the loan is void, and will be in a good position to negotiate a reduction of your principal and/or interest (you may also be due a refund of your original closing costs).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wait for the real estate market to recover. According to <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span>, home prices in Suisun City have indeed taken a steep hit since their mid-2000 highs, and dropped almost 15% in January 2010 from a year earlier. But home prices in the city have always been volatile—they rose 131.5% between 2000 and 2005—and at some point, perhaps soon, the bottom will be reached and prices will recover. In fact, the most recent statistics are encouraging: <span class="companylink">Yahoo.com</span>'s research shows prices for Suisun City homes that are not in foreclosure actually rose 6.1% in March 2010 from the month before. And while there are still more than 170 bank-owned properties in the city, according to RealtyTrac.com, local officials have rolled out a first-time buyer program  [http://www.suisun.com/EconDev/1stTimeHomeBuyer.html] that subsidizes loans for certain foreclosed homes. That should reduce some of the foreclosed inventory, and prop up prices of all homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Talk to your tenant. Usually, I'm a big fan of rent-to-own deals, but since your property is only worth 58% of what you owe, I doubt you could negotiate a sales price and terms that would recoup all or most of your debt. But you never know. If your tenant has blemished credit, loves your house and wants to rent for four or five years before buying (when prices are sure to be higher), you might be able to come to an understanding. Such a deal would ensure that your property is kept in good condition, and it would spare you real estate broker fees when the property is sold.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sarah N. Lynch                And Luca Di Leo   </div><div>905 words</div><div>1 April 2010</div><div>10:48</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of workers filing new claims for jobless benefits continued to fall last week, bolstering expectations that claims appear to be back on a clear downward trend as the labor market slowly heals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, U.S. construction spending dropped a fourth consecutive month in February. Separately, the Institute of Supply Management's manufacturing index posted a strong gain for March, rising to 59.6 from 56.5 a month earlier. The March number was the strongest since July 2004. Readings above 50 indicate expansion. Prices and inventories showed the strongest expansion, while the employment subindex ticked down. New orders and production were both up modestly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department said in its weekly report Thursday that initial claims for jobless benefits declined by 6,000 to 439,000 in the week ended March 27. The previous week's level was revised upward to 445,000 from 442,000. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires expected initial claims to decrease by 2,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four-week moving average, which aims to smooth volatility in the data to help paint a better picture of the underlying trend, fell to the lowest level since Sept. 13, 2008 for the week ending March 27. The Labor Department said the four-week moving average went down by 6,750 to 447,250 from the previous week's revised average of 454,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total claims lasting more than one week, meanwhile, declined to levels last seen in December 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest decline in jobless claims falls in line with economists' expectations that claims are finally back on a downward path after being stuck in a lull since the beginning of the year. Even if unemployment figures start to show some improvement, however, economists and other experts also don't expect to see major gains in labor market conditions for 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forecasters are expecting the national 9.7% unemployment rate in Friday's monthly jobs report to hold steady, suggesting the pace of new hiring is still slow. And any gains that may be shown in the March job figures may not suggest a full turnaround since some of it may be driven by temporary things like government hiring for the Census.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, a report this week by <span class="companylink">Automatic Data Processing Inc</span>. and consultancy firm <span class="companylink">Macroeconomic Advisers</span> actually reported an unexpected 23,000 decline in private-sector jobs when forecasters surveyed by Dow Jones had expected to see a 50,000 gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a response to the unemployment situation, the Obama administration recently unveiled a series of expansions to foreclosure prevention programs that target in part unemployed Americans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One program, known as the Home Affordable Modification Program or HAMP, would let unemployed homeowners that meet certain criteria temporarily reduce their mortgage payments to an affordable level while they look for work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress has also sought to respond to the jobs crisis with several legislative packages. One bill, which was passed recently by the U.S. Senate, would provide tax credits to workers who hire the unemployed. Another proposal still in the works is a bill to provide tax credits to small businesses. That proposal was approved by the U.S. House, but still must be voted on by the Senate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Labor Department's Thursday report, the number of continuing claims -- those drawn by workers for more than one week in the week ended March 20 -- decreased by 6,000 to 4,662,000 from the preceding week's revised level of 4,668,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unemployment rate for workers with unemployment insurance for the week ended March 20 was 3.6% -- unchanged from the prior week's rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The largest increase in initial claims for the week ended March 20 occurred in Illinois due to layoffs in the construction, trade, and manufacturing sectors. The largest decrease in claims occurred in California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction Spending Fall Again</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. construction spending dropped a fourth consecutive month in February, dragged lower by a sagging commercial real estate market and a weak housing sector that are restraining the economy's recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending decreased by 1.3% in February, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $846.23 billion compared to the prior month, the Commerce Department said Thursday. January spending was revised down, falling 1.4% instead of 0.6% as previously estimated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending fell 3.4% in December and 2.5% in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 1.3% decrease in February matched the forecast of economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending on residential construction in February slid 2.1% to $258.49 billion, after rising 0.7% in January. Groundbreaking on houses is down because of slack demand for new homes. Buyers brave enough to ignore high unemployment in the U.S. are taking advantage of low interest rates and signing contracts for cheaper used homes, which are a better deal because of the wave of foreclosures in the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending on non-residential projects decreased 1.0%. Outlays dropped for hotels, hospitals, schools, churches, and roads. Office construction spending fell 2.6% and commercial spending dropped 3.2%. Vacancy rates are rising and loans for building are difficult to secure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By sector, private construction spending during February decreased by 1.2% to $553.49 billion. Spending was down 1.7% in January. Public-sector spending decreased in February 1.7% to $292.74 billion.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Dan Fitzpatrick   </div><div>1320 words</div><div>31 March 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DESTIN, Fla.— Early last decade <span class="companylink">Regions Financial Corp</span>. financed an 11-story condominium complex in one of the nation's hottest real-estate markets, the sugary-white sliver of Florida beachfront known as the "Redneck Riviera."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dowd Ritter, the man who would soon run Birmingham, Ala.-based Regions, believed so much in the area's potential that he and his wife bought three units inside the new condo complex and four units in another nearby tower overlooking the Gulf of Mexico, and signed a contract for two more in a third tower. All told, the couple agreed to pay about $7.5 million to buy seven condos from 1999 to 2004, becoming part of the real-estate frenzy that gripped the southeastern U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The interests of the bank and its chief executive converged during the financial crisis, leaving both exposed to one of the nation's worst real-estate markets. Regions, the country's 12th-biggest bank, has lost a combined $6.63 billion over the past two years and still hasn't received approval to pay back $3.5 billion in public support from the U.S. Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program, making it one of the few banks of its size still dependent on government support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 62-year-old Mr. Ritter is scheduled to step down Wednesday as Regions's CEO, although he will remain as a consultant to the company for as many as five years. When Regions announced last December that Mr. Ritter would be leaving, Mr. Ritter said in a release that it was "an appropriate time to retire" and that Regions "is performing well despite the economic downturn."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His successor is former president Grayson Hall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ritter became Regions's CEO in 2006 after leading a merger with crosstown rival AmSouth Bancorp, where he had been CEO since 1996. All of the Florida properties were purchased in the name of Mr. Ritter's wife, Susan, while Mr. Ritter was the CEO of AmSouth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple still owns three condos in the area that they bought for a combined $4.1 million. The Ritters use the properties as vacation getaways, said a person familiar with the family's use of the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Mr. Ritter and the bank both made bets on the area's property market, there is no evidence Mr. Ritter did anything wrong in his purchases or sales of the properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Regions bank spokesman said Mr. Ritter was unavailable to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ritters netted about $195,000 on their investments via the sale of four condo properties. But the last two sold in 2008 for roughly $400,000 less than what they paid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank is trying to rid itself of nonperforming loans, taking $6.1 billion in write-downs the last three years, according to Atlanta-based FIG Partners, a brokerage and research firm. But it still needs to absorb another $5 billion in losses to work through all its real-estate problems, said FIG analyst Chris Marinac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Regions spokesman said the 2006 merger with AmSouth "created higher concentrations in certain asset classes, such as investor real estate, than that of our peers." But the bank, he said, has installed "centralized credit policies" and reduced its condo-loan exposure to $600 million at end of 2009, as compared with $2.2 billion at the time of the merger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only $42 million of its condo loans at the end of 2009 were in the Florida Panhandle, he said, and the ratio of nonperforming loans in the area "is substantially less than in Florida overall."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regions was a big lender in this area when times were good and has long held more local deposits than its rivals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It plowed nearly $2 billion into condo, residential and hotel loans in northwestern Florida from 2002 to 2008, according to local property records, ranging from Panama City in the east to Destin in the west. During the peak, in 2005, it trailed only its far-larger competitor, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, in dollar amount of new loans originated, according to federal data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local real-estate agents say some of the properties Regions financed up and down the Panhandle during the height of the speculation are now worth 30%-50% less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One example is a 1.65-acre beachfront lot in Panama City Beach, overlooking the Gulf of Mexico. Five townhomes, some with broken windows, sit unoccupied on the site. Regions lent the last owner $15.3 million in 2005 to build a 22-story residential tower where the townhouses sit, according to local records and a Realtor familiar with the plans. When the market crashed, Regions foreclosed on the lot and put it on the market this year, asking $6.8 million. "The reality is, beachfront property is worthless right now," said local Realtor Tim Shepard, owner of Shepard Real Estate Group LLC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirty miles west of Panama City Beach is where Mr. Ritter and his wife rode a tide of rising property values by investing in properties inside a 2,400-acre resort that straddles Highway 98.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices on condos and single-family homes in the area more than tripled in the decade leading up to the market's peak in 2005, according to the Florida Housing Data Clearinghouse. In the same period, U.S. home prices rose 72%, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four of Susan Ritter's buys, beginning in 1999, were in Southwinds III, a gated tower flanked on one side by the Gulf and a miniature golf course and lagoons on the other. Susan Ritter bought three more units at the Grand Sandestin, a white-columned, 11-story condo complex financed with a $26 million loan from Regions in 2003. The Ritters were able to sell two units at the Grand Sandestin and Southwinds III for profits in 2005 and 2003, clearing about $200,000 on one and $400,000 on the other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as values dropped, the Ritters chose to sell some of their properties for less than what they paid. In 2008, the Ritters took a combined loss of $409,800 when they sold two other properties at Grand Sandestin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ritters still own three more units at Southwinds III for which they paid $4.1 million, two of them purchased at the height of the market for $1.85 million and $1.64 million. The median sales price for Gulf-front condos in the Sandestin resort area is now $620,000, according to local data, as compared with a high of $847,500 in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ritter also was unable to complete a real-estate flip that could have netted him a $1 million profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2004, he agreed to buy two three-bedroom units on the top floor of the Luau Sandestin, yet another condo tower within sight of Southwinds III. The CEO agreed on a $1.65 million price for the pair and a down payment of $331,960, according to a copy of the contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even before they were complete, Mr. Ritter agreed to sell the units once they were completed to another real-estate investor for $2.6 million. The buyer deposited $269,540 into an escrow account.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Had it worked, the deal would have netted Mr. Ritter close to $1 million. But a hurricane slowed construction, and the units weren't completed in the 24 months required by the contract. The buyer filed a lawsuit and asked for a return of his deposit. Mr. Ritter refused and cited "delays caused by Acts of God." The two sides settled for an unknown amount in 2008. Property records indicate Mr. Ritter never closed on the condos.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Caribbean might be relaxing for vacationers, but it is often anything but for owners of resorts. Case in point: the tiny island of Nevis, where two creditors are trying to force into bankruptcy a hurricane-ravaged Four Seasons resort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hotel investor Maritz Wolff &amp; Co. purchased the 196-room hotel in 1996. Three years later, Hurricane Lenny slammed through Nevis, flooded the hotel's first floor and inflicted substantial damage, forcing the hotel to close for nine months for repairs. In 2008, even as Maritz Wolff negotiated for an extension to its $59 million securitized mortgage, another hurricane—Omar—pounded Nevis. The Four Seasons has yet to reopen, though owners of its 65 private villas still visit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, the special servicer for the mortgage, <span class="companylink">Wachovia Corp</span>., and the banks holding $69 million of mezzanine debt on the hotel have struggled to come to a solution. <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span> intended to foreclose on the hotel last Thursday, but <span class="companylink">Capstead Mortgage Corp</span>., which holds $39 million of the mezzanine debt, blocked that process because it had filed an involuntary bankruptcy petition against the hotel the week before. Capstead was joined in the filing by an architectural firm seeking repayment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Nevis suffers. The island of 12,000 people counted the Four Seasons as its largest employer. "The ability of Nevis residents to survive, feed their families and pay for their homes is dependent on their regular pay from the resort," Nevis Premier Joseph Parry wrote in a March 25 declaration filed in the case.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lennar, the Movie?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his latest salvo against builder <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>., controversial gadfly Barry Minkow is going to Hollywood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Minkow's Fraud Discovery Institute Inc. on Tuesday said it released a trailer for "Too Big to Go to Jail: The Lennar Story." In a drama that seems worthy of a Lifetime movie, the film promises to reveal "a disturbing pattern of apparent fraudulent behavior...ranging from the falsification of government documents to the utilization of their joint ventures to conceal debt and siphon cash from unwitting joint venture partners."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 70-minute show, which, Mr. Minkow promises is professional quality and "not done cheesy with my father's rent-a-camera"—will initially be released in a handful of theaters in and around the three "communities most devastated by Lennar": Hunters Point in San Francisco, El Toro in Irvine, Calif., and Hutto in Texas. Mr. Minkow says he is in discussions for a cable special that could air this summer. He didn't reveal the specific networks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After serving a seven-year jail sentence for securities fraud, Mr. Minkow vowed to smoke out corporate misdeeds upon his 1995 release. He also says he always shorts any company he is reporting on. Miami-based Lennar has previously denied the accusations and sued Mr. Minkow for libel. Lennar declined to comment Tuesday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Block, Web-Style</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government wants to sell an empty, 10-story office building once occupied by the National Institutes of Health. To do it, the General Services Administration is turning to an online auction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> is marketing the 127,110-square-foot building at 7550 Wisconsin Ave. in Bethesda, Md., which will hit the GSA's online auction Web site April 30. The sale is among 15 other buildings the GSA has on the block, and its suggested starting bid is $14 million, said Marc Waddill, the <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> advisor marketing the asset.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It isn't the first time the GSA has gone online to sell a building, a process Mr. Wadill said will "encourage open competition and a near-certain closing date." He declined to speculate on what price the building could fetch, but called the property prime downtown real estate and a good redevelopment opportunity. It is the GSA's largest asset sale in the Washington area in recent years.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A gauge of U.S. home prices improved in January, with many of the nation's most battered markets among the gainers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seasonally adjusted S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index of home prices in 20 major metropolitan areas increased 0.3% in January from a month earlier, the eighth consecutive monthly increase. Twelve of the 20 cities saw price gains over the month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 20-city index dropped 0.7% in January from a year earlier, while prices in a 10-city subset were flat. The readings last grew on a year-to-year basis in January 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report "indicates that the worst of the declines are behind us and we can at least move forward from here," said Adam York, an economist with <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo Securities</span>. "But just like the economy, housing has a long away to go."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, U.S. consumer confidence rebounded in March from a steep drop in February. The Conference Board, a private research group, said its index of consumer confidence increased to 52.5 this month, from a revised 46.4 in February, first reported as 46.0. Consumers' outlook on their present situation, and expectations for the future, both improved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Despite this month's increase, consumers continue to express concern about current business and labor market conditions," said Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board Consumer Research Center. "And, their outlook for the next six months is still rather pessimistic."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday's housing report showed much of the improvement has been in cities where home sales and prices had fallen by the most during the slump. In Las Vegas, the once-hot housing market where prices have since crashed, home prices increased 0.3% in January from a month earlier. In Southern California, San Diego and Los Angeles saw seasonally adjusted home prices increase 0.9% and 1.8% from a month earlier, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as the economic outlook improves, the U.S. housing market remains fragile despite low interest rates and an $8,000 first-time homebuyer tax credit that has been extended to contracts signed by April 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among various indexes that track the housing market, the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index has been among the more optimistic. Last week, the National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes fell 0.6% in February from a month earlier, as a glut of homes for sale and a wave of foreclosures and fire sales hold down housing prices.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Dan Fitzpatrick </div><div>1314 words</div><div>31 March 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Destin, Fla. -- Early last decade,<span class="companylink">Regions Financial Corp</span>. financed an 11-story condominium complex in one of the nation's hottest real-estate markets, the sugary-white sliver of Florida beachfront known as the "Redneck Riviera."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dowd Ritter, the man who would soon run Birmingham, Ala.-based Regions, believed so much in the area's potential that he and his wife bought three units inside the new condo complex and four units in another nearby tower overlooking the Gulf of Mexico, and signed a contract for two more in a third tower. All told, the couple agreed to pay about $7.5 million to buy seven condos from 1999 to 2004, becoming part of the real-estate frenzy that gripped the southeastern U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The interests of the bank and its chief executive converged during the financial crisis, leaving both exposed to one of the nation's worst real-estate markets. Regions, the country's 12th-biggest bank, has lost a combined $6.63 billion over the past two years and still hasn't received approval to pay back $3.5 billion in public support from the U.S. Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program, making it one of the few banks of its size still dependent on government support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 62-year-old Mr. Ritter is scheduled to step down Wednesday as Regions's CEO, although he will remain as a consultant to the company for as many as five years. When Regions announced last December that Mr. Ritter would be leaving, Mr. Ritter said in a release that it was "an appropriate time to retire" and that Regions "is performing well despite the economic downturn."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His successor is former president Grayson Hall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ritter became Regions's CEO in 2006 after leading a merger with crosstown rival AmSouth Bancorp, where he had been CEO since 1996. All of the Florida properties were purchased in the name of Mr. Ritter's wife, Susan, while Mr. Ritter was the CEO of AmSouth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple still owns three condos in the area that they bought for a combined $4.1 million. The Ritters use the properties as vacation getaways, said a person familiar with the family's use of the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Mr. Ritter and the bank both made bets on the area's property market, there is no evidence Mr. Ritter did anything wrong in his purchases or sales of the properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Regions bank spokesman said Mr. Ritter was unavailable to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ritters netted about $195,000 on their investments via the sale of four condo properties. But the last two sold in 2008 for roughly $400,000 less than what they paid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank is trying to rid itself of nonperforming loans, taking $6.1 billion in write-downs the last three years, according to Atlanta-based FIG Partners, a brokerage and research firm. But it still needs to absorb another $5 billion in losses to work through all its real-estate problems, said FIG analyst Chris Marinac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Regions spokesman said the 2006 merger with AmSouth "created higher concentrations in certain asset classes, such as investor real estate, than that of our peers." But the bank, he said, has installed "centralized credit policies" and reduced its condo-loan exposure to $600 million at end of 2009, as compared with $2.2 billion at the time of the merger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only $42 million of its condo loans at the end of 2009 were in the Florida Panhandle, he said, and the ratio of nonperforming loans in the area "is substantially less than in Florida overall."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regions was a big lender in this area when times were good and has long held more local deposits than its rivals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It plowed nearly $2 billion into condo, residential and hotel loans in northwestern Florida from 2002 to 2008, according to local property records, ranging from Panama City in the east to Destin in the west. During the peak, in 2005, it trailed only its far-larger competitor, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, in dollar amount of new loans originated, according to federal data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local real-estate agents say some of the properties Regions financed up and down the Panhandle during the height of the speculation are now worth 30%-50% less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One example is a 1.65-acre beachfront lot in Panama City Beach, overlooking the Gulf of Mexico. Five townhomes, some with broken windows, sit unoccupied on the site. Regions lent the last owner $15.3 million in 2005 to build a 22-story residential tower where the townhouses sit, according to local records and a Realtor familiar with the plans. When the market crashed, Regions foreclosed on the lot and put it on the market this year, asking $6.8 million. "The reality is, beachfront property is worthless right now," said local Realtor Tim Shepard, owner of Shepard Real Estate Group LLC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirty miles west of Panama City Beach is where Mr. Ritter and his wife rode a tide of rising property values by investing in properties inside a 2,400-acre resort that straddles Highway 98.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices on condos and single-family homes in the area more than tripled in the decade leading up to the market's peak in 2005, according to the Florida Housing Data Clearinghouse. In the same period, U.S. home prices rose 72%, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four of Susan Ritter's buys, beginning in 1999, were in Southwinds III, a gated tower flanked on one side by the Gulf and a miniature golf course and lagoons on the other. Susan Ritter bought three more units at the Grand Sandestin, a white-columned, 11-story condo complex financed with a $26 million loan from Regions in 2003. The Ritters were able to sell two units at the Grand Sandestin and Southwinds III for profits in 2005 and 2003, clearing about $200,000 on one and $400,000 on the other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As values dropped, the Ritters chose to sell some of their properties for less than what they paid. In 2008, the Ritters took a combined loss of $409,800 when they sold two other properties at Grand Sandestin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ritters still own three more units at Southwinds III for which they paid $4.1 million, two of them purchased at the height of the market for $1.85 million and $1.64 million. The median sales price for Gulf-front condos in the Sandestin resort area is now $620,000, according to local data, as compared with a high of $847,500 in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ritter also was unable to complete a real-estate flip that could have netted him a $1 million profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2004, he agreed to buy two three-bedroom units on the top floor of the Luau Sandestin, yet another condo tower within sight of Southwinds III. The CEO agreed on a $1.65 million price for the pair and a down payment of $331,960, according to a copy of the contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even before they were complete, Mr. Ritter agreed to sell the units once they were completed to another real-estate investor for $2.6 million. The buyer deposited $269,540 into an escrow account.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Had it worked, the deal would have netted Mr. Ritter close to $1 million. But a hurricane slowed construction, and the units weren't completed in the 24 months required by the contract. The buyer filed a lawsuit and asked for a return of his deposit. Mr. Ritter refused and cited "delays caused by Acts of God." The two sides settled for an unknown amount in 2008. Property records indicate Mr. Ritter never closed on the condos.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ian and Barbara White-Thomson are selling their dream summer house, an oceanfront five-bedroom on Peaks Island, near Portland, Maine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They bought it only three years ago. But it's become a 4,208-square-foot burden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maine Dilemma</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple, who make their home in Pasadena, Calif., sunk nearly $1 million into renovations–on top of the $1.8 million they paid for the home in 2006. They gutted the kitchen and redid the living room. They opened up views to the Atlantic Ocean by removing a fireplace that separated the living and dining areas, putting a glass screen in its place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They say they're still smitten with the place. Nevertheless, last June they listed it for $2.5 million and have since cut the price to $2.3 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The house is really too big for us," says the 73-year-old Mr. White-Thomson, who retired as CEO of Borax, a borate technology company, 10 years ago. "The house is terrific for the one week a year when we can get all of our family and grandchildren there," he adds. He and his wife have three adult children and five grandchildren. "The rest of the time, it's too big, and when we are not there at all it has to be heated and it has to be gardened."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The White-Thomsons aren't the first couple to get stuck with a too-big house in a far-off locale. But now their problems are compounded by the downturn in the luxury home market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices for high-end houses are the lowest  [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704207504575129690814499872.html] they've been in some time. A good time to buy certainly, but also a good time to get swept away in a less-than-ideal transaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are some mistakes to avoid when you're looking to buy a summer house:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. Buying on impulse: "There are residential brokerages with beautiful places on their windows hoping you make that mistake. Don't," says Glenn Kelman, the president and CEO of real-estate site Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. Befriending the Realtor: Since many second-home buyers are new to town, often their only 'friend' is their real-estate agent, "who is going to make a boatload of money when they buy," Mr. Kelman says. "Work your connections to find somebody who knows somebody who already lives there." Those people can provide insight into the realities of living in the area and even about a particular property. "There are so many times where the only guy who would buy that house is the only one who has no idea what its history is," he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. Forgetting maintenance costs: "Often, [second homes] are in extreme places," says Mr. Kelman. "It's expensive to heat the pool in Whistler, British Columbia, and it's expensive to keep the locusts off in Costa Rica." Regardless of location, the costs of landscaping, mowing and pool maintenance must be considered. As the White-Thomsons learned, you'll have to pay those costs even when you're not there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4. Not thinking about the weather: In some areas, such as Florida, extra insurance for events like hurricanes is an added factor. Storm damages can add to upkeep costs, as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5. Buying in a popular spot: A weekend home can pose a problem if it's in a very popular place, like New York's tony Hamptons. Traffic out to Long Island's east end can be a bear on a Friday–and not everyone has their own helicopter. "All of a sudden Friday at 6:00 comes along and they are piling everyone into a car," says Kathy Braddock, a co-founder of <span class="companylink">Charles Rutenberg Realty</span>. "You spend the entire time talking about what time you should leave on Sunday to avoid the traffic," she adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">6. Buying in the boonies: If air travel is required to get to the second home, it should be reasonably close to the airport, Mr. Kelman says. "You don't want to fly there and then rent a car and drive there for God knows how long," he says. "If it's in the boonies near where you live, you don't want it to be so far away that you can't get there without ducking out of work at 4:00." For the White-Thomsons having a second home closer to their primary residence in California may have allowed them to use it more, but they made a commitment to use the home at least two months a year. "If you don't use it, it's a tremendously expensive hotel," Mr. White-Thomson says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">7. Forgetting that you might have grandchildren: Empty nesters who buy a second home may outgrow it quickly when grandchildren start to arrive. "I hear lots of stories of people buying, say, a condo in Florida that they plan to retire in," says Amy Bohutinsky, a vice president of communications at real-estate site <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span>. A condo sounds great when the kids are in college, but soon enough you have grandchildren. "What used to be a family of four is now a family of eight and kids running around and all of a sudden you can't fit."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">8. Forgetting that you might not want to see your grandchildren: On the other hand some empty nesters don't want to accommodate the entire family. "It's kind of a chance to cleanse" after years of needing ample storage space and extra rooms to accommodate a family, says Ms. Braddock. Rather than maintaining a larger home, it might make more sense to rent hotel rooms for extra guests, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">9. Not checking out the rental rates: Those people who use a home only for a few weeks a year and want to rent it the rest of the time should look into the property's rental history before buying, says Jim Oxnam, a broker with Brown Harris Stevens in the Hamptons. "If someone needs the money to pay the mortgage or to improve the house, it might be nice to rent the house for a season," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">10. Thinking you want a summer home: "A lot of people get very caught up with the idea that a weekend home would be a lovely thing to have, but I don't think they put a lot of thought into if they really want to go there every weekend," says Ms. Braddock, who lives in New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When her children were young, Ms. Braddock and her ex-husband had owned a second home where the activities revolved around the kids. More recently she rented a cottage in Staatsburg, in New York's Hudson Valley, paying about $2,700 a month on a year-long lease. This time around her oldest was in college and the other in high school, and she and her partner were pretty bored. Looking at antiques, reading the paper and walking around nearby Rhinebeck take up only so much time, she says: "It was the greatest validation that I don't want a weekend house."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Craig Karmin </div><div>1174 words</div><div>29 March 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trump SoHo hotel and condominium, first announced during an episode of Donald Trump's hit television show, "The Apprentice," is poised to open next month amid much public fanfare. But the road there has often been bumpy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite a brisk start, only about a third of the 391 units in the outsized 46-story building are in contract, and it isn't clear how many of them will actually close. That process won't begin until the hotel opens on April 9.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> recently dumped a mezzanine loan on the project for a fraction of its $75 million face value, according to people familiar with the matter. Now, the developer is in restructuring talks with lenders who hold some $350 million in debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The note is being restructured in a way that we believe will be beneficial for all parties," said Y. David Scharf, an attorney for the building's ownership group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The issues facing the building provide the latest glimpse into how Mr. Trump has managed to navigate the economic downturn largely intact. As he did for many of his projects over the past 15 years, he has invested none of his own money in the Trump SoHo. His deal with the developers, a venture of Sapir Organization and Bayrock Group, is primarily a hotel-management and licensing arrangement</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the disappointing sales at the Trump SoHo expose a huge fault line in the condo-hotel business model. The developers' strategy was to sell the units -- at prices starting at $1.2 million for a studio -- to investors who would be allowed to stay in them no more than 120 days a year. The rest of the time the units would be operated as hotel rooms under the Trump brand with the investors and the developers sharing the profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But sales of units in condo-hotel projects throughout the country have ground to a halt because they're practically impossible to finance. Investors have to pay cash, and they're reluctant to do so because of the overall weakness of the hotel market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, other condo-hotel projects under the Trump brand have run into trouble. The Trump International Hotel &amp;Tower in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., faces foreclosure after developers defaulted on a $139 million loan, though the <span class="companylink">Trump Organization</span> had only a licensing agreement that has since been terminated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Trump International Hotel &amp;Tower in Las Vegas -- in which Mr. Trump was a major equity investor -- last year was in restructuring talks with its creditors partly because 70% of the buyers of its units didn't close on their deals. That development recently successfully paid down a large portion of its construction loan and got an extension on the rest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The condo hotel "was a bull market development," said Andrew R. Berman, the director and a professor at the Center for Real Estate Studies at New York Law School. "It's a complicated structure to explain that appeals to a particular niche buyer during the best of times, and these are still difficult times."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trump has had a long history with condo hotels. He helped reinvigorate the business in New York in 1997 when he opened the Trump International Hotel &amp;Tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developers of Trump SoHo chose the condo-hotel model because the building is in a manufacturing zone, which bars them from offering permanent residences. To move forward, they agreed to build a condo-hotel where owners can't stay for more than about four months a year, or for more than 29 straight days during any 36-day period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the development has been controversial. Neighbors in SoHo complained about its scale and architectural style. At 454 feet, the boxy glass tower dwarfs the cast-iron buildings in the historic district that surrounds it. The deal the developers cut with Mayor Michael Bloomberg to enable the condo hotel to go forward "perverts the intent of the zoning regulation," said Stuart Klein, an attorney for SoHo Alliance, a local preservation group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Donald Trump Jr., executive vice president of development and acquisitions for <span class="companylink">Trump Organization</span>, said that the community attitude has changed. "People who were initial detractors now realize the positive benefits the project will have on the area," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property took on national prominence in 2006, when Mr. Trump unveiled the new project on his TV show. His children, Ivanka, Eric and Donald Trump, got involved in the building's design decisions and marketing, pitching the project as a five-star hotel for a hipper crowd than those at Manhattan's midtown and uptown luxury spots. Under his marketing and licensing deal, Mr. Trump and his children were given an equity stake of about 18%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial interest was promising. About 1,000 investors submitted "reservations," or nonbinding expressions of interest to buy, according to the people familiar with the matter. But this caused a debate among the partners. Mr. Trump and Bayrock wanted to charge around $2,200 a square foot for the condo units. They estimated that at that price, they could pay off the $275 million in senior debt by selling about 50% of the 391 units, these people said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given that interest, the other development partner, Alex Sapir, wanted to charge no less than $3,000 a square foot. The other partners got him down to around $2,900 a foot for initial buyers. But after the first 100 or so units went to contract in the fall of 2007, buying stalled and there has been scant activity since, said the people familiar with the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One lender has already bowed out. When <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> recently sold mezzanine debt with a $75 million face value to senior lender <span class="companylink">iStar Financial</span> for a small fraction of that amount, it suggested that the bank saw its loan as essentially worthless, say industry experts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IStar is now restructuring that debt. Andrew G. Backman, an investor relations official for <span class="companylink">iStar Financial</span>, the senior lender, added: "We are not currently planning on foreclosing on the project."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trump SoHo anticipates a boost in interest when guests check in after the hotel opens. But like most condo-hotel buildings, the business model relies on condo sales to provide most of the revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 2013 or 2014, Trump SoHo should be able to charge more than $600 a night for a hotel room, said Roland deMilleret of HVS, a global hotel consulting firm. But for now, he estimates room rates will be in the low to mid $400s. "During that ramp-up period, they need to rely on condo sales, and that will be challenging," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trump Soho and its neighborhood antagonists share at least one victory. After the condo-hotel compromise, the city changed its zoning laws so that no other developer is likely to be allowed to build a property as high as Trump SoHo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It will never happen again," Mr. Trump said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anna Prior   </div><div>1364 words</div><div>27 March 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>In-Depth Reports</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People who think about moving to a new home in retirement invariably plan on buying that home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases, though, renting might be a better option.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate markets remain volatile. Even though home prices appear to be stabilizing in some areas, there's still a chance that the house you buy today could fall in value tomorrow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For anyone weighing a move, one of the easiest ways to approach the buy-versus-rent question is to use the "price-to-rent ratio," says Dean Baker, co-director at the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take two houses of similar size and quality—one for sale and one for rent—in the same neighborhood, or comparable neighborhoods. Take the price of the home for sale and divide it by the total cost of renting the other house for a year. If the resulting number is higher than 20, it's likely the price of the home for sale could fall further. Thus, renting might be a better option, says Mr. Baker. However, the price is most likely near its low if the figure is 15 or below; 15 is the general average price-to-rent ratio over time, Mr. Baker says, and the number at which rental and ownership costs are close to even.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renting, particularly in urban settings, has "become a lot more attractive," says Hessam Nadji, the managing director of research services at Marcus &amp;Millichap Real Estate Investment Services, a real-estate investment brokerage firm based in Encino, Calif. Apartments and condos offer retirees easy access to culture, entertainment and leisure, with reduced maintenance burdens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But both Mr. Baker and Mr. Nadji say many factors should be weighed when considering renting versus owning. "If you have reason to believe you are building equity," Mr. Baker says, it's fine to pay more to own. A low price-to-rent ratio on a property that you plan on being in for a decade should be an attractive buy option even if the monthly payment is higher than renting, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But on the flip side, he adds, "if you are paying more in a context where you are unlikely to build equity, either because house prices are likely to fall or you won't be there long enough to cover transaction costs, then you are throwing money away."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's a look at the housing and rental markets in 10 popular retirement destinations to help you decide whether to buy or rent. We've included data from Marcus &amp;Millichap and from the Council for Community and Economic Research, a nonprofit in Arlington, Va. Appliance repair costs are estimates. The average monthly home payments are based on fourth-quarter median prices, assuming a 10% down payment and a 5.07% rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nadji and Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, also shared their analyses of the markets and numbers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Albuquerque, N.M.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median home price: $178,197 Average monthly home payment: $1,160 Average rent: $667 Price of appliance repair: $64.98 (7% above national average)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Albuquerque isn't a growth market right now," says Mr. Nadji. "Housing prices are still higher" than where they should be, especially since "there's an ocean of excess housing supply yet to be absorbed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charlotte, N.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median home price: $186,945 Average monthly home payment: $1,217 Average rent: $677 Price of appliance repair: $62.25 (2% above average)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charlotte's home prices are above the national average of $174,227. When that's coupled with rental prices far below the $937 per-unit national average and a local vacancy rate of 11.3%, "it makes renting more attractive," says Mr. Nadji.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greenville, S.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median home price: $138,929 Average monthly home payment: $904 Average rent: $570 Price of appliance repair: $61.89 (1% above average)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rents and home prices in Greenville are below the national average, a sign good deals can be had either way. "Rents in particular are sizably below the national average," Mr. Nadji says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median home price: $139,700 Average monthly home payment: $909 Average rent: $758 Price of appliance repair: $62.44 (2% above average)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While there's been a lot of buying activity in Las Vegas as people look for deals, the oversupply of homes means buyers shouldn't expect a rebound in values for a while, says Mr. Yun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nadji says the rental and housing markets in Las Vegas both "have just been amazingly beaten down." So, he says, there's a surplus of "very high-end, high-amenity condos that are both for sale and for rent."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Miami</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median home price: $192,562 Average monthly home payment: $1,254 Average rent: $969 Price of appliance repair: $74.97 (23% above average)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Florida was one of the earliest markets into the housing crash," Mr. Nadji says. "You would expect it to be coming out of it, but it's not," and probably won't be for three to five years, he says. For now, he sees urban, high-end condos for sale or rent as good opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rental vacancies in Miami have climbed to 5.8% from 3.9% in 2007, he adds. Couple that with the high cost of repair services, and renting could be an attractive option for some.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orlando, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median home price: $140,779 Average monthly home payment: $916 Average rent: $773 Price of appliance repair: $65.17 (7% above average)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's a good chance buyers can find a great deal on a home in Orlando, Mr. Nadji says. But, as in the rest of the state, the housing market in the Orlando area is still in flux.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median home price: $143,744 Average monthly home payment: $936 Average rent: $676 Price of appliance repair: $59.79 (2% below average)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix also has an oversupply of homes. But from a lifestyle perspective, says Mr. Nadji, the low housing costs, relatively low cost of services and numerous amenities (read: loads of golf courses) make a good case for buying instead of renting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sacramento, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median home price: $189,653 Average monthly home payment: $1,235 Average rent: $851 Price of appliance repair: $53.40 (12% below average)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Prices have really come down in Sacramento," says Mr. Yun, and it's one of the more affordable locations in California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, like Albuquerque, there is a large supply of rentals, especially of single-family homes, says Mr. Nadji. As such, renting remains a reasonable option.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Diego</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median home price: $387,816 Average monthly home payment: $2,525 Average rent: $1,249 Price of appliance repair: $46.79 (23% below average)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Diego presents an attractive buying opportunity. Prices have stabilized and in many cases are going up, says Mr. Yun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Services are also below the national average, which puts another check in the buy column.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One locale where renting might make sense: downtown San Diego. Mr. Nadji says, "Right now, there's pretty good availability of rentals, even though it's below the national average at 4.9%. Even at that vacancy rate, there are nice, good-quality rental units that have been built in the last few years."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tampa/St. Petersburg, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median home price: $138,074 Average monthly home payment: $899 Average rent: $743 Price of appliance repair: $52.99 (13% below average)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tampa used to get wealthier baby boomers moving into the region, says Mr. Yun. Lately, though, people have been leaving the area, he says. Like the rest of Florida, oversupply plagues the Tampa market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With rental vacancies at 10.7%, well above the 8% national average according to Mr. Nadji, renting might prove to be a good choice. If you do buy, says Mr. Nadji, don't expect a big return on investment in the immediate future.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos and James R. Hagerty </div><div>1595 words</div><div>27 March 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B7</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daniel Horowitz is ready to bargain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 55-year-old trial lawyer is trying to sell a four-bedroom villa with marble imported from Italy, a winery and a fruit orchard on 14 acres in Lafayette, Calif. He already chopped the price to $3.2 million from $4 million, the amount he estimates having spent on the land and construction. "We thought it would sell right away," he says. But it hasn't, and he is willing to consider lower offers, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three years into the housing bust, steep discounts are emerging in the market for high-end homes, which had been the real-estate industry's last redoubt until now. Despite the budding economic recovery, demand for pricey properties is falling as potential buyers struggle to come up with money for big down payments and find it difficult to qualify for large mortgages. With buyers dropping out and homes languishing on the market, sellers are beginning to capitulate, cutting prices to move their properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result: Buyers with lots of cash, or access to it, can find great deals. Not all million-dollar homes are castles, especially in coastal markets. But price drops and relatively small bumps in budget are landing shoppers the kind of amenities -- kingly bathrooms, stables, gates -- that were once beyond reach. Kenneth Rosen, chairman of the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at the University of California, Berkeley, says it is a "very good time to be a buyer at the high end."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some markets, houses that are more than twice the size of others are on the market for less than twice the cost. Shaun Rawls, a broker at <span class="companylink">Keller Williams Realty</span> in Atlanta, points to two homes with similarly desirable locations in that city's wealthy Buckhead district. The smaller home, with 3,060 square feet, is priced at $765,000, or $250 a square foot. The larger home, with 7,612 square feet, has an asking price of $1.2 million, or $158 per square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though larger homes often have lower square-footage costs than smaller homes, the gap today is often greater. In Mill Valley, Calif., a 1,127-square-foot three-bedroom listed at $898,000 just went under contract. Its per-square-foot cost: $797. A four-bedroom home five minutes away -- and nearly three times the size at 3,077 square feet -- is being listed at $1.5 million. Its square-foot cost: $486.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, in Scottsdale, Ariz., one four-bedroom home lists for $1.2 million while another lists for $1.48 million. That additional $280,000 buys a 5,400 square-foot home, 46% bigger than the cheaper house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The million-plus market seems ripe for falling prices. Until now it has been lower-end homes, which saw the sharpest run-up during the boom, that have borne the brunt of the housing bust. Though there aren't national statistics that track the million-dollar market, local markets show that prices for top properties have room to drop. For example, the bottom third of the Los Angeles area market -- currently homes under $300,000 -- has seen prices fall by 52.5% since the market peak in 2006, returning to April 2003 levels, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller indexes. Prices for the top third of the market -- currently homes above $510,000 -- have fallen by 27.3% from the peak, to March 2004 levels. While prices at the bottom of the market gained 5% over the last quarter of 2009 from the previous quarter, high-end home prices dropped 0.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales across the board remain sluggish. Sales of existing homes fell 0.6% last month to a seasonally adjusted rate of 5.02 million units, while new-home sales fell by 2.2% last month to lows last seen in 1963. But the mismatch of supply and demand is now widest in the seven-figure market. In the most coveted Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, for example, supplies are fairly tight up to about $900,000. But it is a buyer's market between that level and $2 million, says James W. Nellis II of Re/Max Allegiance, a local broker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That makes for some deep discounts. In Mill Valley, Calif., the price on one four-bedroom home was reduced March 11 to $2 million from $3 million. The house has 2,500 square feet of decks overlooking San Francisco Bay, says the listing agent, Suzy Doyle. On Ranch Gate Road in Chula Vista, Calif., a foreclosed home with six bedrooms is being offered at $675,000. In 2006, when it was new, the home sold for $1.3 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few people consider million-dollar homes cheap, of course. Stretching to buy a big home comes with obvious risks. Prices may be falling, but no one knows where the bottom is. Marc Carpenter, a real-estate agent in San Diego, cautions buyers in that battered market that, "If you buy now, [you should] plan on prices reducing over time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another potential pitfall is that higher-end houses are much harder to value than lower priced cookie-cutter dwellings. Often, high-end homes are unique, and the prices they fetch may have to do with such intangibles as an ocean view or an address with more snob appeal than those just blocks away. That makes it much harder for buyers to find comparable sales indicative of true market value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bargain hunters also need to be realistic. They aren't likely to get a steal on the best-preserved homes in the nation's top neighborhoods -- places like Central Park West in Manhattan, Santa Barbara, Calif., or the exclusive parts of Boulder, Colo. Supply is permanently constrained in such areas because there is little room to build. And lots of people with money are eager to move in, so prices are likely to come down only slightly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best deals will be on high-end homes that might need work or aren't in the most highly sought-after locations. That leaves plenty of coveted neighborhoods with good schools and amenities to choose from.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the risks, the mortgage market might be suggesting that shoppers buy sooner rather than later. Many forecasters predict that interest rates will rise from today's unusually low levels, in part because the Federal Reserve this month is ending its heavy purchases of mortgage securities. Even if waiting another year might bring lower prices, at least some of that advantage could be wiped out by an interest-rate spike.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest rates play a huge role in affordability -- and even more so in high-end markets. A $1.2 million home today might require a 25% down payment, says Lou Barnes, a mortgage banker in Boulder. At today's rate of about 5.75% for a 30-year "jumbo" mortgage, that would mean a monthly payment of $5,252. But if rates were to rise to 6.5%, the monthly payment would rise to $5,688. The home's price would have to fall $1.1 million to keep the monthly payment at a comparable $5,215.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the demand side, the technicalities of the mortgage market are thinning the ranks of million-dollar home buyers more than usual. Most buyers need a mortgage and would much prefer a cheaper, mainstream one backed by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> or the Federal Housing Administration. But loans that meet the government's criteria can be no larger than $417,000 in most of the U.S.; in higher-cost areas like New York and San Francisco, that limit stretches to $729,750.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Loans above those limits are considered jumbos. While rates on jumbos are way down from a high of about 7.9% in October 2008, they remain well above the 5.1% found on conventional loans guaranteed by Fannie or Freddie, according to HSH Associates. What's more, lenders also require heftier down payments for jumbo loans -- in some cases 25% or more of the home's value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shrinking pool of potential buyers is giving people of means unusual bargaining power. The inventory of all listed homes in February was enough to last 8.6 months at the current sales rate, according to the National Association of Realtors, a trade group. For those priced above $1 million, the supply was enough to last nearly 32 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For these reasons, "this is the perfect time to buy," says Eric Awad, a neurologist in Atlanta who thinks market conditions are forcing sellers of high-end homes to knuckle under. He and his wife, Nachwa Jarkas, an assistant professor at Emory University, are eager to trade up from their town home and buy a four-bedroom house in Atlanta's posh Buckhead district. They are looking in the range of $1 million to $1.2 million, though Dr. Awad hopes to "knock the price down" below $1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many potential buyers of high-end homes, the couple has a big hurdle to clear: Before buying, they need to sell their town home, which is on the market for $575,000, and they have no idea how long it will take for them to find a buyer. In this still-troubled real-estate market, success favors buyers who don't have to sell first.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Olympian Lewis Lists</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home for $2.6 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carl Lewis, the retired track-and-field star who won nine gold and one silver Olympic medals, has listed his home in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Pacific Palisades for $2.6 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lewis purchased the home for $1.75 million in 2002 and remodeled the kitchen, pool and backyard, among many improvements. The Mediterranean-inspired house in the Santa Monica Mountains includes a gazebo, views of the Pacific Ocean and a fish pond with a waterfall. The master suite includes a see-through fireplace in between the bedroom and an office/library.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 1980s and early '90s, the sprinter and long jumper, whose full name is Frederick Carlton Lewis, also won a number of gold World Championship medals. His manager says Mr. Lewis volunteers with youth track groups and plans to soon launch a health and lifestyle social-networking Web site. Edna Gyepes, an agent with Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerages in Pacific Palisades, and Lorene Roberts, with Palisades Realty, have the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DHL Co-Founder's Cuts</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With two Idaho properties languishing on the market, <span class="companylink">DHL Worldwide Express</span> delivery co-founder William Armsted Robinson has cut their prices by about 15% each. He's now asking $14.5 million for his horse ranch and $12.5 million for a nearby fishing property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 72-year-old businessman, who finished selling his DHL stake in 2003, bought the lots in the 1990s and built homes and other structures on them. Mr. Robinson is selling because he's spending more time in his hometown of Shreveport, La., a spokesman said. The 938-acre horse ranch borders a national forest and has indoor and outdoor arenas, stables and a veterinary clinic. There's a pool, a tennis court and a hangar and airstrip, and 760 acres are under a conservation easement. The 600-acre fishing property, about 10 miles north, includes more than a mile of the Fall River. Roger Brink and Vance Moulton of Alta Realty have the listings, which came on the market in 2008 and 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Former Firehouse Sells</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Art collector John Traina's landmarked San Francisco property -- a converted 1893 firehouse once owned by former California Gov. Jerry Brown -- has sold for $3.36 million, about 30% less than its original $4.85 million asking price in September 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Traina is a retired maritime entrepreneur formerly married to novelist Danielle Steel, with whom he raised seven children. He bought the roughly 4,000-square-foot firehouse in a 2006 private sale. The Pacific Heights estate has three bedrooms, four baths and a guest house. The fire poles remain in the living room, and the original garage door opens into the great room, where fire trucks once parked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Traina sold because he was spending most of him time at a Napa Valley ranch he owns, says Greg Lynn of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>, who shared the listing with <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> Louis Silcox. Steven Mavromihalis of Pacific Union Real Estate, a Christie's Great Estates affiliate, represented the buyer, a local family.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies boosted their orders for capital goods such as machinery and computers in February, in an encouraging sign that U.S. business is confident enough to support the economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A key barometer of business investment -- orders for nondefense capital goods, excluding aircraft -- rose 1.1% last month, erasing part of a sharp drop in January, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall orders for durable goods -- long-lasting items ranging from semiconductor chips to semi-trailer trucks -- rose 0.5% to a seasonally adjusted $178.12 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The uptick in capital-goods orders added to economists' hopes that rising business spending can help lead the recovery, compensating for cautious consumers and a moribund housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, though, the pace of the business-sector expansion doesn't appear to be fast enough to drive a sharp economic rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The business sector is batting doubles, but it's not hitting it out of the park," said Zach Pandl, economist at Nomura Securities in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The past two months' data suggest business investment is on track to grow at an annualized, inflation-adjusted rate of about 5.6% in the first quarter of 2010, according to forecasting firm <span class="companylink">Macroeconomic Advisers</span>, less than a third the blistering pace of the last quarter of 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other indicators suggest growing optimism among businesses. In a survey of 620 U.S. firms conducted last month by Duke University and CFO Magazine, companies said that they expected capital spending to grow by 8.9% over the next 12 months. That's up from 1.5% in the previous survey, conducted in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a very conservative approach to capital spending, but capital spending is occurring where it creates an advantage," said Daryl Dulaney, chief executive of Siemens Industry Inc., which makes products ranging from engineering software to high-speed rail equipment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising business investment can often presage an increase in hiring -- something many economists expect to see when the Labor Department reports on March employment early next month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think you're in the process of turning and in the next several months you'll see genuine increases in employment -- not vigorous ones mind you, but positive numbers," said <span class="companylink">Daiwa Securities America</span> economist Michael Moran.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Businesses still have a long way to go to reach the levels of investment that prevailed before the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the fourth quarter of 2009, spending on equipment and software was still 17.6% below its 2007 peak. Overall, net private investment -- capital spending on everything from houses to factories, minus depreciation -- stood at only 1.3% of economic output, compared with a 20-year average of about 5.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies are focusing spending on equipment that can deliver an immediate benefit, rather than items whose benefit will accrue over years. Mr. Dulaney of <span class="companylink">Siemens</span> said he had seen an increase in orders for automation equipment; demand for green technology such as equipment for wind turbines is also on the rise. The weakest area for spending, he said, was nonresidential construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When <span class="companylink">FedEx Corp</span>. last week discussed its results for the latest quarter, the package-delivery company said it expected increased spending on <span class="companylink">Boeing Co</span>. aircraft to boost its capital spending for the year ending May 31 to $2.9 billion, up from an earlier forecast of $2.6 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">FedEx</span> also said it would reinstate employee-bonus programs frozen last year in a cost-cutting move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More so than after past recessions, the economic recovery depends on businesses' willingness to invest. Heavy debts taken on in boom times are still weighing on U.S. consumers, while depressed prices and a glut of vacant homes are holding back investment in real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report Wednesday, the Commerce Department said sales of new, single-family homes fell 2.2% in February from January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 308,000 -- the lowest level since records began in 1963.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That suggests new home construction, typically an important driver of growth in the early stages of an economic recovery, will remain lackluster.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. durable-goods orders rose a third straight month in February, while a sign of capital spending climbed, indicating U.S. businesses have confidence in the recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, sales of new homes in the U.S. fell in February primarily because of snowstorms and layoffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturers' orders for goods designed to last at least three years increased 0.5%, to a seasonally adjusted $178.12 billion, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If not for the defense sector, durables would have risen higher. Defense-related capital-goods orders fell 4.5%. Excluding defense, all other durables rose 1.6% in February, after gaining 1.7% in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall January durables surged ahead 3.9%, revised from a previously reported 2.6% increase. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast durables would climb 0.7% in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft rose by 1.1% last month. The orders are seen as a barometer of capital spending by businesses. Business spending on equipment and software has risen significantly, Federal Reserve policy makers said last week in a statement on their latest meeting over interest rates and the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft shipments, used in calculating gross domestic product, increased 0.8%, a positive sign for the economy in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 0.5% increase in overall durables last month marked the third climb in a row. Unlike some sectors, such as housing, factories are doing well. Manufacturing payrolls grew last month, while overall employment and construction jobs each fell, according to Labor Department data. The Institute for Supply Management says manufacturing has grown seven months in a row.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sign of future demand in the factory sector, unfilled manufacturers' orders, rose 0.4% in February, the second increase after a record 15 straight declines, Wednesday's durables data showed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturers' inventories of durable goods rose 0.3%. Overall durable-goods shipments of manufacturers fell 0.6% last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for transportation-related goods fell 0.7%, brought down by cars and military airplanes. All other durable-goods orders, excluding transportation, climbed 0.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for single-family homes fell 2.2% from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 308,000, setting a new record low, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. Records began in 1963. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had estimated sales would rise 1.9%, to 315,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though it is closely watched by economists, the new-home sales report is volatile at this time of year because it is based on a particularly small sample during housing's slow winter season. The government said it was 90% confident that the true change in new-home sales in January was between minus 17.5% and plus 13.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Year-over-year, sales were lower by 13% from February 2009 -- despite a big government tax credit. Buyers are passing up on new homes in favor of cheaper used homes. Some economists are projecting an extended $8,000 incentive for first-time buyers could lead to increased activity in the spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's new-home sales data showed inventories picking up slightly again. There were an estimated 236,000 homes for sale at the end of February, a 1.3% increase from 233,000 in January.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest data on the U.S. housing market underscored its fragility as the overall economy recovers, and showed that a glut of homes for sale and a wave of foreclosures and fire sales are holding down housing prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes fell 0.6% in February from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.02 million, the National Association of Realtors said. Severe winter weather hurt sales in February. In December and January, sales suffered a hangover from a surge in sales in the autumn as buyers moved to take advantage of an expiring tax credit, which since has been extended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The expiration of that tax credit [and severe winter weather] has caused home sales to crash," Steven Wood of Insight Economics wrote in a research note. "Because the tax credit has been extended and expanded, there should be a recovery in sales over the next two months."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax break now covers sales through April 30 that close before July 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sale price for an existing home was $165,100 in February, down 1.8% from February 2009, the Realtors said. Distressed homes, generally sold at a discount, accounted for 35% of sales last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report Tuesday from the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> showed house prices fell 0.6% in January. The FHFA index -- which tracks the prices of the same houses over time, but only those sold to or guaranteed by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> or the Federal Home Loan Banks -- is 13.2% below its April 2007 peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories of existing homes increased 9.5% at the end of the month to 3.59 million available for sale, the Realtors said. That represented a 8.6-month supply at the current sales pace, compared with a 7.8-month supply in January.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anton Troianovski   </div><div>745 words</div><div>24 March 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some parts of the health-care overhaul, such as the prospect of a new tax on rental income, have raised concerns among landlords. But some real-estate developers see a silver lining: the prospect that 32 million additional people with health insurance will drive new demand for medical office space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York, health-care real-estate broker Paul Wexler of <span class="companylink">Corcoran Group</span> says he is seeing increased interest in medical office space in areas where many currently uninsured people live. "There will be a need for medical providers to be in these areas where people now go to emergency rooms or go to other places to get their care," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of his clients, ophthalmologist Mark Fromer, in December purchased a 13,000-square-foot office condominium in the Bronx, expanding out of a 3,000-square-foot space. For now, he is just building out 7,000 square feet of his new office, but he plans to expand if demand rises in the next few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That was with this idea in mind that there are going to be many, many more people to take care of," said Dr. Fromer, whose practice, Fromer Eye Centers, has three offices and 10 doctors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Debra Cafaro, chief executive of <span class="companylink">Ventas Inc</span>., a real-estate investment trust that owns senior-citizen housing, hospitals and medical offices, said companies like Ventas also could benefit from the planned federal changes to health care. "Health-care reform is going to be positive for health-care REITs and health-care real estate," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is because she expects demand for medical space to rise, even though she said her company is being more careful to vet potential tenants because some will suffer in the new environment, due in part to changes in reimbursement levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We all know that demographics support health-care real estate," Ms. Cafaro said. "But adding to that demand from an aging population, now you're going to have higher utilization because you're going to have a pool of uninsured people having access to the health-care system."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, the health-care overhaul has costs, too. To help pay for the changes, the House version of the health-care bill would impose a new 3.8% Medicare tax on the investment income of upper-income tax payers. That would include rental income, which generated $268 billion of personal income for Americans last year, according to the Commerce Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors, a trade group, was disappointed by that provision. In a letter last week to Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, the Realtors called this tax "stunningly complex" and said it would "impair and delay further recovery" in real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the NAR also noted that 28% of Realtors, most of whom are independent contractors, don't have health-care insurance. "This bill helps them get the health insurance they need," said a spokesman for the group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the health-care overhaul has made investors wary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There have been a lot of folks that . . . have been on the sidelines, understandably so, until the final rules get written," Jay Flaherty, chief executive of health-care real-estate company <span class="companylink">HCP Inc</span>., said in a conference call with analysts in November. "There is a dam getting ready to burst here with health-care reform."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">R.W. Baird &amp;Co</span>. analyst David AuBuchon last week downgraded the health-care real-estate investment trust sector, arguing that the stocks were overvalued relative to his outlook for the sector. However, clarity in health-care policy "should provide a more visible runway for deals," he wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Cleveland, Eileen Sheil, a spokeswoman for the Cleveland Clinic, said there wasn't yet a shortage of hospital beds in the city. But the nonprofit medical institution plans to build a new, $25 million chronic-care center as it focuses on expanding its outpatient facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's definitely capacity, so I don't see a surge in real estate," Ms. Sheil said. "But there will be a need for more updated facilities and reconfiguring facilities that are currently in existence because they're not meeting the needs of the way patients are treated now."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Josh Barbanel </div><div>548 words</div><div>24 March 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Manhattan condominium owned by a financially troubled Italian film producer was sold in a foreclosure auction for $33.2 million, the highest price paid for Manhattan apartment this year and a sign that New York real estate prices are stabilizing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Chinese businessman who was not identified purchased the 5,500-square-foot apartment with 20-foot ceilings and views of Central Park that had been owned by Vittorio Cecchi Gori, the producer of more than 200 films including "Il Postino" and "Life is Beautiful." The new buyer paid the lofty price of more than $6,000 a square foot even though the apartment was in ruins after being gutted by Mr. Cecchi Gori for a renovation. The sale closed on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price in the current deal underscores signs of recovery in luxury housing in Manhattan in the last few months, after an extended period of sluggish sales and falling prices. It followed a series of high closing prices on other luxury cooperatives and condominiums last December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last June, when sales in the Manhattan market were still largely stalled, a Russian businessman agreed to pay $18 million for the apartment, in Trump International Hotel and Tower. But that deal fell apart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest in the Cecchi Gori condo has been intense. After the deal with the Russian businessman collapsed, four buyers stepped forward late last year and made offers at or above $18 million, according to Howard Margolis, the broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman who worked on the sale for the last year. That led to a formal auction, which was held in January and continued for five hours and 35 rounds of bidding between two of the bidders, brokers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The winning bid of $33.2 million was made by a limited liability company, listed in care of Rothschild Bank &amp;Trust in Zurich. But brokers in the building said the actual buyer was a Chinese businessman involved in manufacturing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cecchi Gori's financial troubles predate the latest recession, and involve complicated allegations of a bankruptcy fraud in Italy that date back years, and that put him in jail for a time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Niels Juul, the temporary chief executive of Mr. Checchi Gori's Los Angeles production company, Checchi Gori Pictures, said the film producer expected to be completely vindicated by the Italian courts, and was currently involved in several film productions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Court records show that Mr. Cecchi Gori eventually fell behind on a $28 million debt to <span class="companylink">Fortress Investment Group</span>. The loan was secured by three houses, in New York, London and Los Angeles, each of which has now been sold. Mr. Juul said that with the higher sale price on the New York apartment, Mr. Cecchi Gori expected eventually to receive some of the proceeds of the auction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment, which Mr. Cecchi Gori bought in 1997 for $10.4 million, also was owned at one point by developer Donald Trump, who paid $5 million for it in 1997. But after Mr. Trump separated from his then-wife, Marla Maples, he listed the apartment for rent at the then-astronomical sum of $100,000 a month. Mr. Cecchi Gori bought it a few months later.</p>

</div><div class="author">By                         Deborah Lynn Blumberg                      and Kejal Vyas   </div><div>715 words</div><div>24 March 2010</div><div>17:02</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- Reality hit the Treasury market with a vengeance Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bond prices sank and most yields posted double-digit rises as concerns over the U.S.'s ballooning debt burden came to the fore amid the realization that the economy is more fragile than many had thought. That means official rates will remain on hold for a while -- as the Federal Reserve said they would last week -- prompting investors to look for higher yields in other asset classes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, demand in the Treasury Dept.'s sale of new debt was weaker than expected, adding further pressure to the government bond market and raising the government's cost of borrowing -- a bad sign given the U.S.'s hefty deficit of around 10% of gross domestic product.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By mid-afternoon Wednesday, the 10-year yield was about 14 basis points higher than it was at the end of last week, and the 30-year yield was about 13 basis points higher. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You're starting to see a little bit of a Treasury market protest," said Ward McCarthy, managing director of the fixed income division at <span class="companylink">Jefferies &amp; Co</span>. in New York. "There's a very legitimate concern that Washington is pushing the envelope too far in terms of the U.S.'s ability to carry all this debt."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year alone, the Treasury Dept. is expected to sell some $1.6 trillion in debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That -- and heftier issuance of longer-maturity Treasurys -- has helped to widen the gap between short- and long-term yields--the so-called yield curve. The benchmark yield curve, the gap between the two- and 10-year notes, has been steepening since late last year, hitting a historically steep level in February of 294.9 basis points, according to Tullett Prebon data. Wednesday afternoon, it was at 273 basis points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McCarthy expects the curve to push out even further by the end of the year, out to around 350 basis points, as the Fed keeps interest rates low while the federal government continues to issue large amounts of long-term debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's another worry that could grip the markets later in the year: The Fed's withdrawal of the liquidity it pumped into the financial system may not be as smooth as hoped for. Leaving the liquidity in the market, however, could fuel inflation -- which would hit long-dated government securities as rising prices eat into their fixed returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Later this year, people could get more unsettled," Mr. McCarthy said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed may have little room to move on the interest-rate front, particularly given the housing market's persistent weakness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market seems to have forgotten that housing is the key in a recovery, and that's still down," said Kevin Giddis, head of fixed income trading at Morgan Keegan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week's data have provided a timely reminder: both existing and new home sales fell, with annual new home sales hitting a record low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With yields still relatively low despite Wednesday's move, investors are looking outside the Treasury market for better returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Highly rated companies and even low-rated states are providing plenty of competition: The yield on California's 30-year bond is expected to be more than 7% -- compared with the long bond's 4.721% yield. <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span>'s 30-year offering was launched at 95 basis points over Treasurys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You're seeing the supply pressures weigh on the market, and you have a search for yield going on," said Sean Simko, head of SEI fixed income management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corporate issuance has been strong so far in March -- and that's also weighing on the government bond market as companies lock in rates ahead of the sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government has one more sale this week, on Thursday -- a $32 billion offering of seven-year securities. Not surprisingly, the seven-year yield moved the most on Wednesday, adding 17 basis points, to 3.276%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">&nbsp;That could attract buyers, of course, but few think the Treasury market's woes are over.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HONG KONG -- Asian markets ended mostly higher Wednesday, with strong corporate earnings boosting Hong Kong and Chinese stocks, while Nintendo surged in Tokyo on plans to release a new game console.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tone for the markets was set by strong overnight gains on Wall Street that pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average to its highest close since Sept. 26, 2008, after a smaller-than-expected drop in U.S. existing home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Markets are saying they think the solid recovery in the U.S. manufacturing sector [and elsewhere for that matter] will continue and we are very much on board with that expectation," said David Carbon at DBS Group in Singapore.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest data on the housing market underscored its fragility as the overall economy recovers and showed that a glut of homes for sale and a wave of foreclosures and fire sales are holding down housing prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes fell 0.6% in February from a month earlier to a seasonally a</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">djusted annual rate of 5.02 million, the National Association of Realtors said. Severe winter weather hurt sales in February. In December and January, sales suffered from a surge in sales in the autumn as buyers moved to take advantage of an expiring tax credit, that since has been extended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The expiration of that tax credit [and severe winter weather] has caused home sales to crash," Insight Economics' Steven Wood wrote in a research note. "Because the tax credit has been extended and expanded, there should be a recovery in sales over the next two months." The new tax break covers sales through April 30 that close before July 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for an existing home was $165,100 in February, down 1.8% from February 2009, the Realtors said. Distressed homes, generally sold at discount, accounted for 35% of sales last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report Tuesday from <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> showed that house prices fell 0.6% in January and December's numbers were softer than previously reported. The FHFA index -- which tracks the prices of the same houses over time, but only those sold to or guaranteed by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> or the Federal Home Loan Banks -- is 13.2% below its April 2007 peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories of existing homes increased 9.5% at the end of the month to 3.59 million available for sale, the Realtors said. That represented a 8.6-month supply at the current sales pace, compared with a 7.8-month supply in January.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Tamara Audi </div><div>1005 words</div><div>20 March 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOS ANGELES -- This city has complicated feelings about big signs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some people hate the signs -- known as "mega-graphics" -- that wrap advertisements around buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many of those same folks love the sign that spells "Hollywood" in white, 45-foot-high letters in the hills above the city. One group is trying to raise $12.5 million to keep developers from building houses nearby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So when SkyTag Inc., a Beverly Hills-based company that owns some of the mega-graphics, offered the money needed to buy and preserve land around the Hollywood sign, it touched off debate about what price the city is willing to pay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Chicago investment group owns the 138-acre parcel and they could build homes around the iconic sign or sell the land to a developer. Efforts to buy the land with public funds and donations remains $3 million short, with just weeks before expiration of their purchase option.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SkyTag's offer appears to have strings attached. The company is fighting the city in court to continue displaying its multi-story mega-graphics. SkyTag's lawyer emailed several city council members and Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa with an offer to present their proposal to the city. But city council members said they were not interested.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If it's supposed to be a trade for visual blight in one part of the city in return for protecting another, he's not interested in that kind of trade-off," said Julie Wong, a spokeswoman for city council President Eric Garcetti.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SkyTag owner Mike McNeilly said he grew up underneath the Hollywood sign. "I want to see the land around it preserved," he said. He asked that in return for his proposed gift, the city treat his mega-signs with "fairness."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He pointed out the Hollywood sign also started out as a giant advertisement. It originally read "Hollywoodland" when it was erected in 1923, and was intended to lure potential real-estate buyers. "It's a real-estate sign, and it's funny that it's become our icon," said Mr. McNeilly. "At the end of the day, we're talking about a giant sign on a hill and a giant sign on the street."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Large commercial signs have become a touchy political issue here. Last year, the city issued an all-out ban on mega-graphics, billboards and electronic billboards. Last month, the city filed a civil suit against 27 sign installers and property owners the city claimed erected signs after the ban.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the ban, SkyTag had sued the city over the constitutionality of its old sign ordinance, which the company alleged did not treat sign owners equally. The company won a federal court injunction that allowed some companies, including SkyTag, to keep mega-signs posted before the ban and to continue selling the ad space. The city has appealed the federal court decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past, local officials have been accused of enjoying cozy relationships with the billboard industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many residents see no contradiction in embracing the city's original mega sign while rejecting its modern-day equivalent. Putting up houses around the Hollywood sign "would be sacrilege," says Greg Williams, a local historian and puppeteer. "Would you want to put a super high sky-scraper next to the Eiffel Tower? It's the same thing. This is like our Eiffel Tower."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Williams is aghast at the modern-day signs that adorns the city. "They've gotten way out of hand," he says. "It's just tackier than anything."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city is pairing with the Trust for Public Land, a non-profit group that helps local governments buy and preserve historic sites. The group helped buy the land around Walden Pond, outside Boston, and the school in Topeka, Kansas, at the center of the landmark Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trust has secured $9.5 million in funding so far, including a $3.1 million gift from a group of Hollywood heavy hitters and $4 million from state and city bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the effort is about $3 million short of the $12.5 million needed to buy the land and pay legal expenses. The Trust has a year-long option to purchase the 138-acre parcel that ends April 14.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saving the Hollywood sign has become a local cause celebre among the famous and the unknown. Tom Hanks chipped in; 12-year-old Emily Sender helped raise $1,800 at a bake sale with her berry-yogurt pies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Tiffany &amp;Co</span>. Foundation President Fernanda Kellogg hiked to the top of the Cahuenga Peak, within a few feet of the famous letters. "It was awesome," she said. "You have all of Los Angeles at your feet." After the hike, Ms. Kellogg's foundation donated $1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elizabeth Taylor posted a message on a Web site run by the Trust for Public Land: "The Hollywood Sign is a universal representation of the magic of our cinematic tradition and the romance of the film and entertainment communities."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The land behind the sign was once owned by Howard Hughes, who intended to build a hilltop retreat for his girlfriend at the time, Ginger Rogers. She reportedly didn't want to live there, and the house was never built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The land sat for decades as part of Mr. Hughes' estate, and many assumed it was part of the vast, adjacent Griffith Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chicago-based Fox River Financial Resources, a private investment group, purchased the land in 2002 from the Hughes estate for $1.6 million. The land is zoned for four homes that could be built to the left of the "H" in the sign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fox River put the land up for sale for $22 million, but last year agreed to sell it to the Trust for $11.7 million under the option that expires next month.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Cari Tuna </div><div>688 words</div><div>19 March 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The California housing market is showing more signs of stabilization -- at least for now -- as sales of bank-owned and bargain-basement homes in inland areas partially give way to sales of costlier homes toward the coast, according to a new report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California's median home price rose 11.2% in February from February 2009, although home sales in the state slipped for the second consecutive month compared with a year earlier, according to a report released Thursday by MDA <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>, a La Jolla, Calif., housing-data provider.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home price increased to $249,000 in February from $224,000 a year earlier, <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> said. The median price rose 0.8% from January 2010. Home sales in the state fell 3.8% in February from a year earlier to 28,111 sales, but were up 0.9% from January 2010, <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The San Francisco Bay Area's median home price rose 20% from February 2009 to $354,000, while home sales fell from year-earlier levels for the second straight month. In Southern California, the median home price rose 10% to $275,000, led by a 13% rise in San Diego, while the number of home sales rose from year-earlier levels for the 20th consecutive month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in the statewide median price -- the biggest year-over-year jump since March 2006 -- partially reflected a shift in the types of homes being sold in the state, as fewer foreclosures and stiff competition for bargains ate up inventory at the market's lower end, said <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> analyst Andrew LePage. "There has been a shift in what's selling and what's not selling," Mr. LePage said. "The high end has woken up, whereas it was comatose a year ago."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But prices are "still way below any peak we saw two or three years back," he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The change can be seen in the experience of Rich Barbaria of Campbell, Calif. After searching on and off for a year, including bidding unsuccessfully on several bank-owned homes, the 31-year-old mechanical engineer last month offered $455,000 for a three-bedroom, two-bathroom house in Morgan Hill, a city in southern Santa Clara County. The sale closed this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I finally found something in a better area than I was expecting," said Mr. Barbaria, who added that he bought the home from its owners and faced no competing bids. But he thinks he spent slightly more than he would have last year when home prices hit bottom. Indeed, Santa Clara County's median home price rose to $460,000 in February, up 12.5% from a year earlier, <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the stabilization in home prices, housing experts said, the hard-hit state isn't out of the woods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The rebound in prices is artificial," boosted by federal and state efforts to stimulate demand among buyers and stem foreclosures, said Sam Khater, a senior economist at First American CoreLogic, a Santa Ana, Calif., research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the percentage of existing homes sold last month that had been foreclosed on in the prior year fell to 44.3% from an all-time high of 58.8% in February 2009, it edged up from 43.8% in January 2010, <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A similar trend is playing out across the U.S., where the supply of foreclosed homes that banks need to sell is rising again, signaling further downward pressure on home prices in some parts of the country. Mortgage analysts at <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span> in New York estimated that banks and mortgage investors held a total of 645,800 foreclosed homes in January, up 4.6% from 617,286 a month earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think that the market is going to struggle for some time," said Mr. Khater, who noted that California's unemployment rate was 12.5% in January. "You've got quite a bit of road to go before you see the light."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Former Avon Chief</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sells for $8.5 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Preston, who ran <span class="companylink">Avon Products</span> from 1988 to 1998, has sold his 398-acre property in Kent, Conn., for $8.5 million; the estate had previously been offered for around $14 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Balestra Capital acted as an intermediary for the buyer, a family that's a client of the firm. The property has a roughly 8,500-square-foot, Colonial-style home with five bedrooms and a stone patio. There's also a tennis court, pool house and barns, plus hundreds of wooded and open acres with views of mountains. The western part of the property spills into New York state. Mr. Preston, who held the posts of chairman and chief executive at the direct cosmetics seller, declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residents of this area 100 miles north of Manhattan include Oscar and Annette de la Renta. Judith Perkins of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span> represented Mr. Preston, and Joseph Lorino of Klemm Real Estate, the buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Walter Cronkite's Apartment</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The late Walter Cronkite's apartment, close to the United Nations complex in New York, has sold for $2.5 million, about 17% less than the original asking price of just under $3 million in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 38th-floor co-operative unit, listed after the veteran CBS anchor died in July at age 92, has views of the East River and of the Chrysler and Empire State buildings. The two-bedroom space was converted from a four-bedroom and has a living-and-dining area measuring 32 by 40 feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cronkite regularly watched Yankees games and other sports matches in a bedroom-turned-library, says his companion Joanna Simon, who works for Fox Residential Group and listed the property. "At 6:30 he always turned to CBS."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyer is a Citibank executive whose identity couldn't be learned. Ms. Simon also represented the buyer and in 1997 had sold the apartment to Mr. Cronkite and his wife, Betsy, who died in 2005. The sister of singer Carly Simon and a daughter of Simon &amp;Schuster co-founder Richard Simon, Ms. Simon was Mr. Cronkite's companion in the last years of his life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More Ranch Acres for Less</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 250,000-acre ranch in New Mexico first listed in 2007 for $115 million is now available for $83 million -- with an additional 40,000 acres thrown in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Called the Bell Ranch for a bell-shaped butte on the land, the property is a working cattle ranch 150 miles east of Santa Fe. In 1970, Illinois businessman William N. Lane bought the land, which passed on to his children when he died in 1978. They've lost interest in ranch ownership and are planning their estates, said listing agent Patrick Bates, of Bates Sanders Swan Land Co.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property -- which was large enough to have its own ZIP Code at one point -- includes a more than 10,000-square-foot house with eight bedrooms, a pool, an airstrip and a tennis court. The Canadian River runs through part of the ranch, which also has about 13 miles of frontage on Lake Conchas.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Want a Short Sale? Best to Wait; A new government program aimed to speed up these notoriously sluggish transactions goes into effect on April 5, increasing your chances of negotiating a distressed-property bargain.</span>
</div><div class="author">By June Fletcher   </div><div>611 words</div><div>19 March 2010</div><div>10:21</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: I am looking to buy my first home, and it seems like short-sales are priced much lower than regular sales. Are these prices negotiable, or are they the bottom line that lenders will accept?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allentown, Pa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: Many lenders negotiate prices for short-sales, in which the seller is offering the home for less than is owed on the mortgage. But traditionally the only way you could find out was to submit a below-list offer and wait—often for many months—for a response. If the bank made a counter-offer, you knew you were in the ballpark; if they didn't respond at all, you were too low. By then, you may have lost all interest in buying the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news is, on April 5, this frustrating system will change at least for some buyers and sellers. That's when the federal government will begin to provide financial incentives to lenders to do more short sales. The rules also help standardize the process, so your chances of negotiating a distressed-property bargain will increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the old practices, when a financially-distressed seller brought a potential buyer who was offering less than the amount owed on the loan, the bank would order an appraisal or broker's price opinion (BPO) and then decide whether the offer was acceptable. Under the new federal rules, banks will order a BPO before the property is listed for sale, and will share information on the minimum net proceeds they're willing to accept with the sellers. If they then bring in a buyer whose offer is equal to or greater than this pre-approved amount, the lender must accept it within 10 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all sellers are eligible for this program, called Home Affordable Foreclosure Alternatives (HAFA) (for the requirements see Help for America's Homeowner's Supplemental Directive 09-09[https://www.hmpadmin.com/portal/docs/hamp_servicer/sd0909.pdf]). But since the process is likely to go so much smoother for those who buy and sell under HAFA, I suggest you wait a bit until the program goes into effect and concentrate on finding these "pre-approved" deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, when you do find a property you like, you may not be the only person bidding on it. To improve your chances of winning, make sure your offer is "clean," with as few contingencies as possible (though I would never forego a home inspection). Include tax and credit records, and a mortgage pre-approval letter. If you can afford to pay cash, that will put you in an even stronger bargaining position.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, in your eagerness to win the property, don't forget that distressed properties often come with added financial burdens. Although under HAFA, the seller is supposed to provide clear title, to protect yourself your, your contract must make it clear that you will not be responsible for any of the seller's unpaid property taxes, liens or second trusts. Also, cash-strapped homeowners often stop paying taxes and homeowners' association fees during the time between when the house is listed and the deal is closed. To make sure that you're not on the hook for these expenses, Leonard P. Baron, professor of finance at San Diego State University, recommends that you ask that the bank escrow at least six months worth of taxes and HOA fees, to cover any potential shortfall.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Cari Tuna   </div><div>676 words</div><div>19 March 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The California housing market is showing more signs of stabilization—at least for now—as sales of bank-owned and bargain-basement homes in inland areas partially give way to sales of costlier homes toward the coast, according to a new report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California's median home price rose 11.2% in February from February 2009, although home sales in the state slipped for the second consecutive month compared with a year earlier, according to a report released Thursday by MDA <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>, a La Jolla, Calif., housing-data provider.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home price increased to $249,000 in February from $224,000 a year earlier, <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> said. The median price rose 0.8% from January 2010. Home sales in the state fell 3.8% in February from a year earlier to 28,111 sales, but were up 0.9% from January 2010, <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The San Francisco Bay Area's median home price rose 20% from February 2009 to $354,000, while home sales fell from year-earlier levels for the second straight month. In Southern California, the median home price rose 10% to $275,000, led by a 13% rise in San Diego, while the number of home sales rose from year-earlier levels for the 20th consecutive month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in the statewide median price—the biggest year-over-year jump since March 2006—partially reflected a shift in the types of homes being sold in the state, as fewer foreclosures and stiff competition for bargains ate up inventory at the market's lower end, said <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> analyst Andrew LePage. "There has been a shift in what's selling and what's not selling," Mr. LePage said. "The high end has woken up, whereas it was comatose a year ago."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But prices are "still way below any peak we saw two or three years back," he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The change can be seen in the experience of Rich Barbaria of Campbell, Calif. After searching on and off for a year, including bidding unsuccessfully on several bank-owned homes, the 31-year-old mechanical engineer last month offered $455,000 for a three-bedroom, two-bathroom house in Morgan Hill, a city in southern Santa Clara County. The sale closed this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I finally found something in a better area than I was expecting," said Mr. Barbaria, who added that he bought the home from its owners and faced no competing bids. But he thinks he spent slightly more than he would have last year when home prices hit bottom. Indeed, Santa Clara County's median home price rose to $460,000 in February, up 12.5% from a year earlier, <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the stabilization in home prices, housing experts said, the hard-hit state isn't out of the woods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The rebound in prices is artificial," boosted by federal and state efforts to stimulate demand among buyers and stem foreclosures, said Sam Khater, a senior economist at First American <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>, a Santa Ana, Calif., research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the percentage of existing homes sold last month that had been foreclosed on in the prior year fell to 44.3% from an all-time high of 58.8% in February 2009, it edged up from 43.8% in January 2010, <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, default notices, the first step in the foreclosure process, jumped 19.7% in February from January, though they were down 37.7% from February 2009, according to a report released earlier this month by research firm ForeclosureRadar.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think that the market is going to struggle for some time," said Mr. Khater, who noted that California's unemployment rate was 12.5% in January and the percentage of California mortgage holders who were at least 90 days late on payments increased to 11.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You've got quite a bit of road to go before you see the light."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Preston, who ran <span class="companylink">Avon Products</span> from 1988 to 1998, has sold his 398-acre property in Kent, Conn., for $8.5 million; the estate had previously been offered for around $14 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Balestra Capital acted as an intermediary for the buyer, a family that's a client of the firm. The property has a roughly 8,500-square-foot, Colonial-style home with five bedrooms and a stone patio. There's also a tennis court, pool house and barns, plus hundreds of wooded and open acres with views of mountains. The western part of the property spills into New York state. Mr. Preston, who held the posts of chairman and chief executive at the direct cosmetics seller, declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residents of this area 100 miles north of Manhattan include Oscar and Annette de la Renta. Judith Perkins of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span> represented Mr. Preston, and Joseph Lorino of Klemm Real Estate, the buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Walter Cronkite's Apartment</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The late Walter Cronkite's apartment, close to the United Nations complex in New York, has sold for $2.5 million, about 17% less than the original asking price of just under $3 million in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 38th-floor co-operative unit, listed after the veteran CBS anchor died in July at age 92, has views of the East River and of the Chrysler and Empire State buildings. The two-bedroom space was converted from a four-bedroom and has a living-and-dining area measuring 32 by 40 feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cronkite regularly watched Yankees games and other sports matches in a bedroom-turned-library, says his companion Joanna Simon , who works for Fox Residential Group and listed the property. "At 6:30 he always turned to CBS."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyer is a Citibank executive whose identity couldn't be learned. Ms. Simon also represented the buyer and in 1997 had sold the apartment to Mr. Cronkite and his wife, Betsy, who died in 2005. The sister of singer Carly Simon and a daughter of Simon &amp; Schuster co-founder Richard Simon, Ms. Simon was Mr. Cronkite's companion in the last years of his life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More Ranch Acres for Less</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 250,000-acre ranch in New Mexico first listed in 2007 for $115 million is now available for $83 million—with an additional 40,000 acres thrown in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Called the Bell Ranch for a bell-shaped butte on the land, the property is a working cattle ranch 150 miles east of Santa Fe. In 1970, Illinois businessman William N. Lane bought the land, which passed on to his children when he died in 1978. They've lost interest in ranch ownership and are planning their estates, said listing agent Patrick Bates, of Bates Sanders Swan Land Co.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property—which was large enough to have its own ZIP Code at one point—includes a more than 10,000-square-foot house with eight bedrooms, a pool, an airstrip and a tennis court. The Canadian River runs through part of the ranch, which also has about 13 miles of frontage on Lake Conchas.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anton Troianovski and Nick Timiraos </div><div>1041 words</div><div>19 March 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>29</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hot Sulphur Springs, Colo. -- Like many Americans, Jon and Laura Hagar are searching for a lender to refinance their home loan. But banks are leery of the Hagars. Their rural Colorado house is made of 17,000 old tires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A niche mortgage mess is brewing in homes made of earth, tires, concrete and trash. Environmentally minded people built them, hoping to conserve energy and to re-use what might otherwise wind up in a landfill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such sentiments in some cases have been no match for the new resolve of the banking industry in the wake of the housing bust. Banks have become much pickier about examining sales of comparable homes, in deciding whether and how much to lend. Owners of odd homes can be out of luck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hagars built their 2,700-square-foot house by stacking tire bales -- 1.5-meter-wide fblocks of compressed tires -- to form the exterior walls. They plugged gaps between the bales with cans, bottles, plastic plates, and other junk and moved in toward the end of 2008. "We lovingly call it the trash house," Ms. Hagar says. The Hagars covered up all that trash with concrete, clay and stucco and installed south-facing windows to capture light, heat and views of the snowy slopes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To pay for it, the Hagars in 2007 took out a $240,000 line of credit from Red Rocks Credit Union in suburban Denver. In the old days of easier credit, appraiser Lori Slota couldn't find another tire-bale home that had recently sold but said the house would be valued at $500,000 when complete, citing the listing of a straw-bale home as well as other houses in the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, with the home finally finished and interest rates at record lows, the Hagars started trying to refinance into a long-term, fixed-rate mortgage. But in February 2009, they got the bad news from loan officer Bill Schimel, who wrote in an email, "I think we have really hit a brick wall here." So far as anyone can tell, no home made from tire bales has sold recently in the state of Colorado. Lenders have been telling the Hagars they can't value the property and won't give them a regular mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Getting financing for unusual homes has never been easy. Near Granby, Colo., Richard Messer opted not to look for a conventional mortgage because there was nothing conventional about what's inside his walls: 50 tons of paper Coors beer packaging used as insulation. Mr. Messer got a $60,000 loan from friends to help pay for it. "The problem for anyone trying to do a unique house is financing," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wayne Bryant, a 56-year-old steamfitter, spent much of last year looking for a way to refinance a $417,000 construction loan on his underground house high in the San Juan Mountains in southwest Colorado. The first appraiser to examine his property didn't even come down from Denver to look at it, saying he had made a few phone calls and determined that there were no comparable transactions in the area, Mr. Bryant says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At times, Mr. Bryant says, he and his wife feared they would lose their home. (Their construction lender, Fred Arnold of Owner Builder Loan Services says he foreclosed on several log homes in 2009 when borrowers couldn't refinance.) Eventually, the <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo &amp;Co</span>. branch in nearby Durango obtained an acceptable appraisal and agreed to give the Bryants a mortgage. "People like us that want to build these types of homes -- we're basically at the mercy of the mortgage companies," Mr. Bryant says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brad Blackwell, <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>'s national sales manager for Western markets, said lenders are scrutinizing home values much more closely than in years past before they make a loan -- making it harder for people in unusual properties to get mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's simply a fact of the mortgage lending environment in general that determining value on a property is more important than ever today," Mr. Blackwell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Complicating matters, government-backed mortgage-finance giants <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> adopted a new code of conduct for appraisers last spring. In the past, mortgage brokers could call on appraisers who had developed a niche by tracking oddball homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new code bars mortgage brokers and real-estate agents from any role in selecting appraisers. During the go-go years, appraisers frequently complained that they were being pressured by brokers to inflate estimates. The rules have a wide reach because Fannie and Freddie account for more than 70% of the mortgage market today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pagosa Springs, Colo. mortgage broker Connie Giffin is one casualty. During the boom, she raked in as much as $295,000 a year just for arranging financing for what she calls earth-friendly homes. She helped appraisers value unusual homes by guiding them to comparable properties in a database she kept. To finance a seven-bedroom dome-shaped house in Yuma, Ariz., Ms. Giffin pointed the appraiser to domes around the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the new rules, Ms. Giffin is no longer allowed to work with appraisers for loans that may be bought by Fannie or Freddie. Last year, her total was $16,000, and this year, Ms. Giffin says she is pretty much out of business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hagars are still hoping. Don Arkell, a vice president at Red Rocks, says he is looking for a way to refinance their loan and is still testing the secondary mortgage market. He worries that the house is so unusual that he won't be able to sell the loan to investors, meaning the credit union would have to keep the loan on its own books. With regulators concerned about the health of small banks, Red Rocks is focusing on making loans that can be easily sold should it need to raise cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is pretty bleak out there for people in properties that are hard to value," he says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a brief filed Tuesday with the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, a 120-year-old organization that represents state regulators, said utility ratepayers have paid $17 billion into a federal waste fund, and that terminating the licensing process for Yucca Mountain would put the process of finding permanent storage "back to square one."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $10.7 billion budget gap for the 2011 fiscal year starting on July 1 ranks as the largest per taxpayer of any state and is equal to more than one-third of New Jersey's budget, Rich Bagger, Mr. Christie's chief of staff, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his first full-year budget address since taking office in January, the Republican governor proposed closing the projected deficit by deferring $3 billion of public pension payments, limiting increases in school aid by $1.7 billion, and cutting public-transit subsidies by $272 million.</p>

Mr. Paterson reportedly declined those tickets, but told the Yankees he'd take them when they inevitably reach the World Series.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Public report cards are coming to the restaurant capital of the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New York City Board of Health voted Tuesday to require all restaurants in the five boroughs to display a placard with a letter grade that summarizes the results of the city's food-safety inspections. Restaurants -- from three-star Michelin hot spots to no-frills neighborhood diners -- must begin posting their inspection grades in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city's Health Department currently posts restaurant inspection reports on its Web site. Those reports include a numerical score reflecting the severity of violations. Now, patrons will no longer need to go online to assess a restaurant's sanitary conditions, and a letter grade will be easier to understand than a numerical score, officials said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opponents of the new system argue that the grade represents a mere snapshot in time. Restaurants can fix violations immediately, but a bad grade could be displayed for months. "It really provides a scarlet letter for that restaurant," said Andrew Rigie, director of operations for the New York City chapter of the New York State Restaurant Association.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Winter storms slowed new home construction in February, the latest blow for a housing market that remains strained by foreclosures and tight credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts tumbled 5.9% in February from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 575,000, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family home starts decreased 0.6% from the prior month to 499,000, while ground-breakings on apartments with two or more units slid 30.3% to 76,000. Within the multifamily category, starts of homes with five or more units registered their biggest drop since January 1994, falling 43.1% to a 58,000 annual rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, a Labor Department report showed U.S. import prices in February posted their first monthly drop since July 2009, dragged down by lower fuel prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices of goods imported into the U.S. dropped by 0.3% last month, after increasing a revised 1.3% in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers show the threat of inflation remains minimal, leaving the U.S. Federal Reserve considerable leeway to continue priming the economy with near-zero interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Import prices were up 11.2% for the year ended in February. The big year-over-year increase is largely a function of oil prices, which have risen considerably since the depth of the recession last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Excluding fuel prices, import prices rose 0.2% in February. Food prices edged down 0.1%, the first drop since July 2009, largely on lower prices for vegetable and food oils.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday's housing data portray a construction market that has bottomed out, but remains under severe stress, economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weather played a prominent role in February's drop, with hefty month-over-month declines in the storm-battered Northeast and South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits -- an indicator of future construction that is less susceptible to weather than housing starts -- fell 1.6% in February from January, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 622,000.

</div><div class="author">By Conor Dougherty                And Tom Barkley   </div><div>436 words</div><div>16 March 2010</div><div>19:20</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Winter storms slowed new home construction in February, the latest blow for a housing market that remains strained by foreclosures and tight credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts tumbled 5.9% in February from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 575,000, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family home starts decreased 0.6% from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 499,000, while ground-breakings on apartments with two or more units slid 30.3% to 76,000. Within the multifamily category, starts of homes with five or more units registered their biggest drop since January 1994, falling 43.1% to a 58,000 annual rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, a Labor Department report showed U.S. import prices in February posted their first monthly drop since July 2009, dragged down by lower fuel prices. Prices of goods imported into the U.S. dropped by 0.3% last month, after increasing a revised 1.3% in January. The numbers show the threat of inflation remains minimal, leaving the U.S. Federal Reserve considerable leeway to continue priming the economy with near-zero interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Import prices were up 11.2% for the year ended in February. The big year-over-year increase is largely a function of oil prices, which have risen considerably since the depth of the recession last year. Excluding fuel prices, import prices rose 0.2% in February. Food prices edged down 0.1%, the first drop since July 2009, largely on lower prices for vegetable and food oils.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday's housing data portray a construction market that has bottomed out, but remains under severe stress, economists say. Weather played a big role in February's drop, with hefty month-over-month declines in the storm-battered Northeast and South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits—an indicator of future construction that is less susceptible to weather than housing starts—fell 1.6% in February from January, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 622,000. That is 11.3% above year-earlier levels, but still extremely low by historical standards. "We've gotten to the bottom, but there is little evidence of demand for a lasting recovery to take form," said Tim Quinlan, an economist at <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo Securities</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Home Builders on Monday reported U.S. home-builder confidence fell a fourth time in six months, slipping to 15 in March from 17.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bad news can sometimes be reason to cheer, at least when it comes to housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This may not be immediately apparent to investors focusing on the downbeat message that lower housing starts imply for construction and other real-estate-related industries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department is expected to say Tuesday that the pace of new-home construction fell roughly 5% in February to 563,000 units at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the wider positive for stocks and the economy is that falling housing starts are a longer-term palliative for the bloated housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of home building has already fallen sharply, to a low of 488,000 units last April from a peak of nearly 2.3 million in mid-2006. That has helped cut excess inventory of new homes, which has fallen to its lowest level since 1971.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite that, more thinning is needed. While new homes for sale shrank to 234,000 in January, this is dwarfed by the 3.25 million existing homes also on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Add to this an additional 5 million to 5.5 million properties estimated to be in the late stages of delinquency or early stages of foreclosure. Little wonder then that home builders' confidence sank in March to a level of 15 from 17 the previous month, according to a trade-group survey. Their confidence has been below the 50 level, which signals sales improvement, since April 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fortunately, a number of factors are working to keep this "shadow inventory" from hitting all at once. These include government loan-modification and foreclosure-prevention efforts, as well as a rising number of bank-approved short-sales which help clear the market gradually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With fears of a housing "double-dip' receding, the government plans to remove some emergency props.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve is expected to say Tuesday, following its one-day rate setting meeting, that its program of buying $1.25 trillion in mortgage-backed securities will wind down this month as anticipated. The Obama administration, meanwhile, isn't expected to extend its home-buyer tax-credit program again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, it is far too early to say that housing is ready to rebound. Until that happens, it is better for everyone if home builders aren't feeding the glut.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates dropped slightly this week, with the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaging 4.95% in <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>'s weekly survey of mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mortgage averaged 4.97% last week and 5.03% a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results come as recovery in the U.S. housing market has weakened in recent months. Demand for new and used homes, after strengthening earlier last year, has dropped because of cold weather and continuing high levels of joblessness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales unexpectedly hit a record low in January, while existing-home sales also slumped. The National Association of Realtors' index for pending sales of previously owned homes, an indicator of sales to come, fell as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 15-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 4.32% for the week ending March 11, down from 4.33% last week and 4.64% a year ago. Five-year Treasury-indexed hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages averaged 4.05%, down from 4.11% last week and 4.99% a year ago. And 1-year Treasury-indexed ARMs averaged 4.22%, down from 4.27% last week and 4.80% a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"During a light week of mixed economic reports, mortgage rates eased somewhat," said Frank Nothaft, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> vice president and chief economist. "Pending existing home sales fell 7.6% in January, well below the market consensus of a 1% gain."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Lingling Wei </div><div>890 words</div><div>10 March 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The estate of real-estate baroness Leona Helmsley has signed a deal to sell one of its prime Manhattan hotels for about $170 million, in a sign that investor appetite is keen for trophy assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale of the Helmsley Carlton House to a venture of private-equity firm <span class="companylink">Angelo, Gordon &amp;Co</span>. and Extell Development Co. also marks the beginning of the final act of the Helmsley saga in which the properties accumulated over four decades by the late Harry Helmsley are going to be sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mrs. Helmsley, who inherited the empire, died in August 2007, her estate began moving to sell properties. But those plans were shelved when the credit crunch and recession unhinged the commercial real-estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While that sector is still suffering from the downturn, a growing volume of distressed property and trophy assets are attracting attention from investors who have accumulated large war chests in hopes of taking advantage of market woes. The buyer of the Carlton House, <span class="companylink">Angelo Gordon</span>, raised a total of $2 billion in 2006 and 2007 and had spent only 25% of that capital until mid-2009, when the firm began buying again, according to an investor in its funds. Located in the heart of the tony Madison Avenue shopping district, the retail space in Carlton House is among the most valuable in the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new owner plans to convert the upper floors into apartments. Condominiums and co-op apartments on Manhattan's Upper East Side still fetch high prices although they, too, have suffered from the housing collapse. The new owner also plans to double the retail space to take advantage of the prime location.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market is very ready for quality products," said Darcy Stacom, vice chairman at brokerage <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis Inc</span>. who represented the Helmsley estate in the deal. Ms. Stacom said in an interview Tuesday that the Carton House attracted interest from more than 200 investor groups, and about a dozen of them made the final round of bidding for the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People are extremely frustrated," she said, referring to investors who have raised money to do deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Stacom declined to identify others eyeing the property but people familiar with the matter say they included a Who's Who of New York real estate. Among them: New York developer Harry Macklowe, who teamed up with private-equity firm <span class="companylink">Fortress Investment Group LLC</span>; Barry Sternlicht's Starwood Capital; Arthur and William Zeckendorf; a venture of Stanley Chera and Jacob Safra; and developer Daniel Brodsky. Mr. Chera confirmed his interest in the property. The other investors declined to comment or couldn't be reached.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People familiar with the property say the price that the <span class="companylink">Angelo Gordon</span> group is paying is much less than a buyer would have paid at the market's peak in 2007, when it likely would have gone for over $200 million. Nevertheless, it is higher than what Mrs. Helmsley's estate hoped to get, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyers would need to rent the retail space for $650 a square foot and sell apartments for at least $2,000 a square foot for their investment to pay off. "The price is within reason for such an excellent asset," said Joseph Tuchman, director of acquisitions, at the Hakim Organization, one of the bidders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Helmsley's estate, which was valued at $5 billion, is expected to begin selling other properties that Mr. Helmsley acquired or developed. Its holdings include the <span class="companylink">Park Lane Hotel</span>, the New York Helmsley, a stake in the Empire State Building and the Sandcastle Hotel in Sarasota, Fla. The <span class="companylink">Park Lane Hotel</span>, which overlooks Manhattan's Central Park, was on the market in 2008, only to be pulled off as the financial crisis intensified.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Helmsley left the bulk of her fortune to the Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust. She also bequeathed $12 million to her dog, Trouble, and comparatively little to her closest relatives. A Manhattan judge in 2008 reduced Trouble's inheritance to $2 million. The Maltese poodle lives in the Sandcastle Hotel and her security alone costs the estate about $100,000 a year, according to published reports. "Trouble is no trouble. She's alive, well and thriving," said Howard Rubenstein, a spokesman for the estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deal volume is increasing as signs increase that values have stabilized. According to Real Capital, the amount of investment sales increased to $18.8 billion in the fourth quarter from only $10.4 billion in the first quarter of 2009. Still, that figure remains a fraction of the $145 billion seen in the first quarter of 2007, the market peak. The firm estimates that about $20.9 billion of property was brought to the market this quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is a good time to execute a sales plan, as there are fewer items on the shelf for sale, and yet assets still trade at big discounts to replacement costs as well as can offer buyers a discount from the peak pricing in 2007," says Douglas Harmon, a senior managing director at Eastdil Secured.</p>

Rather than being moneymakers -- brokers tend to offer their apps for free -- the apps are seen as a tool to make the home-buying process easier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't think it's driving revenue for us, but it's making customers happier," says Glenn Kelman, chief executive of <span class="companylink">Redfin Corp</span>., a Seattle-based broker that operates in nine states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the apps' functions -- such as listing which nearby homes are for sale and which have sold recently, then fetching pricing and other data -- have long been available via traditional Web sites. But the apps combine those functions with smart phones' global-positioning technology, so that users can get information on their immediate surroundings without having to type the address or zip code.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's like having your laptop with you on the ride," says Rachel Ashby, a marketing manager in Seattle who is using Redfin's app in her search for a house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jon Mirmelli, a real-estate investor in Scottsdale, Ariz., got an email last week informing him that a home in Phoenix was about to be put up for auction at a minimum bid of $668,000. With a few taps on his iPhone, he got details on the size of the house, a map and then panoramic photos of the relevant street. The images showed an older home that likely needed a lot of work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Within a minute, I had enough information to say it's not worth driving" 25 miles to inspect the home, says Mr. Mirmelli, who also occasionally uses an app from <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span> to get estimates of home values and other data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apps have become more than "just a cool little novelty," says Myron Lo, vice president of innovation at ZipRealty Inc. The Emeryville, Calif.-based real-estate broker provides services in 22 states and offers a free app that includes home listings, value estimates and other data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow, a Seattle-based provider of real-estate information, says people are looking up two million homes a month on its free app, which has been downloaded 970,000 times. "We were blown away by how much usage it gets," a spokeswoman says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Move Inc</span>. offers a free Realtor.com home-search app with listings and open-house information, among other things. Smarter Agent LLC also has a home-search app, as do more and more real-estate brokers, including the Coldwell Banker and Better Homes and Gardens real-estate chains, and <span class="companylink">Corcoran Group</span>, which operates in New York City and South Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some apps not designed for real-estate searches may nonetheless be useful in that quest. InnovationGeo LLC has a series of local-crime apps under the Are You Safe brand. These apps, which cost 99 cents apiece, tell you what sorts of crimes and how many of them have occurred near your location. As you move from an area deemed relatively safe into one with more crime, the app's meter shifts from green to red.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've created a Geiger counter for crime," says Benjamin Mokotoff, who helped create the app for InnovationGeo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, that service is available for only a few cities: Washington, Atlanta, Sacramento, Indianapolis and Milwaukee. But the company says it is trying to add more cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The free Walk Score app, from Front Seat LLC in Seattle, rates neighborhoods based on the ease of walking to shops, restaurants and other public places. The free EveryBlock app, produced by EveryBlock LLC, provides news, crime information, real-estate listings and foreclosure data, among other things, in 15 cities.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Lingling Wei   </div><div>1098 words</div><div>10 March 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The estate of real-estate baroness Leona Helmsley has signed a deal to sell one of its prime Manhattan hotels for about $170 million, in a sign that investor appetite is keen for trophy assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale of the Helmsley Carlton House to a venture of private-equity firm <span class="companylink">Angelo, Gordon &amp; Co</span>. and Extell Development Co. also marks the beginning of the final act of the Helmsley saga in which the properties accumulated over four decades by the late Harry Helmsley are going to be sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mrs. Helmsley, who inherited the empire, died in August 2007, her estate began moving to sell properties. But those plans were shelved when the credit crunch and recession unhinged the commercial real-estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While that sector is still suffering from the downturn, a growing volume of distressed property and trophy assets are attracting attention from investors who have accumulated large war chests in hopes of taking advantage of market woes. The buyer of the Carlton House, <span class="companylink">Angelo Gordon</span>, raised a total of $2 billion in 2006 and 2007 and had spent only 25% of that capital until mid-2009, when the firm began buying again, according to an investor in its funds. Located in the heart of the tony Madison Avenue shopping district, the retail space in Carlton House is among the most valuable in the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new owner plans to convert the upper floors into apartments. Condominiums and co-op apartments on Manhattan's Upper East Side still fetch high prices although they, too, have suffered from the housing collapse. The new owner also plans to double the retail space to take advantage of the prime location.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market is very ready for quality products," said Darcy Stacom, vice chairman at brokerage <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis Inc</span>. who represented the Helmsley estate in the deal. Ms. Stacom said in an interview Tuesday that the Carton House attracted interest from more than 200 investor groups, and about a dozen of them made the final round of bidding for the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People are extremely frustrated," she said, referring to investors who have raised money to do deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Stacom declined to identify others eyeing the property but people familiar with the matter say they included a Who's Who of New York real estate. Among them: New York developer Harry Macklowe, who teamed up with private-equity firm <span class="companylink">Fortress Investment Group LLC</span>; Barry Sternlicht's Starwood Capital; Arthur and William Zeckendorf; a venture of Stanley Chera and Jacob Safra; and developer Daniel Brodsky. Mr. Chera confirmed his interest in the property. The other investors declined to comment or couldn't be reached.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People familiar with the property say the price that the <span class="companylink">Angelo Gordon</span> group is paying is much less than a buyer would have paid at the market's peak in 2007, when it likely would have gone for over $200 million. Nevertheless, it is higher than what Mrs. Helmsley's estate hoped to get, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyers would need to rent the retail space for $650 a square foot and sell apartments for at least $2,000 a square foot for their investment to pay off. "The price is within reason for such an excellent asset," said Joseph Tuchman, director of acquisitions, at the Hakim Organization, one of the bidders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Helmsley's estate, which was valued at $5 billion, is expected to begin selling other properties that Mr. Helmsley acquired or developed. Its holdings include the <span class="companylink">Park Lane Hotel</span>, the New York Helmsley, a stake in the Empire State Building and the Sandcastle Hotel in Sarasota, Fla. The <span class="companylink">Park Lane Hotel</span>, which overlooks Manhattan's Central Park, was on the market in 2008, only to be pulled off as the financial crisis intensified.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Helmsley left the bulk of her fortune to the Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust. She also bequeathed $12 million to her dog, Trouble, and comparatively little to her closet relatives. A Manhattan judge in 2008 reduced Trouble's inheritance to $2 million. The Maltese poodle lives in the Sandcastle Hotel and her security alone costs the estate about $100,000 a year, according to published reports. "Trouble is no trouble. She's alive, well and thriving," said Howard Rubenstein, a spokesman for the estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The charitable trust, which listed $2.7 billion in total assets as of Mar. 31, 2009, has been giving out charitable gifts since early last year. In April 2009, it distributed $136 million in its first charitable grants, including $40 million to create a digestive diseases center at New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center, $35 million to start two research facilities at Mount Sinai Medical Center, and $1 million to 10 animal and dog charities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pressure continues to build in the commercial real-estate market, with landlords struggling with rising vacancies, falling rents and heavy debt loads. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said recently that commercial property loans at small and regional banks are "the biggest credit issue that we still have." Nearly $200 billion of commercial properties in the U.S. are now in default, foreclosure or bankruptcy, <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span> estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deal volume is increasing as signs increase that values have stabilized. According to Real Capital, the amount of investment sales increased to $18.8 billion in the fourth quarter from only $10.4 billion in the first quarter of 2009. Still, that figure remains a fraction of the $145 billion seen in the first quarter of 2007, the market peak. The firm estimates that about $20.9 billion of property was brought to the market this quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is a good time to execute a sales plan, as there are fewer items on the shelf for sale, and yet assets still trade at big discounts to replacement costs as well as can offer buyers a discount from the peak pricing in 2007," says Douglas Harmon, a senior managing director at Eastdil Secured.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Harmon, who had advised Ms. Helmsley in selling over $4 billion of properties between 1997 and 1999, said potential buyers shouldn't expect to acquire prime real estate at 50% to 60% discounts off of the 2007 levels. "The question now is how much product can the market absorb at rebounding values," he said. "I predict a great deal."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At long last, the market for luxury real estate is coming back to life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices for primary residences, which plunged at least 20% from the peak in 2007, appear to have bottomed. In some of the snappiest locations, scattered bidding wars are breaking out and prices are turning upward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Greenwich, Conn., realty brokers say, the final months of 2009 were almost record-setters for sales volume, as two years of pent-up demand was unleashed. Even the megadeal is back. In Beverly Hills, film producer Jeffrey Katzenberg just plunked down $35 million for an 8,700-square-foot home on six acres.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's nothing like a stabilized economy and a huge rebound in stocks to send folks looking for the perfect manse. The return of hefty Wall Street bonuses hasn't hurt, either.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With all that in mind, and with summer just around the corner, Barron's sized up the market for upscale second homes, one of the greatest luxuries of all. We scoped out dozens of deluxe enclaves across the country, speaking with brokers, homeowners and others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices are way down–40% off the peak in some locations. Seemingly at or near bottom, they are starting to attract the first wave of bargain hunters–and not just families in need of R&amp;R. Hard-nosed investors also are on the prowl, says Jan Reuter, head of residential real estate at U.S. Trust Bank of America Private Wealth Management: "We've seen an uptick in buying in just the last couple of months."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To help you in the hunt, Barron's has selected the 10 best places in America for second homes. These alluring locales have it all: gorgeous houses, spectacular views, world-class golf, fishing and skiing, fine dining and great shopping. You'll find the complete range of lifestyles, from peaceful and easy to vigorously social.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some warnings: 1) Our selections are every bit as subjective as tastes in homes themselves. 2) The prices cited are based mainly on conversations with locals, because hard data isn't available. 3) Your plush new retreat may take some time to rise in value. Serious appreciation will require a better economy and, quite possibly, another big rally in stocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But hey, you could do worse than marking time in paradise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. Maui Consistently rated the "Best Island in the World" by travel experts, this Hawaiian beauty underwent a growth spurt during the past decade that some critics bemoaned as excessive. But the southern coast, anchored by the hamlet of Wailea, has weathered it all well. One of the first master-planned resort communities in the nation, it's a balanced blend of understated gated communities, luxury resort hotels, three excellent golf courses, a tennis center and, of course, several crescent sandy beaches. Wailea has 500 single-family homes, and their views are stunning: lush, verdant hills, brilliantly blue ocean and, after the steamy sun showers, rainbows over the horizon.</p>

The island has one developer, Kiawah Development Partners, and an architectural review board that protects the 4,500 or so properties from the excesses often seen when wealth meets water. It has 10 miles of hard-sand beaches and abundant wildlife: bobcats, gray foxes, loggerhead turtles and more. Its Ocean Course has long been favorite of golfers; it hosted the 2007 Senior PGA Championship. Want to tee up some culture? Charleston is just 45 minutes away.</p>

The Hamptons Long the favored retreat of high-powered New Yorkers, the Hamptons are a just now experiencing a fresh jump in home sales, realty brokers say. Credit the revival in Wall Street bonuses. Southampton, bastion of old money, is known for its grand estates, but lovely homes can be found in what not long ago were potato fields. In chic East Hampton, the choicest real estate is on <span class="companylink">Georgica</span> Pond. Alas, most of the area's finest properties never come to market. Once you own a home in the Hamptons, you own it forever.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4. Park City, Utah Skiers love Park City for its powdery winters, but homeowners relish the summers, too. The crowds thin out, life slows down and the tall aspens lining the nearby Wasatch range shimmer in the breeze. The one-street Old West downtown is dotted with classic Victorian houses, while Deer Valley, an understated year-round resort community, sits on the eastern edge. Its namesake ski hill has been crowned by readers of Ski Magazine as North America's top ski resort for three years running. For $100,000, you can join the nearby Talisker Club, with links designed by PGA Tour Champion Mark O'Meara.

Aspen isn't just a year-round playground; it's also a cultural oasis, the home to the Aspen Institute think tank, a world-class symphony, and dance and art festivals. The four major ski hills speak for the themselves. The Maroon Creek Club includes a challenging golf course designed by Tom Fazio. The city's West End has a mix of 19th-century Victorians and modern abodes not far from the "beachfront"–downtown neighborhoods within walking distance of the lift. The posh shopping is so good that some folks never find their way up to the trails.</p>

There are several other public and private golf courses within the guarded gates of the verdant Del Monte Forest, which surrounds the community of Pebble Beach.

Oodles of socialites and tycoons wouldn't have it any other way. Neither would Jimmy Buffett, Rush Limbaugh and too many other boldface names to mention. In addition to the never-ending social whirl, residents like the shopping on Worth Avenue and the beauty of Addison Mizner's Mediterranean-style architecture.

Some homebuyers come from the Northeast, and many come from Florida to beat the heat. The locals call them "halfbacks," since Asheville is halfway up the East Coast. The town has a university and a thriving art scene. We like the 1920s-vintage Tudor homes in the Biltmore Forest district, once part of the adjacent Biltmore Estate.

Golf carts -- some customized to resemble '57 Chevys -- are the favored mode of transportation.

</div><div class="author">By Sara Murray   </div><div>527 words</div><div>5 March 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New claims for jobless benefits fell last week, but the number of workers filing first-time claims remains stubbornly high as many employers resist adding jobs in the face of a tepid economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, an index of pending home sales fell, adding to concerns about the recent stall in the housing market's revival. And in an indication that employers aren't rushing to add workers, nonfarm business productivity rose at a 6.9% annual rate during the fourth quarter, higher than the initial 6.2% estimate, as employers got more output from workers, the Labor Department said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The labor market is still very much lagging the rest of the economy," said Zach Pandl, a Nomura Global Economics analyst. "Firms are increasing their output but are not yet hiring."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial unemployment claims fell by 29,000 to a seasonally adjusted 469,000 in the week ended Feb. 27, the Labor Department said Thursday. Severe winter weather and holidays likely distorted jobs data in recent weeks, and economists predict these unusual factors will contribute to another drop in payrolls in the government's official unemployment tally due to be released on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four-week moving average of unemployment claims, which aims to smooth volatility in the data, declined 3,500 to 470,750. And continuing claims, which are drawn by workers for more than one week, dropped 134,000 to 4.5 million in the week ended Feb. 20.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the fourth-quarter productivity gains reflected a 7.6% quarterly jump in output which was brought down slightly by a 0.6% increase in hours worked. Inflation-adjusted hourly wages are hurting: They fell 2.8% from the prior quarter. Unit labor costs also dropped at a 5.9% annual rate in the fourth quarter as inflation remained modest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Over the long haul, productivity growth is the source of real wage gains and the friend of labor," RDQ Economics analysts wrote in a note to clients. "In the short run, however, strong productivity gains are raising the bar that economic growth needs to clear in order to create jobs."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to labor-market weakness, the drop in pending home sales prompted further economic worries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index of pending home sales fell 7.6% to 90.4 in January, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. The drop may have been influenced by weather, but economists are still concerned that the market is showing signs of fundamental weakness. Both existing and new-home sales plummeted in January. To be sure, it may be a temporary lull brought on by prior uncertainty about whether a government tax credit for buying homes would be extended. Now that it isn't set to expire until April 30, sales could pick up again in the spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, manufacturing strength continued in January as factory orders rose a seasonally adjusted 1.7% to $378.4 billion, the Commerce Department said Thursday. Orders for durable goods, designed to last at least three years, climbed 2.6%. Orders for nondurables rose 0.9%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After 19 months on the market, a house owned by Aerosmith drummer Joey Kramer on the South Shore of Massachusetts has sold for $2.7 million, 27% less than its most recent asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gated 17-acre compound is in Marshfield Hills, Mass., a coastal town about 20 miles south of Boston. Overlooking the Atlantic Ocean and the North River, the 6,200-square-foot shingled house has four bedrooms and a recording studio. There's a carriage house for guests, a pool, a Koi pond and three stand-alone garages where Mr. Kramer kept his car collection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 59-year-old musician, a founding member of the band, combined two properties and built the house in 2003. He and his wife, April, have divorced and put the property up for sale for $5 million in July 2008. Janet Koelsch of Coldwell Banker represented the Kramers. LandVest's Terry Boyle represented the buyers, commercial real-estate developer Jack Tweed and his wife Julie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mexican Estate Linked to Edra Blixseth Listed</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another bank-controlled property tied to Edra Blixseth, ex-wife of timber magnate Tim Blixseth, has gone on the market—this one in Los Cabos, Mexico, for $12.88 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Blixseth gained control of the home in divorce proceedings but has declared personal bankuptcy. The roughly two-acre oceanfront estate has a 10,000-square-foot house with six bedrooms and more than 7,000 square feet of outdoor living space. The floors, windows and decks are all made of teak. There's a pool and more than 280 feet of ocean frontage. Chris Snell of Snell Real Estate in Los Cabos, Mexico, has the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bank-controlled 249-acre estate in Rancho Mirage, Calif., built by the Blixseths was also recently listed for $75 million.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Woodland, Utah -- Deep in cattle country sits a gated community the size of Manhattan, where a small number of wealthy home owners can enjoy the feeling of living in the middle of nowhere -- except for the 24-hour security, parties and cellphone access.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's the concept behind Wolf Creek Ranch, a 5,665-hectare development with just 84 lots of 65 hectares apiece, making the lots roughly 10 times larger than most gated resort communities. An hour from Salt Lake City and about 20 minutes from the Deer Valley and Park City ski resorts, Wolf Creek positions itself as a "private national park" -- a compromise between traditional luxury developments with all the amenities and mega size stand-alone ranches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owners are a mix of wealthy Utah residents and business executives, including sports executive Dave Checketts and former Citigroup Chief Financial Officer Gary Crittenden. While they say they relish mingling with nature, owners also get access to a club barn for get-togethers, an equestrian center, four yurts set up for deluxe camping stints, cellphone access (the tower is disguised as a pine tree) and 43 kilometers of paved roads. They socialize around the quarterly association meetings -- the highlight being an annual autumn elk bugling party, in which everyone breaks into groups with bugles to call out to the male elks. (The elks are gazed at -- hunting isn't allowed.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I can go out on my snowmobile all day and not see anyone," said Tom Watson, head of the Memphis, Tennessee, moving company Armstrong Relocation, on a recent Friday afternoon here. Mr. Watson, who had just moved into his new 13,000-square-foot log home, stopped his black Suburban to admire two moose navigating a snow bank. "Where else can you see this and then drive away on a nicely paved road?" he asked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wolf Creek was the brainchild of Salt Lake City developer Douglas Anderson, who bought the sheep-farming land for $60 million from 16 owners. Out of the 84 lots, 81 have sold, and this past year more than two-dozen houses have been under construction, says Mr. Anderson. Three homes are currently for sale, ranging from $2.2 million to an $18 million, 13,000-square-foot home with eight bedrooms, 15 bathrooms, an indoor riding arena and a guest house, says Will Lange, main listing agent for the development at Prudential Utah Real Estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The land abuts the 890,000-hectare Unita National Forest and sits between two small ranching towns with populations of less than 1,300. Wolf Creek's guards shoo away hunters and cyclists, which generates some grumbling among locals. "To ban cyclists from roads where there isn't a lot of traffic is just wrong," says Tom Noaker, who lives nearby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Anderson says the development has opened its doors to community events and sponsors a number of local causes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The night before the February meeting, Mr. Watson, 61 years old, and his wife Robin, 52, held a cocktail party. The Watsons, who primarily live in Memphis, initially bought their land for $1.5 million as an investment. But they liked spending time on the property so much -- snowmobiling, hiking, snowshoeing -- that they decided to build here, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Guests wandered through the new six-bedroom, eight-bathroom house that took about four years and $7 million to build. With lots of floor-to-ceiling windows, the house is designed with a series of arches that mimic the triangles of the pine trees in the landscape. Park City builder Jake Vainio says all the logs, doors and windows were prefabricated in Finland. He describes the result as a "Scandinavian home with an American lifestyle," explaining that in Scandinavia most homes aren't bigger than 2,000 square feet, while at Wolf Creek Ranch they are four times that size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inside, everything is big: stone pillars and wood beams, nine-meter ceilings in the great room and a dining table that seats 12. The spa is comparable to one at a luxury hotel. Designer Anne-Marie Barton, who chose faded antique Oriental carpets, antique furniture and a nutmeg color scheme to give an aged feeling, calls the house "casual European."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are always house guests, often company employees with their spouses. "I help him shovel the snow or clean out the fireplace if he needs help," said Randy Vallejo, Armstrong's director of quality, who was there for the weekend with his wife. Mr. Vallejo went into the kitchen and started putting away groceries he'd bought to make the next day's breakfast for the Watsons and the other house guests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neighbor Norm Provan chatted with some of Mr. Watson's Memphis friends, joking that he could never invite Mr. Watson over because of all the house guests that are always around. Mr. Provan, one of the earlier home builders and the only full-time resident, sighed: "It's getting kind of crowded up here now."'</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sara Murray </div><div>451 words</div><div>5 March 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New claims for jobless benefits fell last week, but the number of workers filing first-time claims remains stubbornly high as many employers resist adding jobs in the face of a tepid economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, an index of pending home sales fell, adding to concerns about the recent stall in the housing market's revival. And in an indication that employers aren't rushing to add workers, nonfarm business productivity rose at a 6.9% annual rate during the fourth quarter, higher than the initial 6.2% estimate, as employers got more output from workers, the Labor Department said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The labor market is still very much lagging the rest of the economy," said Zach Pandl, a Nomura Global Economics analyst. "Firms are increasing their output but are not yet hiring."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial unemployment claims fell by 29,000 to a seasonally adjusted 469,000 in the week ended Feb. 27, the Labor Department said Thursday. Severe winter weather and holidays likely distorted jobs data in recent weeks, and economists predict these unusual factors will contribute to another drop in payrolls in the government's official unemployment tally due to be released on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four-week moving average of unemployment claims, which aims to smooth volatility in the data, declined 3,500 to 470,750. And continuing claims, which are drawn by workers for more than one week, dropped 134,000 to 4.5 million in the week ended Feb. 20.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the fourth-quarter productivity gains reflected a 7.6% quarterly jump in output which was brought down slightly by a 0.6% increase in hours worked. Inflation-adjusted hourly wages are hurting: They fell 2.8% from the prior quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Over the long haul, productivity growth is the source of real wage gains and the friend of labor," RDQ Economics analysts wrote in a note to clients. "In the short run, however, strong productivity gains are raising the bar that economic growth needs to clear in order to create jobs."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index of pending home sales fell 7.6% to 90.4 in January, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. The drop may have been influenced by weather, but economists are still concerned the market is showing signs of fundamental weakness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, manufacturing strength continued in January as factory orders rose a seasonally adjusted 1.7% to $378.4 billion, the Commerce Department said Thursday. Orders for durable goods, designed to last at least three years, climbed 2.6%. Orders for nondurables rose 0.9%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aerosmith's Kramer Sells</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Massachusetts Shore</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After 19 months on the market, a house owned by Aerosmith drummer Joey Kramer on the South Shore of Massachusetts has sold for $2.7 million, 27% less than its most recent asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gated 17-acre compound is in Marshfield Hills, Mass., a coastal town about 20 miles south of Boston. Overlooking the Atlantic Ocean and the North River, the 6,200-square-foot shingled house has four bedrooms and a recording studio. There's a carriage house for guests, a pool, a Koi pond and three stand-alone garages where Mr. Kramer kept his car collection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 59-year-old musician, a founding member of the band, combined two properties and built the house in 2003. He and his wife, April, have divorced and put the property up for sale for $5 million in July 2008. Janet Koelsch of Coldwell Banker represented the Kramers. LandVest's Terry Boyle represented the buyers, commercial real-estate developer Jack Tweed and his wife Julie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mexican Estate Linked</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To Edra Blixseth Listed</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another bank-controlled property tied to Edra Blixseth, ex-wife of timber magnate Tim Blixseth, has gone on the market -- this one in Los Cabos, Mexico, for $12.88 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Blixseth gained control of the home in divorce proceedings but has declared personal bankuptcy. The roughly two-acre oceanfront estate has a 10,000-square-foot house with six bedrooms and more than 7,000 square feet of outdoor living space. The floors, windows and decks are all made of teak. There's a pool and more than 280 feet of ocean frontage. Chris Snell of Snell Real Estate in Los Cabos, Mexico, has the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bank-controlled 249-acre estate in Rancho Mirage, Calif., built by the Blixseths was also recently listed for $75 million. Any offer for either property is subject to bankruptcy-court approval in Montana. Ms. Blixseth is best known as a founder of the billionaires' resort the Yellowstone Club in Montana. Last year, she sold the club to Boston-based private-equity firm CrossHarbor Capital Partners LLC.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Conor Dougherty </div><div>1052 words</div><div>4 March 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>33</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alex Castaneda hasn't had much luck selling his oil-on-canvas paintings of police officers or old men playing guitars. But when he painted corpulent female nudes on the bottom of skateboards, they sold out at a local gallery near his home in Lima, Peru. And he received multiple orders from the U.S. and Canada through the Internet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I was pretty shocked," says Mr. Castaneda, a 24-year-old recent art-school graduate who is not a skateboarder. "They just went like that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lowly skateboard, toy and transport of adolescents and the adolescent-minded, has found a second calling as a platform for art.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This April, a San Francisco art gallery will host a show called "Skate This Art," featuring works from some 100 local artists hand-painted on skateboards. This past holiday season, an Art + Design Collective retail store in Los Angeles was selling $1,000 skateboards featuring images of stylized puppies painted by Japanese artist Takashi Murakami.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mass retailers have caught on, too: Among the striped comforters and pink lounge chairs sold in the PBTeen catalog are wall-mounted skateboards and skateboard-shaped shelving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Skateboards are one of those unique things where it's a canvas, it's a lifestyle, and there is a culture around it," says Mark Schmid, a former professional skateboarder who has founded several skateboard-related companies. "Artists, musicians, they all want a piece of that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Skateboards aren't the only pop-culture item that has morphed into artwork. Guitars, shoes and snowboards are all sold with hand-painted illustrations and used to decorate walls in homes. Mr. Schmid has one company that specializes in selling the mountings needed to hang skateboards on walls, as well as other gear used to display sunglasses, records, and soon, baseball caps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ruben Ortiz Torres, an art professor at the University of California, San Diego, says skateboards and skate culture figure prominently in many of his student's works. But, he adds, "Decorating boards doesn't seem justifiable as art."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Skateboarders have mixed feelings about the phenomenon. Many love decorated boards, but avid skateboarders such as Jason Baldwin are resistant to buying them from artists who aren't also skateboarders. Mr. Baldwin, an art professor at Norwich University in Northfield, Vt., says: "The skater part of me is like: 'You have no business doing that -- you don't ride a board.' "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Baldwin has done his own skateboard painting, including a series of boards depicting broken bones. He got that idea after he broke his arm while pursuing his hobby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As long as there have been skateboards, there have been pictures on them. The early boards in the 1960s tended to have child-friendly graphics such as images of surfers or baseball stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Artistic styles shifted with the evolution of the skateboarding subculture, moving into images depicting everything from skulls and cartoon cigarettes to children finding their parents having intimate relations. Like skateboarders, the artwork they favor often exudes youthful protest and subversive themes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overall market for skateboards is estimated at $1.3 billion, though only a small slice of that is artwork, according to Board-Trac, a Trabuco Canyon, Calif.-based market-research company. Some companies cater to collectors with limited-edition skateboards that feature reproductions of works by famous artists, including Shepard Fairey and Andy Warhol.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For artists, the appeal is partly financial. Blank wooden "decks" -- the term for the maple boards, sans wheels -- are cheap, about $20 new. And many artists pick up bags of used decks for free at skateboard shops that would otherwise throw them out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Artists also like that painted boards have a built-in audience in the skateboarding community, which includes young people as well as ranks of enthusiasts who keep riding skateboards and watching skateboard competitions well into adulthood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In Hollywood, if they make a Spider-Man movie, they have a built-in audience" of comic-book fans, says Angela Jones, a Los Angeles artist who has a sideline painting skateboards. The same goes for skateboards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Pukac, an Alabama-born artist who lives in Long Beach, Calif., started painting decks a few years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March he is doing a show in Los Angeles that will feature only skateboards. The cluttered one-bedroom apartment he shares with his girlfriend is filled with paintings and other projects, including a deck covered with 3-D robots made of clay, a gun fashioned from old paint brushes, and a foam blowfish that has lips that pucker when a bike brake is pulled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pukac is now branching into other subcultures. Standing on the paint-encrusted easel in his work space is a canvas painting he thinks will be a hit with DJs. It's a twist on Botticelli's famous painting, "The Birth of Venus," which hangs in Florence's Uffizi gallery and shows the goddess Venus rising from the sea on a shell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pukac's version features a voluptuous woman in headphones, standing over turntables that float on water. Below her, an octopus passes records with one tentacle and uses another to drop the needle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I like finding a culture and getting into it," says Mr. Pukac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not far away, in a loft near downtown Los Angeles, Ms. Jones, the artist, has paintings of clouds and horses on wall-mounted canvases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But lately, she's been doing more and more skateboards with images of skulls, candles and dead fruit on them. Ms. Jones got the idea to paint decks, she says, while living in nearby Venice Beach, where hordes of people ride skateboards on the town's famous boardwalk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I really wanted to paint something old on something new," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all buyers are skateboarders. Dan Jefferson Gutierrez is a 22-year-old Los Angeles college student and clerical worker at a health-insurance company and isn't an active skateboarder. He bought one of Mr. Castaneda's boards featuring naked women, and says he wouldn't have wanted the same thing on canvas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's more fascinating on a skate deck," says Mr. Gutierrez. "It's not hanging in some exhibit somewhere. It's on a skate deck."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The former Knickerbocker Hotel site near the heart of Times Square has become the latest <span class="companylink">Dubai World</span> investment to go belly up, as well as the target of investors wanting to pick up the property at a discount price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Istithmar World Capital, the private-equity arm of the Dubai government's investment fund, recently handed back the keys to the 700-square-meter building at 42nd and Broadway to its lender, <span class="companylink">Danske Bank A/S</span>, after defaulting on its $300 million mortgage. The property, which served guests like Italian tenor Enrico Caruso during its heyday, was part of the Dubai firm's ill-fated strategy of running "upmarket hotels in gateway cities," said a person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent decades, the property has been operated as an office building known as 1466 Broadway. But Istithmar emptied it of most of tenants as part of a plan to convert it back into a hotel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While there are plenty of struggling properties on the market, the building is attracting interest because it represents one of the best development sites in the Times Square area for a new hotel. Its appeal is enhanced because, besides paying $300 million for the building, Istithmar also spent $76 million to buy an adjoining vacant lot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank has hired <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> to market the property and is getting a lot of interest, said Ben Singer a <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> broker. Among the interested bidders is <span class="companylink">Sitt Asset Management</span>, the New York real-estate company that sold Istithmar the building in 2006, according to people familiar with the matter. Sitt executives didn't return calls seeking comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York City hotels have been clobbered along with the rest of the lodging industry. "About half the hotels in New York City are experiencing some level of financial distress," said Bjorn Hanson, a hospitality professor at New York University's Tisch Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But New York hotels also have been able to maintain a relatively high level of occupancy because of discounting. Rates in the city also remain the highest in the country. Investors who are bullish on the New York hotel business recognize that the Knickerbocker represents a rare buying opportunity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That entire area still is a highly desirable area for hotel development, especially if there can be views of all the neon lights and Times Square activity," Mr. Hanson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Istithmar purchased the beaux-arts-style office building in 2006 near the height of the commercial real-estate boom. The Dubai firm had hoped to convert the office building back to a five-star hotel, with up to 300 rooms. The private-equity firm last fall abandoned those plans when it became squeezed for cash. At that point, a Times Square building no longer fit the firm's strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In planning to return the Knickerbocker to its former glory, Istithmar had much history to draw on. Financed by the Astor family and known as the 42nd Street Country Club, the hotel was one of the most prestigious spots in midtown Manhattan when it opened at the start of the 20th century. It was the initial home to the famous Maxfield Parrish 9-meter-long mural of Old King Cole, now residing at Manhattan's St. Regis hotel. But Prohibition hurt the Knickerbocker's business, and it closed in 1921, becoming a residential, and later office, building. Partly because Istithmar hasn't been renewing leases, the building, which has a Gap store at the base, is nearly 50% vacant, according to real-estate research firm CoStar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dubai went on a high-end hotel buying spree around the height of the market, scooping up a 50% stake in the Fontainebleau Miami Beach for about $375 million in 2008. It bought a 73% stake in Manhattan's Mandarin Oriental in 2007, when the hotel was valued at about $340 million. Istithmar also acquired the Washington Hotel near the White House, which the firm converted to a W Hotel that reopened last fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The highest and best use," for this property is a hotel," says Dan Fasulo, managing director for real-estate research firm <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While <span class="companylink">Danske Bank</span> is technically marketing the first mortgage, the winning bidder also will get the deed, whi0.0.ch is being held in escrow, said Mr. Singer. He declined to comment on the identity of interested bidders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fasulo said the first mortgage note is being shopped at $290 million, and the property may be worth less because of the substantial capital any buyer would have to invest for renovations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm's turnover of the Times Square building marks the latest setback for Istithmar. In December, it lost the W Hotel Union Square in New York City in a foreclosure auction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The following month, its chief executive officer, David Jackson, resigned.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In St. Petersburg, Fla., close by Tropicana Field, an unusual structure is emerging from a construction site: a rental apartment building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The work in progress on the Fusion 1560, a 325-unit upscale project in one of the states hit hardest by the housing crisis, is a sign that developers of multifamily housing are tiptoeing back into the business. This year, real-estate investment trusts, or REITs, are expected to start close to $1 billion in new multifamily projects, according to real-estate research firm Green Street Advisors. While that still is less than average, it is a significant increase over the $100 million of development starts in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts caution that the increase in construction doesn't mean there has been an improvement in the business. Apartment vacancy is at a record and unemployment, essential to the sector's health, remains elevated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But operators are betting that limited new supply, combined with an improving economy, will lead to ideal market conditions nationwide starting in 2011 or 2012. From then until 2015, "apartment REITs may generate the best property net operating income growth that they've seen in a very long time, maybe ever," said Haendel St. Juste, a REIT analyst with Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, there are risks. Given the multiyear construction window, companies have to start now to be ready in time. If the economy weakens further and recovery is delayed, landlords may be forced to keep rents low or offer free rent to get leases signed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's an element of risk," said Andrew McCulloch, an analyst with Green Street. "But if you were to go back a year, the outlook is much more clear today. Their confidence level in that eventual recovery is much higher."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owners said the rent declines appear to have bottomed out in some areas and concessions are moderating. In New York, <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> said it has stopped paying broker fees for certain unit types. In better times tenants pay that fee, typically one month's rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gap between new and renewal leases has narrowed from about 10% nine months ago to about 5% today, a sign of confidence as landlords have to give up less to sign new tenants, Mr. St. Juste said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Landlords also are excited about demand. The 20-to-34 age group, prime renting age, is expected to increase by five million in the next decade, according to Hessam Nadji, managing director of Marcus &amp; Millichap, a real-state-investment brokerage firm. People who moved home or who bunked with roommates during the downturn also might ink leases as the economy improves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, construction costs "have fallen rapidly in the last two years," said Tom Toomey, chief executive of apartment owner UDR[http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?symbol=UDR&amp;type=usstock%20usfund&amp;mod=DNH_S] Inc. A unit that would have cost $300,000 to build two years ago could now be built for as little as $220,000, Mr. Toomey said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lumber prices have been cut 15%, while concrete prices are down 10%, he said. Labor costs have fallen as much as 15%. Starting development now "is starting to become an easier decision," Mr. Toomey said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sector's optimism was apparent in January's housing starts. Construction of multifamily dwellings rose 9.2%, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Humphreys &amp; Partners Architects LP in Dallas, which designs apartments, inquires and job counts have more than doubled from a year earlier, said Chief Executive Mark Humphreys. "This time last year the financial world had come to an end," Mr. Humphreys said. "Everybody was frozen in time; they were just stunned. The phone was not ringing. Well, the phone is ringing now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers said they are avoiding Las Vegas and Phoenix, which were overbuilt during the housing frenzy, in favor of more stable markets, including Washington, Boston and San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2011, <span class="companylink">AvalonBay Communities Inc</span>. plans to complete six projects with more than 2,100 units in locations including Walnut Creek, Calif., New York and West Long Branch, N.J. The rents will average more than $2,000 a month, according to securities filings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span>, meanwhile, plans to deliver 111 units in New York's Chelsea neighborhood in late 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers also are using conservative projections when planning projects. Zaremba Group, which is building Fusion 1560, is targeting rents between $925 and $2,300 a month in 2011, when it hopes to be fully leased. Mr. Zaremba said that matches the current market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're not banking on [rent increases]," he said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By A.D. Pruitt                And Craig Karmin   </div><div>905 words</div><div>3 March 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The former Knickerbocker Hotel site near the heart of Times Square has become the latest <span class="companylink">Dubai World</span> investment to go belly up, as well as the target of investors wanting to pick up the property at a discount price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Istithmar World Capital, the private-equity arm of the Dubai government's investment fund, recently handed back the keys to the 300,000-square-foot building at 42nd and Broadway to its lender, <span class="companylink">Danske Bank A/S</span>, after defaulting on its $300 million mortgage. The property, which served guests like Italian tenor Enrico Caruso during its heyday, was part of the Dubai firm's ill-fated strategy of running "upmarket hotels in gateway cities," said a person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent decades, the property has been operated as an office building known as 1466 Broadway. But Istithmar emptied it of most of tenants as part of a plan to convert it back into a hotel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While there are plenty of struggling properties on the market, the building is attracting interest because it represents one of the best development sites in the Times Square area for a new hotel. Its appeal is enhanced because, besides paying $300 million for the building, Istithmar also spent $76 million to buy an adjoining vacant lot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank has hired <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> to market the property and is getting a lot of interest, said Ben Singer a <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> broker. Among the interested bidders is <span class="companylink">Sitt Asset Management</span>, the New York real-estate company that sold Istithmar the building in 2006, according to people familiar with the matter. Sitt executives didn't return calls seeking comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York City hotels have been clobbered along with the rest of the lodging industry. "About half the hotels in New York City are experiencing some level of financial distress," said Bjorn Hanson, a hospitality professor at New York University's Tisch Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But New York hotels also have been able to maintain a relatively high level of occupancy because of discounting. Its rates also remain the highest in the country. Investors who are bullish on the New York hotel business recognize that the Knickerbocker represents a rare buying opportunity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That entire area still is a highly desirable area for hotel development, especially if there can be views of all the neon lights and Times Square activity," Mr. Hanson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Istithmar purchased the beaux-arts-style office building in 2006 near the height of the commercial real-estate boom. The Dubai firm had hoped to convert the office building back to a five-star hotel, with up to 300 rooms. The private-equity firm last fall abandoned those plans when it became squeezed for cash. At that point, a Times Square building no longer fit the firm's strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In planning to return the Knickerbocker to its former glory, Istithmar had much history to draw on. Financed by the Astor family and known as the 42nd Street Country Club, the hotel was one of the most prestigious spots in midtown Manhattan when it opened at the start of the 20th century. It was the initial home to the famous Maxfield Parrish 30-foot-long mural of Old King Cole, now residing at Manhattan's St. Regis hotel. But Prohibition hurt the Knickerbocker's business, and it closed in 1921, becoming a residential, and later office, building.Partly because Istithmar hasn't been renewing leases, the building, which has a Gap store at the base, is nearly 50% vacant, according to real-estate research firm CoStar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dubai went on a high-end hotel buying spree around the height of the market, scooping up a 50% stake in the Fontainebleau Miami Beach for about $375 million in 2008. It bought a 73% stake in Manhattan's Mandarin Oriental in 2007, when the hotel was valued at about $340 million. Istithmar also acquired the Washington Hotel near the White House, which the firm converted to a W Hotel that reopened last fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The highest and best use," for this property is a hotel," says Dan Fasulo, managing director for real-estate research firm <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While <span class="companylink">Danske Bank</span> is technically marketing the first mortgage, the winning bidder also will get the deed, which is being held in escrow, said Mr. Singer. He declined to comment on the identity of interested bidders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fasulo said the first mortgage note is being shopped at $290 million, and the property may be worth less because of the substantial capital any buyer would have to invest for renovations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm's turnover of the Times Square building marks the latest setback for Istithmar. In December, it lost the W Hotel Union Square in New York City in a foreclosure auction. The following month, its chief executive officer, David Jackson, resigned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Dubai World</span> has nearly $60 billion in liabilities and is in the process of trying to restructure about $22 billion in debt. Istithmar, which is segregated from the <span class="companylink">Dubai World</span> debt-restructuring process, has invested about $15 billion in a variety of investments, using less than $5 billion in cash, with the rest in borrowed money, according to estimates from research firm Roubini Global Economics.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jim Carlton </div><div>891 words</div><div>1 March 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LAS VEGAS -- Home builders in some of the nation's hardest-hit housing markets are going to work directly for banks, in a little-used arrangement that is helping to ameliorate conditions in some battered local economies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The builders traditionally got loans from banks to build homes, but that credit has largely dried up. The contract work builders are getting is welcome as many of them struggle to stay afloat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Randy Schaefer, who has been building homes in this city since 1981, recently began working for a bank for the first time. In September, construction lender Housing Capital Co. hired him to help finish a subdivision of 170 homes in the desert outskirts here. While Mr. Schaefer is only being paid a flat fee instead of any profit on the three to four homes a month he has agreed to build, it enables him to keep his eight workers employed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It helps stop the bleeding," said Mr. Schaefer, 58 years old, who slashed his work force from 17 after the housing market tanked in Las Vegas starting in 2007. "It's not my first choice, but it helps keep me in business."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Mr. Schaefer, builders from California to Florida are starting to contract their services to lenders, many of whom have been left holding unfinished homes after the original builder went belly up. While there are no data on the trend, many builders are taking this work for the first time, particularly in markets like Nevada, Arizona and California, says Stephen Melman, director of economic services for the National Association of Home Builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend helps preserve relationships between builders and lenders in a strained time for the two. In some of these situations, home builders are working for the same institutions that won't lend money to them. While banks have hired builders before for fees, the trend is more prevalent now as more financial institutions own foreclosed properties, experts said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pattern wasn't as widespread in past downturns, when builders more commonly responded by taking cost-cutting steps such as reducing the number of homes they built and trimming their staffs, industry officials said. "There was always some credit [for] them before, but now there's practically none," said Irene Porter, executive director of the Southern Nevada Home Builders' Association. "That's the big difference."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shift also helps the banks. In Atlanta, <span class="companylink">Beazer Homes USA Inc</span>. in November was selected by Hearthstone Inc., an institutional investor in Los Angeles, to build and market homes on 462 lots over the next two to three years after another builder on the job went out of business. Hearthstone President Mark Porath said the company initially faced selling the lots for a loss after the first builder went bust. Now with Beazer on board, Hearthstone stands to eke out a small profit, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beazer officials said the deal -- its biggest ever with a bank -- allows it to expand in a market they feel has growth potential without facing much downside risk. Beazer is being paid "more a fixed than variable" payment for its work, with some "upside" compensation if certain goals are met, said Beazer Chief Financial Officer Allan Merrill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend also enables more construction workers to stay on the job. In Las Vegas, the December unemployment rate was 13.1%, according to state estimates, compared with 10% nationwide. Although Las Vegas's numbers aren't broken down by occupation, industry officials say construction workers account for many of the jobless.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, the number of single-family homes constructed and sold in Las Vegas plunged 85% to 5,271 in 2009 from 36,051 in 2006 as prices fell as much as 50% over the same time, according to the Southern Nevada Home Builders Association. Membership in the group has dropped by half to about 325 from 750 in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks own thousands of unfinished homes across Las Vegas. Housing Capital, for instance, foreclosed on 1,000 lots in the area, including 250 in a partially built development in Henderson, Nev., said Ross Wakeham, a manager of the Costa Mesa, Calif., construction lender.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the lender faced steep losses if it sold the lots as they were, he said, such as getting as little as $75,000 on a partially completed two-bedroom condominium for which it had lent $165,000. Last year it hired builder Signature Homes to finish some of the homes, paying roughly $12,000 per condo. Housing Capital was then able to sell some of the condos for $120,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We'll never get our losses back, but you are trying to residual a little bit more on your land," said Mr. Wakeham, whose firm hired also Mr. Schaefer's company for another subdivision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Housing Capital's work has helped Signature Homes keep building roughly 50 homes a year, though that is still down from the 800 it was building in 2006, said Richard Plaster, president of the Las Vegas firm. The builder, which hasn't previously worked for a bank, has also expanded into developing rental units to keep busy, he said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sara Murray </div><div>617 words</div><div>27 February 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market faltered last month as sales of previously occupied homes tumbled, according to a report released Friday. A separate report showed the overall economy grew faster in the fourth quarter than the government originally projected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy grew at a 5.9% seasonally adjusted annual rate in the fourth quarter, up from the previous estimate of 5.7%, according to a revised estimate of gross domestic product released by the Commerce Department Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the improvement came from businesses drawing down inventories at a slower rate, a dynamic that adds to growth because of the way GDP is calculated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer spending, meanwhile, was revised lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The strength in manufacturing is only a temporary factor and it's not likely to remain the driver of the economy," said Anna Piretti, a <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span> economist, "and I think that's the one worrying factor."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another concern is the recent weakness in the housing market. Existing-home sales fell 7.2% in January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.05 million units, the National Association of Realtors said Friday. Sales of single-family homes also fell 6.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.43 million last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taken in combination with the even larger drop in new-home sales reported earlier this week, the data suggest that the housing market has hit a lull after a rush of sales late last year fueled by people scrambling to take advantage of a special tax credit. Severe winter weather is also blamed with dragging down the numbers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax credit had been set to expire in November, but was extended to cover sales through April 30 that close before July 1. Many economists expect sales to pick up again in coming months as buyers rush to beat the new deadline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stock of existing unsold homes sitting on the market rose in response to last month's sales drop. The number of available homes represented a 7.8 month supply in January, up from 7.2 months in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The updated GDP report shows housing contributed to growth last quarter, but at a lower rate than originally estimated. Residential fixed investment, the measurement of housing's contribution to growth, increased at a 5% annual rate in the fourth quarter, rather than the previously estimated 5.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Added strength in manufacturing helped offset that. The slowdown in inventory liquidation added 3.88 percentage points to growth last quarter, up from the previously estimated 3.39 points. Trade, which also tends to boost manufacturing, added 0.3 percentage points to GDP, down from the 0.5 points in the earlier estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturing is a relatively small part of the economy. For the recovery to really take off and be sustained, growth in other segments -- particularly consumer spending -- needs to accelerate. The revised report was disappointing on that score, showing that consumer spending rose at a 1.7% rate last quarter, compared with 2% initially reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All types of underlying demand remain weak. Final sales of domestic products, which strip out changes in inventories, rose 1.9% last quarter, down from the 2.2% originally estimated. But there are also positive signs. Businesses spent more than previously reported, for instance, and inflation remains in check.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans still face headwinds from tight credit and high unemployment. Reflecting those factors, the University of Michigan/Reuters consumer-sentiment index released Friday was down to 73.6 in February from 74.4 the prior month. Consumers felt slightly better about current conditions but worse about the economy's potential.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new single-family homes plunged last month, underscoring the fragility in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales dropped 11% in January from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 309,000, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. The decline brought sales to their lowest level since the government began tracking the numbers in 1963. Sales were 6.1% lower than in January 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This gauge of new-home sales is particularly volatile because it is based on a very small sample size and carries a wide margin of error. Still, the decline is an indication that the housing market remains feeble, despite improvements in the past year fueled by low mortgage rates, reduced home prices and a government tax credit for buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax credit, which was expanded and extended, is set to expire April 30. It could lead to an upturn in sales in the next few months as buyers rush to capitalize on it, analysts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home builders have sounded more optimistic in recent months, and several have reported narrower losses for the latest quarter. "I would say the market is in transition," said Richard Dugas, chief executive of <span class="companylink">Pulte Homes Inc</span>., the nation's largest builder, at a conference this week. "In 2009, we did see some areas of improvement, particularly as it relates to '08, and there are clearly going to be opportunities in 2010, along with continued risk."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales drop in January triggered a boost in the backlog of unsold new homes on the market, pushing it to the equivalent of what would normally be sold in 9.1 months versus eight months in December. And the abundance of homes on the market continued to bring prices down. The median sales price for new homes fell 2.4% to $203,500 in January from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Faltering demand also led to a drop in mortgage applications for new and existing homes. The Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted purchase index fell 7.3% for the week ended Feb. 19 from the prior week, the advocacy group said Wednesday. It is the index's lowest level since 1997</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a sign that some Bay Area residents still aren't comfortable shelling out the big bucks, sales of homes priced at $1 million or more fell by 27% in the region last year, outpacing the 24% decline in such sales statewide, according to MDA <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>. The Bay Area saw 7,261 sales of million-dollar-plus homes in 2009, down from 10,006 in 2008 and 18,926 in 2005. Santa Clara County saw the most, with 2,378 sales of such homes, while Solano County had the fewest, with 20. Reluctant buyers and a tight mortgage market contributed to the decline, <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> said. Meanwhile, Bay Area home sales at all price levels rose 16% last year from 2008, while sales statewide climbed 17%. One in 25 California home sales crossed the $1 million mark in 2009, compared with one in nine in 2006, according to <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European stocks ended a choppy session in the black Wednesday, as investors took heart from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's reassurance that interest rates will remain low for an extended period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the euro gained against the dollar, oil rose and gold prices fell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his testimony to the House Financial Services panel, Mr. Bernanke said last week's decision to raise the discount rate was part of the process of normalizing the economy and stated that the U.S. still requires record-low interest rates for several months at least, as the recovery from recession is expected to be slow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier in the session, worse-than-expected U.S. new home sales data dented stocks and confirmed Mr. Bernanke's conservative view on the economy. Figures showed U.S. new home sales unexpectedly plunged in January, with demand for single family homes down 11.2% from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted rate of 309,000—the lowest on record. Economists had been expecting sales to rise by 3.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, concerns about Greece were brought to the fore again after <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Rating Services warned it may downgrade the country by one or two notches in the next month. This would put Greece's long-term rating on the brink of junk territory. The Greek ASE Composite Index, down roughly 21% over three months, rose 0.2% to 1926.81 on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While most banking stocks put in a solid performance—Lloyds rose 3.4%, <span class="companylink">HSBC</span> added 2.5% and <span class="companylink">Societe Generale</span> gained 1.7%—Banco Santander and <span class="companylink">Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria</span> were badly hit after <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span> downgraded both stocks to "underweight."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The brokerage said premium ratings were increasingly hard to justify, adding that signs of stress in domestic property exposures and fears over Spain's fiscal situation "will see current premiums significantly eroded." This came after <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> downgraded ratings on Spanish hybrid securities Tuesday. BBVA fell 1.8%, while Santander lost 1.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday, euro-zone confidence indicators are at 1000 GMT, while in the U.S., durable goods data and initial jobless claims at 1330 GMT will be in focus. Also, Mr. Bernanke will remain in the spotlight as he addresses the Banking Panel in the last day of his Congressional testimony to the U.S. Senate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pan-European Stoxx 600 index closed up 0.2% to 247.22. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index rose 0.5% to 5342.92, France's CAC-40 Index gained 0.2% to 3715.68 and Germany's DAX added 0.2% to 5615.51.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In currency markets, the euro rose modestly against the dollar after Mr. Bernanke pointed to continued low interest rates. At the time of the European stock markets close, the euro was at $1.3583, from $1.3496 late Tuesday in New York, and sterling last traded at $1.5430 from $1.5440. The dollar was at 89.96 yen from 90.18 yen and at 1.0770 Swiss francs from 1.0830 francs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among commodities, crude-oil prices reversed earlier losses to trade higher after a government report showed an improvement in fuel demand. Late in Europe, light, sweet crude for April delivery was up 92 cents at $79.78 on the New York Mercantile exchange. Comex gold for April delivery was down 0.5% at $1097.40 per troy ounce late in Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In major market action: In Turkey, the ISE National-100 index declined 3.4% to 49,659.56 amid simmering tensions between the government and the military. More than 40 current and former military officers were arrested on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Basilea Pharmaceutica</span> shares jumped 9.1% after the Basel drug maker said it had partnered with Japan's <span class="companylink">Astellas Pharma</span> to market the Swiss company's isavuconazole antifungal, which is in Phase III clinical development to treat life-threatening invasive fungal infections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Fresenius Medical Care</span>, up 4.3%, lifted its 2009 dividend by 5%. The dialysis-care firm posted a 9% rise in net profit to $891 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rhodia shares rose 4.6% after the French specialty-chemicals group said that it expects profit to improve in 2010. The firm made the comments after reporting that it swung to a fourth-quarter profit and said it will reinstate its dividend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of Dutch chemicals group DSM fell 5.4% after it swung to a fourth-quarter net loss of €60 million, hit by impairment charges. A year earlier, the firm posted a profit of €42 million. Revenue declined 1% to €2 billion.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sara Murray                And Nick Timiraos   </div><div>610 words</div><div>24 February 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices kept falling, but at a slower rate, at the end of last year as the housing market continued to stabilize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home-price index declined 2.5% in the fourth quarter, compared with the same period a year earlier, according to a report released Tuesday. The slight drop is a clear improvement from earlier in the recession. In the fourth quarter of 2008, for example, home prices fell 18.2% from the same period in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Overall, this report suggests that the recent positive momentum in the U.S. housing market is gaining further traction and underscores that home prices are continuing to stabilize," Millan Mulraine, a <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span> analyst, wrote in a note to clients. "As such, we may only be a few months away before we see a monthly gain in national home prices."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The month-to-month change in home prices for a composite index of 20 housing markets that S&amp;P/Case-Shiller tracks showed that home prices rose 0.3% in December from the prior month, adjusted for normal seasonal variation. That measure of home prices also rose 0.3% in November.Prices fell in just five of the 20 markets included in the survey, remained flat in one and rose in the other 14.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not adjusted for seasonal variations, prices fell 0.2% in December from November. Home sales tend to slow during the winter, which in turn can lead to a drop in prices and may explain the decline in home prices on an unadjusted basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Shiller, the Yale University economist who co-founded the index that bears his name, called the home-price rebound during the second half of last year "the most dramatic turnaround" since he began charting home prices in 1987.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices fell by 11% for six months ending in April 2009, before rising by around 5% over the following six months. The last time home prices swung so sharply was in April 1991, when a 5% decline over six months was followed by a 2% rally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The volatility in prices and the massive amount of federal stimulus have clouded the current outlook for home prices. "The market has shown a lot of momentum," Mr. Shiller said. "What trend are we seeing now? It's very ambiguous."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shiller said that one of his greatest worries about the housing market are so-called strategic defaults, where borrowers who owe more than their homes are worth and can afford their monthly payments choose to default anyway. "What worries me right now is the default rate on mortgages," he said. "It might go up because of a change in our sense of responsibility to pay mortgages. People are angry and upset."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homeowners who are underwater on their mortgages is growing. Some 11.3 million households with a mortgage owed more than their homes were worth at the end of the fourth quarter, according to First American <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>, a real-estate information company based in Santa Ana, Calif., up from 10.7 million at the end of the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those problem mortgages are concentrated in the states that have had the biggest home price declines. In Nevada, seven in 10 borrowers were underwater at the end of December, up from 65% three months earlier. Nearly half of all borrowers in Arizona and Florida and one third of borrowers in California owe more than their properties are worth.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LAS VEGAS -- Jonathan Griffin, Michael Pawlak and Chris Iuso all are chasing bargains on foreclosed homes here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It should be easy. Las Vegas is one of the foreclosure capitals of the U.S., with about one in four households behind on house payments or in mortgage foreclosure. Yet all three of these shoppers -- a professional real-estate investor, a county official with federal funds designated for stabilizing neighborhoods and an installer of security systems who needs a new place to live -- are frustrated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I thought it would be a heck of a lot easier," said Mr. Iuso, a renter who wants to buy a home but has been outbid eight times, usually by investors able to pay cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bargain hunters here and in many other metropolitan areas are up against a paradox. By far the biggest wave of foreclosures since the Great Depression was expected to be a bonanza for anyone with cash or the ability to get a loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But prospective home buyers say it is increasingly difficult to find foreclosed homes at attractive prices in desirable neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supply is shrinking largely because of federal and state efforts to help millions of distressed homeowners avert foreclosure, which have delayed many likely foreclosures, keeping the homes off the market for now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bargain chase is even tougher for those buying with a loan. Investors with cash have an advantage in that their offers aren't conditional on obtaining a loan so banks often prefer selling to them than taking the risk that another offer will fall through. They are also often quick to react when bargains appear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So while it is still relatively easy to find a home for a few thousand dollars in Detroit, few want to move there. In the more-desirable Orange County, Calif., bidding wars are the norm on foreclosed homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the percentage of borrowers behind on payments continues to grow, the number of homes lost to foreclosure in California -- and thus available for resale -- fell 19% in 2009 from a year earlier to 190,360, according to MDA <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>, a real-estate data provider. The number of foreclosed homes owned by banks or mortgage investors and available for sale nationwide dwindled to 617,000 in December from a peak of 845,000 in November 2008, estimates <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To those frustrated by the drop in supply, John Burns, a prominent real-estate consultant based in Irvine, Calif., counsels: "Just be patient. They're coming." His firm, John Burns Real Estate Consulting, estimates that five million households, currently behind on mortgage payments, will end up losing their homes, dumping supply on the market over the next few years. In Las Vegas, this "shadow" inventory of pending supply is enough to last 18 months, the firm estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is also lots of demand, especially from investors, for those homes. As a result, Mr. Burns says home prices are likely to level out rather than plunge further, assuming that mortgage rates don't rise sharply and the economy continues recovering. But if mortgage rates do surge and the economy goes into another swoon, he says, there is a "massive risk" of a sharp drop in home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Iuso, the installer of security systems, isn't waiting. He is looking for a home priced at $120,000 to $150,000. "There really isn't much inventory to chase," Mr. Iuso said. His agent, Bryan Mitchell of <span class="companylink">Re/Max Associates</span>, says some bank-owned homes have attracted more than 20 offers within days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors have complaints, too. "This market has been kind of saturated" by people looking for deals, says Mr. Griffin, the investor, who bought camouflaged duck-hunting blinds to protect his employees from the wind and sun as they sit through foreclosure auctions held in a parking lot in downtown Las Vegas. More than 50 people show up daily for the auctions, about triple from the year earlier, says Mr. Griffin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin represents and advises scores of investors who are trying to buy foreclosures here. Among Mr. Griffin's regular clients is Rutt Premsrirut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Last summer you could make good margins," said Mr. Premsrirut. At so-called trustee sales of homes in foreclosure cases, he could win with bids at around 70% of the estimated market value. Now, he says, with more bidders, homes are likely to go for 85% to 90% of resale value. After accounting for real-estate commissions, repairs and other costs, that leaves little margin for error.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also competing with the investors is Mr. Pawlak, head of community-resources management for Clark County, which includes Las Vegas. Mr. Pawlak leads a team charged with spending about $30 million of state and federal money awarded to the county to purchase foreclosed homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal money comes from the $6 billion Neighborhood Stabilization Program created by Congress in 2008. That program is supposed to help local organizations buy and repair foreclosed homes so they don't drag down neighborhoods. Those organizations then sell or rent the homes to people with low or moderate incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pawlak says he is handicapped in vying with private investors. For one thing, federal rules require that he buy homes at a discount of at least 1% to appraised value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Appraisers are often more cautious than buyers in estimating values. He also can't make an unconditional offer because the rules require his staff to check for toxic wastes, pests and compliance with building codes, among other things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're competing against people who say, 'I'll take 50 properties, sight unseen,' and we just can't do that," Mr. Pawlak said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given strong demand from private buyers, why should the county be in the market at all? Mr. Pawlak says his program tries to ensure homes are occupied by stable owners or renters. Investors, he says, won't necessarily repair homes thoroughly and find long-term occupants with a stake in the neighborhood.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'You can't go home again," Thomas Wolfe concluded in his novel of the same name.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what if you insist on trying?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Visiting a childhood home is something that almost everybody thinks about, and many people eventually do. In fact, in more than a hundred interviews, I found that all but one of the people I talked with had gone back to visit their childhood home. At the very least, many people drive by; some stand outside and stare. Still others write letters to the current owners or are brave enough to knock on the door, requesting a few moments inside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a way to re-experience all the feelings of childhood just by being in that space," says Esther Sternberg, a rheumatologist and author of a new book, "Healing Spaces: The Science of Place and Well-Being." "There's a kind of memory that focuses on place."</p>

Bloggers are posting photos of childhood homes and lengthy stories on sites such as Apartment Therapy (apartmenttherapy.com). And on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>, some people are posting videos chronicling the search for their childhood home. One takes the viewer through a forest in Germany, and another travels along a desolate road in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While most people say they want to return simply out of curiosity, psychologists say the visits reflect a subconscious desire to bring childhood into perspective as an adult. For baby boomers stressed by aging parents and teenagers, the visits may offer a quick route back to memories of a better time -- an era when parents were healthy, families were still intact, children felt loved and the world at least seemed safer than it does now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet when adults finally arrive at their childhood homes, pleasant memories are often mixed with surprising disappointments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most homes don't measure up to the memory. For one thing, childhood homes are usually owned by strangers who have remodeled. But the memory of the original childhood home, just the way it was, never seems to lose ground in the psyche. Discovering that the house has been altered -- or worse, torn down -- can trigger much greater feelings of loss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About five years after her mother died, Dr. Sternberg, who lives in Washington, D.C., went back to see her mother's home in Montreal. She had wanted to go back for a long time and finally had the courage to drive up and ask the owner for a tour. The house had been remodeled, but the front rooms were almost identical to the way they had looked in her childhood. That gave her "a good feeling," she says, "a warm, happy feeling."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as she walked to the back of the house, she discovered the owners had ripped out the old kitchen. That was where she had made Russian pastries with her mother, using sour cherries she picked in the backyard. The space was now a mudroom for the dog. Dr. Sternberg says she had a very powerful reaction to the missing kitchen. "It was a visceral feeling of revulsion," she says. "It was something I couldn't control."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When John Beebe, a Jungian analyst in San Francisco, was invited to speak at a conference in China, he decided he would try to find the house he had lived in there as a child. His father had been a military attache in the 1940s, and Dr. Beebe remembers living in a "rather grand" house before the family was evacuated and before his parents divorced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when he finally found the spot, the house was gone. It had been replaced, in his words, by "drab communist housing." That visit -- and watching "Empire of the Sun," a World War II movie about a boy separated from, and then reunited with, his parents -- triggered overwhelming feelings of grief, Dr. Beebe recalls. "Twenty-seven years of Jungian analysis, and I didn't mourn my childhood until then," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There can be an upside to such disappointments. "A lot of people haven't fully left home," Dr. Beebe says. "Some people need to go back [in order] to move on."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others, while claiming to be "just curious" about seeing their childhood home, may have a deeper motive, he suggests: a desire to reconnect to the way they felt as a child before life -- school, careers and families -- required so many compromises. "In adapting to the world, we all lose some of our soul," Dr. Beebe says. "When we make the journey back, we find some of our soul again."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The memories of a happy childhood can prompt some people to try to buy back the past. Or at least re-create it. <span class="companylink">Walt Disney</span>, for instance, in designing his first theme park, made no secret of his desire to replicate the look and feel of his boyhood home. Thus, Marceline, Mo., became the model for Disneyland's (and, later, <span class="companylink">Walt Disney</span> World's) Main Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But again, such efforts don't always have predictable endings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allen Hammer, a management consultant, was driving through Pennsylvania on a business trip when he suddenly decided he wanted to find the family farm his grandparents had sold several years earlier -- and make an offer for the property on the spot. He and his siblings had spent most of their summers there as children, and they used to run around the fields, sneak up on deer, throw stones at groundhogs and steal eggs from the chicken coop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was a total paradise," says Mr. Hammer. His grandparents had been forced to sell the 100-acre farm for financial reasons, and he didn't even know how to find it. So he called his father from the car on his cellphone, and his father guided him through the unnamed dirt roads until he lost the connection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He finally found the property. "I just sat there, looking at it, thinking, 'This is nothing at all like I remember it,' " recalls Mr. Hammer. "It was like a slap in the face." The dark brown wood of the home had been painted a bright blue-green. The barn looked so small that he wondered how three kids had ever been able to get lost hiding in it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I was so deflated, I didn't even want to see inside," says Mr. Hammer. He drove away and dropped the idea of buying it back. Instead, he and his siblings are looking for land in Virginia with the idea of building three houses together for retirement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We want to recapture that experience in our old age. We'll be kids again," he says with a laugh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, driving up to a former home, as Mr. Hammer did, is one thing; knocking on the front door is another -- a line many people hesitate to cross.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jody Akeson, a therapist in Rockville Centre, N.Y., says she drives past the house she lived in 40 years ago every time she visits her mother in Newton, Mass. She always has the same thought: "It's beautiful. Why did I ever leave?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But she never even considers knocking on the door. "It's a boundary issue," she says. "It's not my house anymore."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners, not surprisingly, find it unsettling to see someone staring at their house from the sidewalk. One day last spring, Betsy Styron, president of a Gainesville, Fla., nonprofit, noticed a man in a baseball cap outside her home taking pictures with a cellphone. He walked a little farther down the street and circled back. Concerned, she called her husband, who went outside and said, "Hi, I'm Bob. Can I help you?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think I lived in this house for a year when I was little, but it has changed a lot," the man replied. The couple invited him in, and he introduced himself as Benmont Tench.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Styron, a huge fan of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, recognized him as the band's keyboard player. "Would you mind showing me the room where I first learned to play the piano?" Mr. Tench asked. Ms. Styron was thrilled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tench, who now lives in Los Angeles, explains that he was "too shy to knock on the door." Whenever he visited his parents' home in Gainesville, he searched for the house because he had such vivid memories of falling in love with the piano there. The visit, he says, "was a wonderful, great big wow."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last summer, a neighbor of mine in Rolling Hills, Calif., called and asked if a friend, whose family had built our house in the 1950s, could come over. I agreed, and Janet McCaman, a medical sales representative, soon arrived with her mother. The two women politely complimented me on our remodeling. Standing in our backyard, Ms. McCaman related a long string of memories: Her father, an airline pilot, built a small racing plane in our garage. She used to watch her mother put on makeup at the vanity table we had ripped out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After an hour, she thanked me and headed for the door, but her eyes filled with tears. When I called a few weeks later, she explained her feeling of loss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Other families have moved, but a lot of them have passed their homes down to their kids," she said. "It was so emotional to go back there. It just leaves me wondering, how would my life have been different if we hadn't moved?"</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the Revolution: A Family Searches for Its Past in Cuba</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you lost your home in a communist takeover, it's really difficult to go home again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My husband Dan's family fled Cuba in September 1960, almost two years after Fidel Castro took power, leaving behind a beautiful, modern home and most of their possessions. His parents, Daniel and Delia Bethencourt, an engineer and architect, had designed and built the house in Havana.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I always found it odd and surprising that no one in the family seemed to know what had happened to their house. The revolution abolished private property, but who was living there? I wanted to visit Cuba, mostly out of curiosity, but learned the hard way that the subject was strictly off-limits. My father-in-law never saw his mother again after he left the country. His anger was relentless. It became clear that we couldn't visit Cuba without deeply offending him. We couldn't even talk about it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But then a mixture of loss and politics opened the door. Dan's father passed away, and his mother now suffers from Alzheimer's. Last year, President Obama loosened restrictions on travel to Cuba, making it possible for Cuban-Americans to visit extended family. I discovered that my husband, age 56, still has an aunt and two cousins in Havana, though we knew nothing about them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I began to e-mail his cousin Noyi, and last summer we applied for visas to visit Cuba, along with our two teenagers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We arrived at the tiny Jose Marti International Airport in Havana, the scene of dozens of highly emotional reunions. Many Cuban-Americans haven't seen their close relatives for decades, and there were tears, screams and bear hugs. Dan's relatives had warned us that they wouldn't be able to meet us at the airport since they didn't own a car. Amid all the emotional reunions, that seemed just as well, since we didn't know them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late in the afternoon, we reached the rundown but charming pink home of Dan's aunt in the Vedado section of Havana. Our newly found relatives quickly embraced us, and we sat down in the spartan living room. Much to my relief, they were all extremely likeable. My husband's Aunt Noydee, now 82, turned out to have been a professor of biology. Her daughter Noyi studied engineering but now cleans the home of a priest. Her other daughter, Felymary, is an engineer who has taken up painting. Only Felymary's two children spoke English.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two days later we set out by taxi to visit Dan's childhood home, led by Noyi. As we drove, Noyi explained that because Cubans don't own their homes, few maintain the exteriors, most of which seem to be crumbling. I had read in a travel guide that many Cubans worry that those who fled the country will one day return -- and want their houses back. I wondered how the occupants of Dan's family home would react to our arrival.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Noyi turned out to have only a vague idea of the address. So we walked and walked, searching for the electric tower she and Dan vaguely remembered. Noyi told me that when my husband's parents fled the country, they hadn't told the rest of the family they were going. She used to ride her bike around their house, to see if they had returned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That's it!" Dan said suddenly. At one time, the split-level home must have been an impressive example of modern architecture, but it now seemed completely abandoned. The carport under the house had been closed off with a chain-link fence covered in rags. Noyi volunteered to go knock on the door while the rest of us watched from the street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An elderly woman in a diagonally striped housedress opened the door, just a crack, and a long conversation followed. The woman peered out at us from time to time. Finally Noyi gestured for us to walk up the steps. The woman said she had lived there for almost 50 years and Dan didn't look familiar. She shook her head vigorously and said a child named Tati had lived there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That was my sister's nickname!" Dan said excitedly in Spanish. "I'm Danielito."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The door opened a bit wider. "Ahhhh, you were the maldito!" she exclaimed in Spanish, using the term for a little devil. The woman introduced herself as Maria Ordaz and explained that she and her husband had been very close friends of Dan's parents. Dan's father had entrusted them with the house, saying the family would return soon. The two men were as close as brothers. Ms. Ordaz's husband passed away several years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As we entered the house, she explained that nothing had changed since Dan's family left in 1960. "These were your parents' chairs. This was your parents' table, everything is still here," she said. But the furniture, mostly midcentury modern in style, was now in tatters. The curtains were drawn, making the house very dark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But to Dan, who had left Cuba at age 7, the house seemed to offer an endless series of illuminations. "Those were the three steps," he said. "I remember those three steps!" My husband's Spanish, his first language, was becoming more rapid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We stayed for an hour, wandering from room to room. Our children, Daniel and Isabel, 18 and 16, were amazed to find a laptop and a poster for Slipknot, an American heavy-metal band, in a bedroom. "It's the only reminder that we're in the present," my son said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When we were ready to go, Ms. Ordaz seemed shaken. "I always knew you would come back," she told Dan in Spanish, looking at him very directly. "This is your house. If you want this house, it's yours." This was both extremely touching and shocking. How many people would offer you a house they had lived in for almost 50 years? My husband assured her we were just visiting, and we thanked her profusely and left.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That night, Ms. Ordaz called our hotel to say she had found an old photograph. We returned the next day and she handed us a curled black-and-white picture she had found in the dining room. It shows the first birthday party of Dan's brother Carlos in 1958. Ms. Ordaz and her husband are among the gathering of family and friends, and they're all standing against the once-shimmering diamond-patterned wallpaper in the dining room. Dan's brother, Carlos, is at the center, blowing out the candle on his cake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Throughout the trip, Dan had become more and more animated, but he never appeared shaken. He said it wasn't until we returned home and he found more photos of the way the home had looked in his childhood that he really felt his family's loss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We placed the two sets of pictures, then and now, side by side. The old photos show a modern split-level house with chestnut trim and two gleaming cars in the carport. The house appears so pristine it could be a real-estate ad from the 1950s. Now, the wood has turned black. The grass has grown over the stone wall in front, hiding it completely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The impact on my husband seemed more surreal than sentimental.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I realized the physical being, the life of my parents, is still there. Even their bed is still there," he said. "It's as though my childhood history is a museum. That doesn't happen to people here."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Danielle Steel is known for her uncommon houses: a 55-room mansion in San Francisco with a formal ballroom and an antique-rich library; a Paris apartment overflowing with taxidermy, including a stuffed giraffe in the entryway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it's a 3,000-square-foot cedar-shingled beach house in a low-key community on the California coast that Ms. Steel most considers home. "This is the first house I ever decorated how I liked," Ms. Steel, who has been married and divorced several times, said in a rare interview there on a recent afternoon. "I'm bolder now because I am not doing it for anyone else."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main theme seen throughout the three-bedroom, one-story home is hearts, which appear in paintings, in prints and via pillows. Reds, oranges, pinks and lime greens jump out from paintings, sculptures and objects, and heart pillows are inscribed with sayings ("Real love stories never have endings," reads one). Ms. Steel's bed, situated underneath a heart painting, is covered with heart pillows, stuffed animals and cloth dolls. "It's less grown-up than the other places," says Victoria Leonard, a San Francisco designer who has been to all of Ms. Steel's homes. "It's fun and lively and bright."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When one of Ms. Steel's ex-husbands recently came to lunch, he surveyed the decor and remarked that it was clear she wasn't planning on getting married anytime soon. Ms. Steel laughed. With no new husband on the horizon, she said she has reached a point where she is happy with her independence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's taken me a long time to get here," she said. Petite, with auburn hair in a ponytail, wearing large Chanel earrings, a puffy white down jacket and Marc Jacobs flats made to look like mice (with whiskers, ears and noses), Ms. Steel looks younger than her 62 years. "My relationships were never equitable. My husbands were always older than me, and they made the rules, they ran the show, and I followed them. Five years ago I was still willing to throw my whole life out the window -- to change my whole life for someone. Now I want a voice in it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That sentiment is echoed in her coming books, which focus on family as the central theme. In "Big Girl," due Feb. 23, an overweight girl struggles with her identity in a narcissistic family. "I'm not looking for a date, or a man, or a husband. I'm fine the way I am," says Annie, the lead character in "Family Ties," due for release June 22.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While many of her heroines end up happily attached to men, Ms. Steel doesn't like being labeled a romance novelist, noting she has also written nonfiction, poetry and children's books. Her 101 books have sold about 580 million copies world-wide. In 1989, Ms. Steel made "The Guinness Book of World Records" for having a book on The New York Times Bestseller list for 381 consecutive weeks -- a record she has since broken.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The daughter of a German father and a Portuguese mother who divorced when she was 6, Ms. Steel grew up in Paris and New York. She married her first husband, a French banker, when she was 18 and wrote her first book at 19. She proceeded to marry several more times and to raise nine children, including a son Nick, who committed suicide in 1997 at 19.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shortly after she married cruise-line executive John Traina in 1981, Ms. Steel bought a local landmark, a Beaux-Arts mansion built for sugar tycoon Adolph Spreckels. At the time she was a fixture in the San Francisco society scene, attending benefits and hosting dinners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2001, when she says her marriage to venture capitalist Tom Perkins of Kleiner, Perkins, Caulfield &amp;Byers was on the rocks, Ms. Steel decided to rent a house at the beach, because she'd always wanted one but "was never married to anyone who wanted a house there." She bought her current house in 2002 for $6.5 million, and it serves as the setting for her 2003 book "Safe Harbor." Mr. Perkins couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Steel said she rarely entertains or goes out in San Francisco anymore, and said she likes to spend time at this house with her children, playing board games or just hanging out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a very happy house," says Ms. Steel's daughter Vanessa Traina, 25, a free-lance fashion editor in New York who is often featured in Vogue. "We're a really close family and we all like to just hang out there all day." On her last visit Ms. Traina said she slept in the same room with her mom and her little sister, because Ms. Steel gave up her bedroom to another child who was there with a significant other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Steel said the beach house is purely for relaxation -- she writes at her San Francisco mansion. She doesn't entertain at the beach house -- that's what the Paris apartment is for. She dates, but says she only wants someone who is "really nice, kind and intelligent. I've done difficult and I don't want difficult again."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sign at the front door of her beach house reads "Coup de Coeur" -- literally, in French, a blow to the heart. "I believe in love at first sight for houses -- but not for people," Ms. Steel said, half joking.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. residential construction rose last month, fueled by the number of new apartment buildings. But a more muted rise in single-family housing starts underscored the housing sector's fragility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction starts climbed 2.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 591,000 homes in January, compared with December, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. Much of that increase was the result of a 9.2% jump in new construction of apartments and other multifamily dwellings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of single-family homes, which economists regard as a better measure of the underlying trend in home construction, rose 1.5% to 484,000. That was up 35.6% from a year earlier, but the monthly level has stayed within a narrow range since June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing market has bottomed, and prospects have brightened, but overall, the recovery remains very moderate," said <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span> economist Anna Piretti. Tight credit conditions continue to weigh on the housing sector, she noted, and builders are competing with a continuing glut of houses on the market as a result of foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regionally, housing starts last month climbed 1% in the South, 10% in the Northeast and 8.9% in the West. Construction fell 3.2% in the Midwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Permits for new construction fell 4.9% in January to a 621,000 annual rate, possibly because builders rushed to take out permits at the end of 2009 in expectation of higher permit costs this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate government report showed U.S. import prices rose for the sixth-straight month in January, largely as a result of a sharp increase in volatile oil prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices of imports rose a greater-than-expected 1.4% in January, compared with December, after increasing an upwardly revised 0.2% in December, the Labor Department reported Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fuel import prices rose 5.3% in January, accounting for around three-quarters of the overall import price increase. Excluding fuel prices, import prices rose 0.4% in January.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. home construction and industrial production both rose in January, government reports showed Wednesday, providing further evidence of the economy's gradual recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts climbed 2.8% to a seasonally adjusted 591,000 annual rate compared with the prior month as builders recovered from a bout of bad weather, the Commerce Department said. However, new building permits dropped, a sign the housing sector is improving slowly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report showed manufacturers continued to lead the recovery, with industrial production rising for the seventh-straight month and by more than expected in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast a 5.9% increase in January housing starts. The pace of 591,000 was the strongest since July 2009. Housing starts have gone up three times in the past six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family permits, the key number in the housing report, and apartment construction both rose in January. In another positive sign, December starts were revised up, falling 0.7% instead of the 4% drop that was reported originally. Bad weather slowed builders in December, when permits had surged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Both starts and permits are on track to rise this quarter, which could lead to a small increase in real residential investment spending by the second quarter," said Abiel Reinhart, economist at <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing sector, one of the worst hit during the recent recession, has been slowly improving. Year over year, housing starts in the U.S. last month were 21.1% higher than the pace of construction in January 2009, which was the pit of the economy's downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month's single-family housing starts compared with December rose 1.5%, to 484,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartment construction -- housing with two or more units -- rose 9.2%, to 107,000. Within that multifamily category, groundbreakings of homes with five or more units were 17.6% higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regionally, housing starts last month climbed 1% in the South, 10% in the Northeast, and 8.9% in the West. Construction fell 3.2% in the Midwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve said that industrial production rose 0.9% in January as car and parts output surged. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had expected a 0.8% increase. Car and parts output rose 4.9%. Excluding autos, production in all other industry increased 0.9%. Utilities output rose by 0.7%. Utilities capacity use increased to 83.1% from 82.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. economy expanded for the second consecutive quarter in the final three months of 2009, boosted by inventories and the government's stimulus measures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The growth in exports and the inventory swing should sustain the solid performance in manufacturing throughout the first half of 2010," said Thomas Duesterberg, president of the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the U.S. economy's recovery in place, investors are starting to pay more attention to readings on inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate government report Wednesday showed U.S. import prices rose for the sixth-straight month and by more than expected in January, led by sharply higher oil and gas prices. Prices of goods imported into the U.S. rose by 1.4% in January compared with December. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had expected a 1% gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fuel import prices rose 5.3%, accounting for around three quarters of the increase in all import prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another surprising twist, food prices rose by 1.3%, the largest increase in five months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside of volatile energy and food prices, however, there have been few signs that inflation is heating up, giving the Fed continued reason to keep interest rates low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed will get more readings on inflation when the government releases the closely watched January producer and consumer prices Thursday and Friday, respectively.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Justin Lahart                And Jeff Bater   </div><div>389 words</div><div>18 February 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. residential construction rose last month, fueled by the number of new apartment buildings. But a more muted rise in single-family housing starts underscored the housing sector's fragility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction starts climbed 2.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 591,000 homes in January, compared with December, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. Much of that increase was the result of a 9.2% jump in new construction of apartments and other multifamily dwellings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of single-family homes, which economists regard as a better measure of the underlying trend in home construction, rose 1.5% to 484,000. That was up 35.6% from a year earlier, but the monthly level has stayed within a narrow range since June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing market has bottomed, and prospects have brightened, but overall, the recovery remains very moderate," said <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span> economist Anna Piretti. Tight credit conditions continue to weigh on the housing sector, she noted, and builders are competing with a continuing glut of houses on the market as a result of foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regionally, housing starts last month climbed 1% in the South, 10% in the Northeast and 8.9% in the West. Construction fell 3.2% in the Midwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Permits for new construction fell 4.9% in January to a 621,000 annual rate, possibly because builders rushed to take out permits at the end of 2009 in expectation of higher permit costs this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate government report showed U.S. import prices rose for the sixth-straight month in January, largely as a result of a sharp increase in volatile oil prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices of imports rose a greater-than-expected 1.4% in January, compared with December, after increasing an upwardly revised 0.2% in December, the Labor Department reported Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fuel import prices rose 5.3% in January, accounting for around three-quarters of the overall import price increase. Excluding fuel prices, import prices rose 0.4% in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Import prices rose 11.5% for the year ended in January, the largest annual gain since September 2007. Excluding fuel prices, import prices were 1.3% above their year-earlier level.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sara Murray and Robert Guy Matthews </div><div>1091 words</div><div>18 February 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturers are seeing more signs that the U.S. economic recovery is on a solid footing, opening the way for new hiring as well as call-backs for factory workers laid off during the depths of the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Caterpillar Inc</span>., the Peoria, Ill.-based heavy-equipment maker, has brought back 600 workers in the past 60 days, including 100 recalled to an engine plant in Indiana last week. <span class="companylink">Allen Edmonds Shoe Corp</span>. has been relying on overtime to meet growing demand, but is now preparing to start adding new workers at its U.S. plants in coming weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that industrial production, which includes utility and mining output, as well as manufacturing, rose 0.9% in January, the seventh straight monthly increase. Factory output rose a solid 1%, with improvement across a wide range of industries, including apparel and appliances. Output of motor vehicles and parts was particularly strong, rising 4.9%, which economists attributed to pent-up demand and government incentives that fueled traffic to dealers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Factories have been a relative bright spot so far in this recovery, last month adding 11,000 jobs on a seasonally adjusted basis. That's the first increase since before the downturn began more than two years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But manufacturers remain cautious, and some still fear a secondary slump, especially if a broader recovery -- which will rely on still-elusive job creation in the wider economy and a stronger revival of consumer spending -- is delayed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Reserve officials' latest forecast, released Wednesday with the minutes of the Fed's January policy meeting, found that most of them expect very little downward movement in the unemployment rate, now at 9.7%, for the rest of this year. They anticipate a painfully slow decline in unemployment to between 8.2% and 8.5% at the end of 2011, and between 6.6% and 7.5% at the end of 2012, significantly above the 5% level that they consider full employment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed officials, while beginning to plot their exit from unusually low interest rates and other unusual monetary stimulus, continue "to expect the pace of the economic recovery will be restrained by housing and business uncertainty" as well as "only gradual improvement in labor market conditions" and "slow easing" of the credit crunch, the minutes said. A "sizeable minority" of Fed officials say it could take "more than five or six years" for the economy to fully recover from the deep recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home-building industry, while still depressed, is improving -- but only gradually. The Commerce Department said builders began work on 1.5% more new homes in January than in December, on a seasonally adjusted basis. But the number of new building permits rose a very slight 0.4%, after much stronger increases in November and December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturers, which currently employ about 9% of all American workers outside of farming, are chipper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are seeing demand starting to come back," says Scott Wine, chief executive officer of Medina, Minn.-based <span class="companylink">Polaris Industries Inc</span>., which produces snowmobiles and other off-road vehicles. But, he added, "we're trying to look at ways to make sure we don't go out and get ahead of ourselves in terms of hiring and expenditures."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wine says he worries that the sales revival he's seeing could stall out and, even in the best case, he is expecting a "muted recovery."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Polaris is evaluating whether to add workers. Currently, it has employees working overtime to keep up with the increase in demand. Factories in January were operating at 69.2% of capacity, the Fed said, up 0.8 percentage points from December, but well below the 79.2% average of the past four decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among manufacturers, the picture is uneven. <span class="companylink">Deere &amp;Co</span>., which reported strong fiscal first-quarter earnings on Wednesday and increased its earnings forecast for the year, said that even with an improving economic outlook, it is not moving to hire. "We are not doing any significant rehiring," says Ken Golden, a company spokesman, adding the company has recalled some workers in some U.S. plants. "Twenty or thirty people here or there," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others have been more willing to add workers. At Allen Edmonds, which specializes in traditional men's shoes, business started perking up in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first, Chief Executive Paul Granguard says he thought it might be a fluke. But business kept picking up in November, and by December, the company's two U.S. factories were working overtime to meet demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We depleted our inventories much faster than we expected and ended up working overtime in December just to catch up, and have been working overtime ever since," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company, whose shoes retail for an average of $250, retrenched significantly after the financial crisis and currently has about 400 workers. Sales are up 14% so far this year, says Mr. Granguard, and the company is going to start by hiring about 10 people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're going to do this step-by-step," he says. The company aims to reduce but not eliminate the need for overtime at his plants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russian steelmaker <span class="companylink">Severstal</span> is reopening its U.S.-based plants, including operations in Warren, Ohio, and is ramping up its coke-making facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We feel comfortable saying that we will be operating at 80% capacity in 2010," says Sergei Kuznetsov, chief executive officer of its North American operations. On average, domestic steelmakers operated at about 50% to 70% of capacity in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The manufacturing sector's recent growth is being amplified by the move to refill inventories, a trend that likely will wane as pipelines are replenished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Craig LaBarge, chief executive of <span class="companylink">LaBarge Inc</span>., which produces electronics used in everything from medical devices to military equipment, is feeling more upbeat than he has in a while. "Order inflow has really improved compared to a year ago," he says. "The thing that's hard for us to determine in some of the markets is how much of this is just inventory replenishment and how much is real and market demand."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LaBarge, based in St. Louis, is slowly hiring workers and hopes to add an additional 80 to 85 to its 1,500 work force over the next six to 12 months. "Every day that goes by we get a bit more comfortable," Mr. LaBarge says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HONG KONG -- As some of Wall Street's biggest real-estate investors weigh their next steps in China after a bruising downturn, a rush of domestic players are filling the void, raising money and snapping up trophy properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest proof: <span class="companylink">Shanghai Forte Land Co</span>. agreed last week to pay $328 million to a real-estate principal investment arm of <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>. for 100% of a luxury gated residential community called Shanghai Garden Plaza.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Domestic investors -- including listed developers, private-equity players and wealthy individuals -- were buyers in 83% of the deals larger than 100 million yuan ($14.6 million) last year, excluding land transactions, according to real-estate brokers <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2005, foreign buyers took 80% of such deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aggressive domestic competitors are raising onshore bank debt, attracting investment from China's growing pool of domestic investors and moving nimbly to land deals through their network of contacts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign investors, by contrast, typically have a lower tolerance for risk, require approval on deals, and need to get capital in and out through China's tight currency controls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Real estate is a highly restricted and regulated industry, and the Chinese government has made it increasingly difficult for foreign investors to do deals in recent years," says Joel Rothstein, a Beijing-based partner with the law firm of Paul Hastings, Janofsky &amp;Walker LLP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you want to go into a tier-one city, good luck trying to compete against domestic money that can access bank financing and does not have to go through the foreign investor approval process."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fresh competition has helped stir up a froth in China's property market that some experts warn is an emerging bubble. Land values nationally have increased 106% in the past year, according to Stephen Green, Shanghai-based head of research for Standard Chartered Bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past year, foreign funds largely sat on the sidelines licking wounds from problems back home. They also suffered from market volatility. Values fell sharply a few years ago, although they are now bouncing back strongly on the back of government stimulus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The past year has shown that having local expertise and backing is a key factor of success in the Chinese real-estate sector," says Jiang Wei, vice chairman of Harvest Capital and a China Resources vice president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The domestic players also are raising local money to compete. Shanghai Forte, which did the Goldman deal in Shanghai, raised 550 million yuan from wealthy mainland individuals last year for a fund that co-invests alongside Forte's development projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That fund has invested more than 40% of its proceeds in two recent residential projects in the second-tier cities of Chengdu and Nanjing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Goldman spokeswoman declined to comment on the Shanghai deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another source of competition is the domestic insurance industry, which had a law changed in 2008 making it easier to invest in property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Ping An Insurance (Group) Co. of China Ltd</span>., one of China's biggest insurers, is plowing 25 billion yuan in Chinese property over the next three years through a trust, partnering with two major developers on new projects. In one of its first deals, Ping An's trust invested 1.6 billion yuan last year in a Shanghai development with domestically listed Gemdale Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As domestic players gain more clout, non-Chinese real-estate funds are looking for new ways to stay competitive in one of the world's most promising long-term markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One possible model for foreigners looking to ramp up again in China is being employed by Prax Capital Management Co., a U.S. private-equity firm with its head office in Shanghai.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Prax became one of the first foreign firms to win approval to raise a fund denominated in the domestic yuan. Its Prax Capital (Tianjin) Real Estate Fund closed at 594 million yuan last year, targeting residential development projects in second-tier cities like a 410,000-square-meter residential complex in Anhui province's Wuhu city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prax didn't respond to requests for comment.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Alison Tudor   </div><div>1057 words</div><div>17 February 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TOKYO—<span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> may have to hand over the keys of a $2.4 billion Japanese hotel chain to creditors when the debt falls due in April, people familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> was among the most aggressive buyers of real estate in Japan and globally during the property boom last decade. Now, many of those deals made at the top of the market are dogging the U.S. investment bank as property values plummet and refinancing options remain scant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main lenders in the Japanese hotel purchase, <span class="companylink">Citigroup Inc</span>. and Japan's <span class="companylink">Shinsei Bank Ltd</span>., are pushing <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> to put more equity in the property to give the devalued holdings more security, but the company has hesitated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A third lender—sovereign-wealth fund <span class="companylink">Government of Singapore Investment Corp</span>., or GIC—has expressed interest in taking over the full-service hotels from <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> and is discussing terms with the other lenders, one of the people said. <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>'s equity investment would be wiped out in the settlement, the people said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June 2007, the <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley Real Estate Funds</span> unit, known in the industry as MSREF, completed the acquisition of 13 hotels and two property-management units known as ANA from <span class="companylink">All Nippon Airways Co</span>. for 281.3 billion yen, or $2.4 billion at the time. That was shortly before property values started to fall in Japan. The biggest hotel in the chain is the ANA InterContinental Tokyo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The talks between <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> and its creditors are continuing and nothing has been decided yet, but the debt deadline is looming. There has been no resolution to date because the bankers were keen to see <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> put more equity into the hotels but were afraid of pushing the U.S. investment bank into walking away, leaving the lenders in charge of the assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>, one of the most active real-estate deal makers during the boom, has been putting out fires around the world. In the U.S., the bank last year walked away from its $6.5 billion acquisition of real-estate developer <span class="companylink">Crescent Real Estate Equities Co</span>. and lost the former Maui Prince Hotel in Hawaii to foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MSREF VI International, an $8.8 billion <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> fund that invested in the ANA chain, has suffered steep declines in value across its portfolio. By September 2009, the value of the Montana Board of Investments' $27.5 million stake in the fund had dwindled to $3.9 million, the board reported last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ANA refinancing comes at a delicate time, particularly for Shinsei, which is in talks to merge with its Japanese peer <span class="companylink">Aozora Bank Ltd</span>. Negotiations on that deal have stalled partly because Aozora is worried about Shinsei's capitalization, which is lower than its own, people familiar with the matter have said. Shinsei is reviewing its portfolio of loans including domestic real-estate-related lending. Japan's financial regulator is also conducting a routine inspection of the Tokyo-based bank's loan book and has called for strict markdowns even on senior debt, a person familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>'s fraught negotiations illustrate a wider trend in Asia's largest property market. Bankers aggressively pushed real-estate loans in Japan from 2004 to 2007. The loans were often repackaged and sold to other banks. The flood of loans encouraged property funds to bid ever-higher prices for hotels, ski resorts and office space across Japan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Near the height of the boom, <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> announced its biggest push yet into the Japanese market, the package of ANA hotels. The deal was the biggest hotel acquisition by value on record in the Asian-Pacific region and one of the largest property-related acquisitions in the region, according to data provider Dealogic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> and Shinsei lent Morgan about 180 billion yen in senior debt to make the purchase. GIC provided mezzanine financing, a mix of debt and equity, which is next in line to get wiped out after <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>'s equity if the Singapore fund doesn't do something to protect its stake, said the people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>'s property business was one of the bank's biggest revenue generators in Japan at the time of the hotels' acquisition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Japanese real-estate bubble popped when the financial crisis erupted in the U.S. and investment banks sharply curtailed new lending. Many banks trying to pass loans onward in a process called syndication were stuck with the soured debt on their books.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now many of the real-estate loans taken out during the go-go years are maturing. Delinquency rates are climbing world-wide, but the problem may become more acute in Japan, even though the market is relatively new and small, because commercial-mortgage-backed securities loans typically have a shorter lifespan there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Japan, CMBS loans are usually due in about three years, compared with five to seven years in Europe and about a decade in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ANA hotel refinancing will be closely watched for any formal revaluation of large assets and an indication of how quickly the Japanese property market will recover, the people familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The day-to-day operations may not be affected as the hotels are still operated by a joint venture between the airline and the <span class="companylink">InterContinental Hotels Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 1998, <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> has spent about two trillion yen on Japanese real estate, a good chunk of which it used to buy hotels. GIC has already bought one property from the U.S. investment bank; in 2008, it purchased the 438-room five-star Westin Tokyo for $722 million. <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> is in talks to sell one of its other hotels, the Hyatt Regency Hakone, to a buyer from Asia, said people familiar with the matter, who declined to identify the prospective purchaser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>'s real-estate-investing arm is excluded from the company's talks to merge its Japanese brokerage arm with <span class="companylink">Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group</span>.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chrysler's bankruptcy estate is seeking to sell a Twinsburg, Ohio, factory for $27.5 million, part of an effort to raise money to repay creditors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In papers filed Saturday with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, the old Chrysler that remains in bankruptcy said it struck a deal to sell the 2.4-million-square-foot stamping plant to an entity called Twinsburg Industrial Park LLC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chrysler estate wants the offer to serve as the lead bid for the plant at a court-supervised auction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bid "was the most attractive offer" among "numerous indications of interest" for the property, old Chrysler said in court papers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bankruptcy estate began to market the property in October 2009 and has received multiple competing offers resulting in "steadily increasing cash consideration."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plant produces roofs, hoods and other parts for several vehicles, including the Dodge Ram, Chrysler Town &amp;Country and Jeep Liberty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chrysler Group LLC, the part of the auto maker that emerged from bankruptcy protection last year, has continued to operate the plant on a contract basis, but that deal expires on July 31.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At that point, the plant will be vacated and $2.4 million in annual upkeep costs will fall to the bankruptcy estate unless a buyer is found, according to court papers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A hearing to determine if Twinsburg Industrial Park's offer can serve as the lead bid at auction is scheduled for Feb. 25.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With court approval, an auction would be scheduled for March 10, with a sale hearing the next day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chrysler bankruptcy estate is also seeking permission to pay the proposed purchaser a $600,000 breakup fee should it be bested at auction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Court papers didn't offer any details about the purchasing entity, other than listing a Cleveland address.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Chrysler spokesman and a Twinsburg city official said they didn't know the buyer's intentions for the factory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plant, built in 1957, employs about 600 workers and sits on 165 acres of land in northern Ohio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposed deal is part of a larger effort to sell off Chrysler assets left in bankruptcy in order to repay creditors.</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>437 words</div><div>12 February 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices rose in more than a third of U.S. metropolitan areas in the fourth quarter, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday as it pointed to a "broad stabilization" of values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for single-family home resales was up from a year earlier in 67 of the 151 U.S. metropolitan areas included in the trade group's quarterly survey. But other housing analysts said the home-price trend depends heavily on any recovery in the job market and on the pace of foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national median price for single-family homes was $172,900 in the fourth quarter, down 4.1% from a year earlier. That was the smallest decline in more than two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among metro areas showing the biggest gains from a year earlier were Cleveland (25%), Akron, Ohio, (23%) and San Francisco (13%). Those increases don't denote a general surge in home values but rather show that sales of foreclosed homes at fire-sale prices made up a smaller percentage of overall sales than a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosures dominated some markets a year ago. Nationwide, "distressed property," including foreclosures and homes at risk of foreclosure, accounted for 32% of fourth-quarter transactions, down from 37% a year earlier, the Realtors estimated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Metro areas showing big price declines included Orlando, Fla., (down 20%) and Ocala, Fla., and Las Vegas (both down 23%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For condominiums, the median resale price in the quarter for 54 metro areas surveyed was $177,300, down 4.8% from a year earlier. Eleven of the metro areas showed higher condo prices, and the rest showed declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One major worry is that price drops have left many people with no equity in their homes. Homeowners who owe more than the value of their homes are more likely to abandon them if their incomes fall or they lose their jobs. That would create more foreclosures, weighing on prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of 2009, 21% of households with mortgages on single-family homes owed more than the current value of their homes, according to a new estimate from <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span>, a real-estate data provider.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">State and federal efforts to avert or delay foreclosures by offering borrowers easier terms have created a huge backlog of unresolved cases, likely to lead to an eventual bulge in the supply of foreclosed homes. As of Dec. 31, about 3.9% of first-lien home mortgages were 120 days or more overdue but still not in the foreclosure process, according to LPS Applied Analytics.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kris Hudson and Rachel Emma Silverman </div><div>1165 words</div><div>11 February 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>7</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seven months before Melvin Simon died, the ailing shopping-mall magnate altered his $1 billion will during a three-hour meeting in Asherwood, his palatial home near Indianapolis. A financial adviser had to hold and guide his hand as he signed the revised document, according to court filings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that scene has become the center of a bitter estate struggle pitting Mr. Simon's second wife, Bren Simon, whose inheritance was greatly increased by the new will, against his children from his first marriage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deborah Simon, Mr. Simon's eldest daughter, says the assistance her sick father got to sign the document was evidence that he did so under duress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Simon "did not have sufficient capacity to know the extent and value of his property, those who were the natural objects of his bounty [or] their desserts with respect to their treatment", she said in a court document filed last month to contest the will.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Bren Simon, who was present at the signing of the disputed will, said in a filing that "Melvin made his own voluntary decisions . . . for sound and rational reasons, after again receiving independent advice." She said that her husband requested that someone guide his hand at the fateful meeting because he didn't want to sign the document with an "X".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The battle over the will of Melvin Simon, who died in September of cancer at the age of 82, has riveted Indianapolis high society and dragged in <span class="companylink">Simon Property Group Inc</span>., the largest mall owner in the country, which Mr. Simon founded. His son, David Simon, is now its chairman and chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Melvin Simon, who according to court papers left an estate worth more than $1 billion, also was well known for donating to charities, owning the Indiana Pacers basketball team and occasionally financing comedic movies such as "Porky's" and "Zorro, the Gay Blade." Mr. Simon is survived by Bren Simon, 66, whom he married in 1972; his three children from his first marriage, David, Deborah and Cindy Simon Skjodt; and Bren's daughter, Tamme McCauley Simon, whom he adopted when she was 40, according to the court filings. David and Cindy haven't filed in the court case, although they are represented by the same lawyers as Deborah Simon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts don't think the outcome of the struggle will have an impact on control of <span class="companylink">Simon Property</span>, which owns more than 300 malls, because the Simon family owns less than 13% of the company's shares. Much of that stake is held jointly by Melvin Simon; his son, David; and Melvin Simon's brother, Herb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But <span class="companylink">Simon Property</span> has become a combatant. The company recently refused Bren Simon's request to convert 6.5 million of Melvin Simon's operating units -- a kind of founder's shares -- to common stock, explaining that the shares are subject to Deborah Simon's legal challenge of the will.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The battle over Mr. Simon's will joins a list of high-profile estate contests among the super-rich, involving accusations that a senior family member may not have fully understood what was at stake when signing estate-planning documents. For instance, in the recent case of society doyenne Brooke Astor, her son, Anthony Marshall, was convicted last year of defrauding his mother as she struggled in her last years with Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In her court papers, Bren Simon said Melvin Simon's new will was necessary because the value of the estate had "diminished substantially" after a fall in <span class="companylink">Simon Property</span>'s share price. Meanwhile, David Simon's decision to cut the company's dividend, she said, reduced her cash flow. The late changes to the will "reflected an effort to compensate" Bren Simon for her cut inheritance, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The court papers show tensions have simmered for some time. Bren Simon's papers alleged that David Simon "rebuffed" an earlier attempt to have his stepmother appointed to a board overseeing the family's interests in <span class="companylink">Simon Property</span>. She also alleged that Melvin Simon was concerned "that the children might not be fair or equitable to Bren Simon if the children were left with an ability to impact Bren's financial situation".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Simon and the attorney representing Deborah Simon declined to comment for this article.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The previous version of Melvin Simon's will, in place for 10 years, set aside one-third of his estate for Bren Simon. Another third was to be distributed to his grown children after Bren Simon's death, with the income going to Bren Simon in the meantime. Charity was to get the final third, with Melvin Simon's four children -- including Tamme -- determining over a 15-year period which causes got the money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That plan was changed in the wake of the Feb. 13, 2009, meeting. The new will decrees that half of the estate go to Bren Simon upon her husband's death. The other half would go, after Bren's death, into charitable trusts -- with the children getting anything left over from that half 12 to 15 years thereafter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Under this new estate plan, Bren would receive hundreds of millions of dollars more than Melvin had previously intended to provide" and "the inheritance of [his children] would be dramatically reduced," Deborah Simon said in her filing. Deborah Simon is also suing to remove her stepmother as the estate's trustee in favor of a bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While challenges to wills are common, proving that malfeasance occurred isn't easy. In general, those granting inheritances in a will don't have to have a high level of capacity to draft the instructions; they need to know what their property is, how they want it distributed and who their relatives are. In some cases, mental capacity to create a will doesn't have to be as high as the standard to execute a contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he changed his will, Melvin Simon suffered from neurological disorders that "impaired his language, reading, writing, cognition, memory and understanding", according to his daughter's court papers. Bren Simon denied in her papers that his medical conditions were serious enough to prevent him conducting his financial affairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two sides also are fighting over whether Melvin Simon was adequately represented when he signed his new will. Deborah Simon's court papers noted that attorney Eric Manterfield and Bruce Jacobson, an accountant and financial adviser to Melvin and Bren Simon, were present at the signing. But neither Messrs. Manterfield nor Jacobson provided Melvin with any documents summarizing his assets or how their distribution would be changed before or after the meeting, Deborah Simon's papers state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bren Simon said in her papers that Melvin Simon was extensively advised of the changes. Mr. Manterfield declined to comment. Mr. Jacobson didn't return calls seeking comment.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Dawn Wotapka  </div><div>968 words</div><div>10 February 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders are ramping up speculative construction to attract last-minute home buyers who want to tap a soon-to-expire tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strategy is risky. If the buyers don't materialize, builders could be saddled with unsold homes that will require heavy discounting to sell, hurting profits and slowing the housing recovery. New homes may also continue to lose market share to lower-priced foreclosed houses. Indeed, some economists expect an avalanche of foreclosures in the months ahead as lenders release homes they have been keeping off the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that's a chance the industry is willing to take. "We know that we're going to have more people out now," says Lance Wright, co-owner of CastleRock Communities in Houston, Texas. "Buying is an emotional decision. Seeing the actual product that you're moving into will certainly make it easier."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ken Campbell, chief executive of California-based <span class="companylink">Standard Pacific Corp</span>., agrees. Buyers trying to beat the tax credit's expiration "will buy a house somewhere," he says. "It does make a difference if the home is ready, available to go."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late last year, builders lost sales because they didn't have enough houses to satisfy a flurry of demand from buyers looking to take advantage of a federal tax credit for first-time buyers before they expired on Nov. 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some experts believe that those credits have satisfied the urge of potential buyers to jump into the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They did the job," says Christopher Thornberg, a principal at Beacon Economics, a Los Angeles-based research firm. "They stabilized the market. Now, let the program go."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that hasn't happened. Instead, the tax credit has been extended and expanded. The current credit, which offers first-time buyers up to $8,000 and repeat purchasers up to $6,500, applies only to deals signed by April 30 and closed by June 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders expect buyers will wait until the last minute. "As we roll into March and April, more people are going to become aware of the fact that there's a deadline, and it's for real," says Rob Bowman, president of Lancaster, Pa.-based Charter Homes &amp;Neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houses typically take between four and six months to build, so the window to start construction is closing quickly. And current inventory is low. At the end of 2009, there were 234,000 homes for sale, the lowest level since April 1971, according to the National Association of Home Builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's difficult to measure the total number of spec homes nationwide. But according to a survey conducted by John Burns Real Estate Consulting, based in Irvine, Calif., home builders have about three finished homes with no buyer per community. That's up slightly from 2.8 finished homes in November but much lower than the peak of six finished homes in July 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Every builder I talk to around the county is starting a spec home or two [per community] for the spring season, provided they have the cash to do it," said Jody Kahn, a John Burns vice president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But not everyone. <span class="companylink">Pulte Homes Inc</span>., the nation's largest builder, has 2,800 spec homes in inventory and doesn't plan to add more, even if it has to "sacrifice a few sign-ups and closings in the short term," Chief Executive Richard Dugas said in an earnings conference call Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We got caught with a lot of inventory at a bad time in the market, it depressed our margins dramatically, and we're not going back there, God willing," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">KB Home</span>, the nation's fifth-largest builder by annual closings, has been among the most vocal proponents of not building on spec. Like all builders, the company was hurt during the housing bust, which left them with too many high-priced homes that had to be sold at a discount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even KB has said it will now build a limited number of spec homes in select markets and communities. It plans to build the houses about half way through, to the drywall phase, allowing enough time for buyers to personalize finishes, such as cabinet and carpet colors, and still close in time for the credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charter Homes also considers itself a build-to-order builder, but it is currently building some 20 speculative homes, about 8% of this year's expected deliveries. It is selecting the most popular colors and upgrades, and every home will include a natural stone countertop on the kitchen island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"No matter how tough times are, that's still a luxury that most people look at and say, 'That's something I really want,'" says Mr. Bowman, the company's president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders say they're being careful, studying each community to determine demand and what price point and bedroom count will sell most quickly. And they're building just a few spec houses per neighborhood. <span class="companylink">Meritage Homes Corp</span>.'s average in its 153 communities is 3.4, down from 4.3 a year ago, Brent Anderson, vice president of investor relations, says. Additional starts still require corporate review from the Scottsdale, Ariz., home office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the housing frenzy, builders quickly sold everything they built. But when the bubble popped, they were overwhelmed with a glut of speculative homes, as well as with cancellations. The homes were oversized with too many features that didn't match downsized buying preferences, forcing steep price cuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders responded by scaling back construction, building simpler homes and switching to a build-to-order strategy. Now, with many public and regional private builders increasing construction, inventory should climb during a "spring selling season on steroids," says Ms. Kahn.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">LaSalle Investment Management</span> is seeking local partners to invest in Australian property developments and boost returns for its $3 billion opportunity fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">LaSalle Investment Management</span>, the investment arm of real-estate-services firm <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>, is also chasing distressed assets in Japan and has two deals in the pipeline, Ian Mackie, LaSalle's Asian-Pacific chief investment officer, said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In some countries such as Japan at the moment, we can buy standing assets and make the sort of returns appealing to an opportunity fund," Mr. Mackie told reporters. "We would expect to go further out on a risk curve in Australia and become involved in development projects."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mackie said the firm was looking to jointly invest with Australian developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Australian Financial Review reported this month that LaSalle was in talks to back the development of the 800 million Australian dollar ($691.7 million) tower in Sydney, being undertaken by private group Grocon. Mr. Mackie declined to comment on the news report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property sales in Australia fell to A$7.2 billion in 2009 from A$9.7 billion the year before, according to research firm CBRE. Tight credit made it hard to fund transactions, but massive capital raisings by listed property trusts helped prevent distressed assets from flooding the Australian market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LaSalle has raised a $3 billion opportunity fund, $1 billion of which has been deployed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Australia, LaSalle holds only two assets, worth about $700 million, through its core fund, which only invests in existing buildings and seeks lower and stable returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Japan, LaSalle is working on two investments: a large office building deal expected to close in a couple of weeks and a resort project that came from a distressed development group, Mr. Mackie said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toronto -- Dominic Carrasco first tried to sell his studio apartment here in January 2009. The only offers the 42-year-old massage therapist got were well below the 166,900 Canadian dollars he'd paid for it five years earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, Mr. Carrasco tried again. The condominium was snapped up by the woman in charge of posting the information to the real-estate listing site, for C$209,900, or US$196,150 -- 40% more than the highest bid last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I couldn't believe it," says Mr. Carrasco, who says he's both relieved and unsettled by his change in fortune. "If my condo can go up that much in one year, it doesn't make sense."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the U.S. struggles to get out of its housing slump, its neighbor to the north faces a different challenge: Canada's housing recovery has been so rapid that some here are worrying about a bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last Wednesday, a housing-price index for Canada's six biggest cities posted its seventh straight monthly gain, showing home prices in November are now back to their prerecession peak. Another broader measure shows the average home price in 2009 hitting a record. Home building has picked up too, with housing starts in January rising for a fourth straight month to their highest level since October 2008, according to figures released Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's finance officials say they're watching home prices carefully. The finance minister in December outlined steps he can take to cool things down, if needed. The central bank last month said it is watching the booming market with "vigilance, but not alarm."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some observers foresee trouble. "It's a mania. It's going to end badly," says Garth Turner, a former cabinet member who just published a book predicting that prices of real estate and other assets will fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several other nations have taken action over concerns that their real-estate markets are heating up too quickly. In China, a housing boom has been lifting property prices at a 20% annual rate, helping fuel economic expansion of more than 8% in 2009. As evidence of a Chinese real-estate bubble mounts, the government there has tightened controls on bank lending. In South Korea, record-low interest rates led to frenzied home buying, and the government last year lowered the maximum amount that would-be homeowners can borrow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Canada, nearly 40% of gross domestic product historically is generated by exports, mainly to the U.S., where economic weakness persists. To stimulate its economy, the government has focused on the domestic slice. In an effort to boost internal consumption, it has kept a key interest rate near zero -- resulting in exceptionally low mortgages rates -- and has offered various financial incentives and tax credits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers have responded. Average home prices in Canada have risen 23% from their trough in January 2009. Home-sales volumes are up 70% over the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada never had the kind of bubble created by risky "subprime" home loans that the U.S. had, thanks in part to conservative lending practices. The S&amp;P Case-Shiller index -- a U.S. index of home prices in 20 cities -- more than doubled between January 2000 and late 2006, then fell 33% during the economic slump. In Canada, a similar home-price index of six major cities rose 90% between 2000 and mid-2008, but fell only 9% during the slump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone agrees that Canada's recent price increases are cause for concern. Bubble skeptics say they aren't yet seeing other symptoms of froth such as speculative buying, looser lending standards or a run-up in land prices. Canada's central bank and finance ministry say there isn't currently any reason for alarm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some economists who are concerned point out that home prices are rising far faster than other measures of economic health. The 2009 price increase of more than 20% came as personal income in Canada fell nearly 1% and total employment was 1.4% lower than the year earlier. In a December report, the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> warned that household debt -- largely mortgages -- was 1.42 times disposable income during the second quarter of 2009, a record high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another possible danger: Because Canadian banks typically reset adjustable-rate mortgages every few years, those who are buying now at low rates will likely see increases soon. <span class="companylink">Toronto-Dominion Bank</span> forecasts suggest that the rate to which many Canadian mortgages are pegged, the prime rate, could nearly double by the end of 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> warned in its December report that if interest rates increase as expected, by mid-2012 about 9% of Canadian households could have so much debt that they'd be "financially vulnerable."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is exactly what happened in the U.S., when affordability had moved way out of whack with prices," says David Rosenberg, an economist who witnessed America's housing bubble at <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span> in New York, and now sees similar trends up north from his post at Toronto-based wealth-management firm Gluskin Sheff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian housing market's roller-coaster ride began in September 2008 with the collapse of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> in the U.S. and the freeze in global credit markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brad Lamb says his Toronto real-estate firm noticed a drop in buyers. Sales volume plummeted and the company lost money, he says. Heather Holmes, one of his top agents, says that at one point she was handling 17 sellers at the same time, but had only a trickle of offers, at well below asking prices. To supplement income, she started handling rentals. "There was a lot of fear," she recalls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vaughn Gray, one of her clients, had agreed to buy a one-bedroom apartment the week Lehman collapsed. As he was completing the paperwork, his mortgage agent called with a request to increase his down payment to 15% of the condo's value, from the 5% they'd discussed earlier. Mr. Gray couldn't produce the cash, and the deal fell through. "It was heartbreaking," recalls Mr. Gray, a concierge at a clothing retailer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By December 2008, the average home price in Toronto was 9% below the year-earlier level, and sales volume was down 50%, the Toronto Real Estate Board reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Canada's housing slump didn't last long. In October 2008, the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> made the first of a series of rate cuts that eventually lowered the target for its key overnight lending rate to 0.25%, which in turn reduced banks' prime rate -- the basis for calculating variable-mortgage rates in Canada -- to 2.25% by April 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Canada, nearly all mortgages have rates that adjust at least every few years. Currently, rates on some loans have fallen to 2% or lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada never saw the wave of foreclosures that the U.S. did, and the balance sheets of Canadian banks stayed strong. As the global credit crunch began to ease at the end of 2008, Canada's big lenders, which handle the bulk of residential mortgages, started to market more aggressively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Toronto-Dominion Bank</span> boosted its mortgage sales force by 10%, says Tim Hockey, head of the Canadian banking operations. Don Peard, the <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Canada</span>'s mortgage chief for Alberta, told his sales people to double the number of calls they made seeking mortgage referrals from real-estate agents and home builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales started to rise again in February 2009. By midyear, Ms. Holmes, the Toronto real-estate agent, was seeing the kinds of bidding wars that were common in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's all the people that would have bought during the slowdown," she says. In September, she says, one condominium she handled had 15 offers -- her personal record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The low interest rates and the eagerness of banks to lend attracted buyers such as Cindy Girard of Red Deer, Alberta, who invests in residential real estate to supplement the money her husband earns as a welding inspector for the oil-and-gas industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Girard has been buying and renting out apartments for years. In 2009, she went into overdrive, buying six units in six months, with mortgages at rates ranging from 2.45% to 3.95%. She says she "maxed out" on the last mortgage, which pushed the family's ratio of debt service to income into the mid-40% range -- above the level many Canadian lenders are comfortable with.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Girard says she bought all the properties for below the asking prices. "Money is growing on trees these days, lending rates are so low," Ms. Girard wrote in December in an online forum for real-estate investors. "There are loads of properties to choose from, and the banks want to lend!"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, with housing prices rising, recent buyers are finding deals harder to come by. Ms. Holmes, the agent, explains that a few years ago monthly mortgage payments on downtown Toronto condos were far enough below rents that investors could count on making a profit. Now, she says, new investors are more commonly just breaking even.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bryce Wilson, an elementary-school teacher in Toronto who bought two condominiums in December, says a 20% drop in the value of his mutual funds prompted him to shift money into real estate. He's planning to rent out one property -- a one-bedroom apartment in a new condo building -- for C$1,500 a month, netting him C$360 a month after mortgage and maintenance fees. He says he is prepared for his 2% mortgage rate to rise. "I've budgeted for the rate doubling," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists at <span class="companylink">Toronto-Dominion Bank</span> say they think current home prices are about 12% above where they should be based on income and interest trends -- not enough for a bubble, they say, so long as future price increases are slowed by home building and rising mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hockey, <span class="companylink">Toronto-Dominion</span>'s domestic banking chief, says housing prices are "of interest but not a concern." If the situation worsens, he says, the bank will consider steps like raising the hurdles for borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government is mulling action too. Finance Minister Jim Flaherty has said that if it's warranted, he would consider tightening the terms for home buyers seeking government-insured loans, shortening maximum mortgage lengths from their current 35 years, or raising minimum down payments from the current 5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Canada's central bankers appear reluctant to take any steps that would hurt the economy. In a Jan. 11 speech, a representative of the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> said: "If the Bank were to raise interest rates to cool the housing market now . . . we would, in essence, be dousing the entire Canadian economy with cold water, just as it emerges from recession."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, the housing boom shows no sign of abating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gray, the Toronto concierge whose home deal fell through at the end of 2008, is looking again for a condo, although he's had to increase his budget to around C$350,000, from C$250,000. Ms. Girard, the housewife in Red Deer, says she hopes to buy a seventh unit in a few months -- after she pays down enough of her credit-card debt to qualify for another mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Carrasco, the Toronto massage therapist whose condo rose in value by 40% in one year, says he's glad he sold when he did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think we're in a housing bubble," he says. "I'm going to put stuff in storage, rent cheap and buy again when prices come down."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like millions of American households, the Mortgage Bankers Association found itself stuck with real estate whose market value has plunged far below the amount it owed its lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the trade group for mortgage lenders is refusing to provide the terms of a deal it made with creditors to escape from that predicament.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, <span class="companylink">CoStar Group Inc</span>., a provider of commercial real estate data, said it had agreed to buy the MBA's 10-story headquarters building in Washington, D.C., for $41.3 million. That is well below the $79 million the trade group agreed to pay for the glass-walled building in 2007, near the top of the property bubble, while it was still under construction. The price also falls short of the $75 million of financing that the MBA got from a group of banks led by <span class="companylink">PNC Financial Services Group Inc</span>. for the purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Courson, chief executive officer of the trade group, declined in an interview Saturday to say whether the MBA would pay off the full loan amount. "We're not going to discuss the financing," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two people familiar with the situation said they believed the MBA would pay off part of the approximately $30 million gap between the proceeds of the sale and the loan balance. A spokeswoman for the MBA added that the MBA has reached "an agreement with all relevant parties" on the loan but declined to provide details.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for PNC, a banking company based in Pittsburgh, declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The borrowing arrangement was complicated. Holliday Fenoglio Fowler LP, a real estate advisory firm, announced in June 2008 that it had arranged the $75 million financing. HFF said the loan took the form of variable-rate, 30-year bonds backed by a letter of credit from PNC. HFF said such bonds are typically sold to money market funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many homeowners who are "under water" on their houses, owing more than the current market value, have found that banks generally decline to reduce the loan balance, particularly when the borrowers have the financial ability to keep paying. In an interview late last year, Mr. Courson said he believed under-water mortgage borrowers should keep paying their loans even if that no longer seemed to be in their economic interest. He said paying off a mortgage isn't only a matter of personal interest. Defaults hurt neighborhoods by lowering property values, Mr. Courson said. "What about the message they will send to their family and their kids and their friends?" he asked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the MBA remains embroiled in a legal dispute over a $1 million payment due to its former Washington landlord, Tishman Speyer Properties. That payment is a penalty for the MBA's decision to end a lease early so it could move into the new building. The MBA spokeswoman said the trade group will make that payment and the dispute is over timing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the MBA is again seeking to rent office space in Washington. The spokeswoman said new space hasn't been found yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the MBA announced the purchase of the building in early 2007, the trade group's president at the time, Jonathan Kempner, said: "We have come to the inescapable conclusion that owning our own building was the smartest long-term investment for the association." In October 2009, however, the MBA informed its members that it had put the building up for sale. At that time, the MBA said that continued ownership of the building, which was financed with $75 million of variable-rate debt, would be "economically imprudent."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July 2008, Mr. Kempner announced his resignation. Though the MBA by then was having trouble finding tenants for unoccupied space in the building, Mr. Kempner said Sunday that the building purchase had "absolutely nothing" to do with his decision to depart, which he said was for "personal reasons."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The MBA spokeswoman said some members have said the trade group shouldn't be in the business of owning real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The MBA uses about 40% of the building's 169,000 square feet and tenants occupy about 10%, the spokeswoman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling membership and heavy debt costs related to the building have squeezed the MBA's finances in recent years. The MBA's membership totals about 2,400, down from a peak of 3,000 several years ago, but has increased recently, the spokeswoman said, and the organization expects to show a small surplus in its accounts for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30. The MBA's staff has dropped to 107 from a peak of more than 150, she said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-mortgage rates generally rose slightly this past week, with the average on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages edging back above 5%, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>'s weekly survey of mortgage loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates remained "relatively stable" for a second week amid "news of a strengthening housing market," said Freddie Chief Economist Frank Nothaft. Pending existing-home sales rebounded 1% in December from a record drop in November that was due, in part, to the original expiration of home-buyer tax credit, according to the National Association of Realtors. They have since been extended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"More recently mortgage applications for home purchases jumped 10% at the end of January, according to figures from the Mortgage Bankers Association," Mr. Nothaft added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But demand for new homes fell in December as cold weather and continued high unemployment chilled hopes for a housing market recovery, with single-family home sales dropping 7.6%, the Commerce Department said last week. December's drop followed a 9.3% plunge in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 5.01% for the week ended Thursday, up from the prior week's 4.98% average but down from 5.25% a year ago. Rates on 15-year fixed were 4.4%, compared with 4.39% and 4.92% respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five-year Treasury-indexed hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages averaged 4.27%, up from last week's 4.25% and down from 5.26% a year earlier. One-years fell to 4.22% from 4.29% and 4.92%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To obtain the rates, the fixed-rate mortgages required payment of an average 0.7 point, the five-year adjustable mortgage required a 0.6 point and the one-year had an average 0.5 point. A point is 1% of the mortgage amount, charged as prepaid interest.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sara Lin </div><div>865 words</div><div>5 February 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>W6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Goleta, Calif. -- In Spring 2003, while Gary Ross was in the Santa Ynez Valley shooting "Seabiscuit," a drama about a famed race horse during the Great Depression, he was simultaneously putting the finishing touches on a weekend home about 30 miles southeast through the San Marco Pass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As he consulted with the movie's set designer about how to design the house owned by Charles Howard, the ex-car salesman who owned Seabiscuit, Mr. Ross's fictitious and personal homes began influencing each other. "I definitely showed [the set designer] a picture of the [house] we used as a reference for our house," said the 53-year-old writer-director who has been nominated for an Oscar four times, including once for best picture for "Seabiscuit."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are similarities between the "Seabiscuit" home and Mr. Ross's. Both early California-style ranches, they have large porches and overhangs (Mr. Ross's is 1,000 square feet), shaded sitting areas outdoors and wooden porch swings. Inside, Mr. Ross's home features antique wood tables, studded leather chairs and a giant Navajo-style woven rug covering the floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Off a dirt road, Mr. Ross's home is in Goleta, a town just north of Santa Barbara that is itself a bit of a throwback. Still rural, the coastal community is made up of a patchwork of farms and cattle ranches. The Ross's house, a 3,500-square-foot ranch, sits on a 1.5-acre clearing atop a hill; the remaining 9.5 acres are covered by more than 750 tangerine and avocado trees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As he walked around the house, Mr. Ross, wearing jeans and work boots, ate a steady stream of seedless Satsuma mandarin tangerines stationed in bowls scattered around. Around Hollywood, the family is known for mandarins. Each holiday season they send out a box of fruit to 200 friends in the business -- and will honor requests for refills. Tobey Maguire (who played jockey Red Pollard in "Seabiscuit"), Sigourney Weaver and William H. Macy are always on the distribution list.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm still waiting for my oranges this year," noted Mr. Macy, who starred in Mr. Ross's "Pleasantville" and has fashioned bowls from avocado wood from the farm. He adds, "The stuff that Gary does is very high-pressure. . . . [the farm] is a godsend."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ross didn't originally set out to grow tangerines. A decade ago the family wanted some land to build a house on, but found they couldn't afford anything but a pint-sized parcel in Montecito or Santa Barbara. So they headed 20 minutes north to Goleta, where they purchased the 11-acre parcel for $700,000 and in 2003 spent another $1.5 million building the home. A nearby older home with an avocado orchard on half as much land as the Rosses' farm is on the market for $1.85 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taking his cue from other writers, Mr. Ross built himself a writing shack 25 yards from the house. The 120-square-foot rectangular room is simple, with windows on all sides, wooden plank floors, a desk, a computer and a faded button-backed brown leather sofa. While working on the animated feature "The Tale of Despereaux," Mr. Ross, who also co-wrote "Big," secluded himself in his studio for several days reviewing scenes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allison Thomas, Mr. Ross's wife and a film producer, decided to make the farm organic. The most enthusiastic farmer in the family -- she attributes her interest to reading "Walden" during high school -- she attended pruning seminars, read up on weeds and took classes on how to go organic, a process that took several years. The family hired a farm manager to look after the orchard when they're away, but do their own picking and maintenance whenever they visit. Ms. Thomas carries hand-drawn maps into the orchard to help her identify the different fruit trees she's planted and turns their produce into jams, jellies and apple sauce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent cloudless Sunday, the Rosses and their 14-year-old twins Jack and Claudia were eating bowls of Mr. Ross's pot-roast chili. While Mr. Ross headed out onto the lawn for a match of Frisbee golf with Jack, Claudia and a high-school friend huddled under a checkered wool blanket together on the porch swing outside, reading aloud their English-class homework. Later, their dog, a buttermilk-colored mutt named Champagne, dug for ground squirrels while Ms. Thomas donned her galoshes and headed down into the orchard, picking enough mandarins to fill five plastic crates that she set at the bottom of the hill. The food would be donated to the local food bank on their way back to Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Family members say that when they're at the farm they indulge in a lot of old-fashioned activities, like card games. Even their movie tastes are nostalgic. "We watch a lot of Chaplin up here," said Mr. Ross, adding that the family has "'Dr. Strangelove' on a constant loop."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Beverly Hills, Katzenberg</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pays $35 Million for Home</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Media mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg has paid $35 million for a house in Beverly Hills, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Katzenberg, who co-founded the DreamWorks studio, now serves as chief executive of DreamWorks Animation, which this year will release the fourth installment of its lucrative "Shrek" franchise. The six-acre property, which was never on the market, sits just above the Greystone Mansion, a Beverly Hills landmark. A long private drive leads to a house on a promontory. Mr. Katzenberg had been shopping for a large property with a view for several years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home belonged to aerospace pioneer Simon "Si" Ramo, who was instrumental in the development of the intercontinental ballistic missile and co-founded TRW, which was acquired by <span class="companylink">Northrop Grumman</span>. Mr. Katzenberg, who bought the property under the name of a trust, declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actress Sagal Lists Home</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actress Katey Sagal, a star of "Married With Children," and her husband, writer-actor Kurt Sutter, have listed their home in Los Angeles' Hollywood Hills for $4.98 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 1937 traditional country home of about 6,000 square feet, on almost an acre, has four bedrooms, eight baths and four fireplaces. There's a 1,500-square-foot guest house with a gym, an office and a studio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Sagal, Peggy Bundy in the 1990s sitcom "Children," appears in the television series "Sons of Anarchy" and voices a character in the animated series "Futurama." Mr. Sutter, best known for his work as a writer and actor on "The Shield," is the creator and executive producer of "Sons of Anarchy." The couple bought the home in 2005 and spent about $1 million renovating and installing the sport court. Heidi Lake of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span> Beverly Hills has the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wright-House Price Cut</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The owners of an iconic Los Angeles house designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and inspired by ancient Mayan architecture have cut its price to $10.5 million, 30% less than the $15 million asked last June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atop a promontory on a half-acre in the city's Los Feliz neighborhood, the 6,000-square-foot estate includes a three-bedroom main house, and separate chauffeur's quarters. The 1924 home, called the Ennis house, is one of four Mr. Wright constructed with interlocking pre-cast concrete blocks, some patterned and others smooth. The seller, the nonprofit Ennis House Foundation, is looking for a steward to buy and restore the house, which was damaged by the 1994 Northridge earthquake and torrential rains a decade later. Jeff Hyland shares the listing with Rick Hilton and Aaron Kirman of Christie's Great Estates affiliate Hilton &amp;Hyland and Mark Dilbeck and Ray Hayes of Dilbeck Realtors.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crude oil jumped to a nearly two-week high Tuesday as economic confidence was further buoyed by an unexpected increase in U.S. pending home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Light, sweet crude for March delivery settled $2.80, or 3.8%, higher at $77.23 a barrel on the <span class="companylink">New York Mercantile Exchange</span>. Brent crude on the ICE futures exchange closed $2.95, or 4%, higher at $76.07 a barrel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors index for pending sales of previously owned homes increased by 1% in December, surprising economists who had expected sales to remain flat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the data adding to stronger indicators that the economy is in recovery, oil prices climbed on the anticipation energy demand will start to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The bullish economic data of the last three trading days that began with U.S. [gross domestic product] growth Friday, strong manufacturing data [Monday] and [Tuesday's] home sales attracted buying interest in industrial commodities, such as gasoline," said Andy Lebow, senior vice president for energy with <span class="companylink">MF Global</span> in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added that the oil market is correcting some of the sharp losses experienced in recent weeks. Prices had dropped more than $10 a barrel since hitting a 15-month and intraday high of $83.95 a barrel Jan. 11.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What was pushing oil and other markets down were worries about the overall economy, but we have seen some good [economic] numbers in the past few days, especially the manufacturing data," said John Kilduff, partner of Round Earth Capital in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added that with crude getting "cheaper" there was buying interest again from managed and index-linked funds. Investors' appetite for riskier assets, such as oil and equities, has been rekindled by the economic optimism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Furthermore, weather forecasts for the Northeast are looking colder, with temperatures expected to be below normal for the next 10 days, which helped lift the heating-oil market, said Mr. Lebow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He noted refinery outages were bolstering the gasoline market after <span class="companylink">Valero Energy Corp</span>. said Tuesday it had shut a 66,000-barrel-a-day gasoline-making unit at its Jean Gaulin Refinery in Quebec following a fire early in the day. The U.S. is heading into its seasonal refinery-maintenance program, which can limit capacity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week's oil-inventory data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, due Wednesday, isn't expected to show any change in crude-oil stocks, according to analysts surveyed by Dow Jones. This is partly because of anticipated delays of imports into Texas last week after an oil spill caused the closure of the Sabine-Neches Waterway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gasoline stocks are expected to rise by one million barrels and distillate stocks, which include diesel and heating oil, to decline by 800,000 barrels. Refinery processing rates are seen unchanged at 78.5% of total capacity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil-demand figures will also be under scrutiny given the weak readings so far this year. "[The figures] will be somewhat influential this week if we see any kind of uptick in demand, especially gasoline," said Mr. Kilduff. It will show "how reactive consumers have been to a slight fall in prices at the pump".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Front-month March reformulated gasoline blendstock, or RBOB, settled 8.58 cents, or 4.4%, higher at $2.0179 a gallon. March heating oil settled 7.68 cents, or 3.9%, higher at $2.0317 a gallon.</p>

</div><div class="author">By ANTON TROIANOVSKI   </div><div>921 words</div><div>3 February 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For public real-estate companies, spending money has turned out to be harder than raising it—even as some signs point to a pickup in big property deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate investment trusts sold $24 billion in new stock last year, raising hopes the companies would be able to profit from commercial-property distress by picking up high-quality real estate at bargain prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But publicly traded REITs bought only $4.6 billion of property in 2009, a 67% decline from the previous year, according to research firm <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With few deals happening and REIT shares now trading at twice their March lows, some executives regret last year's money-raising binge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Today I'm sitting with $125 million in cash that I can't find investment for," Stephen Richter, chief financial officer of <span class="companylink">Weingarten Realty Investors</span>, said in an interview. "If I would have known the markets are where they are today, I certainly wouldn't have sold a third of the company."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weingarten, which owns shopping centers and warehouses in 23 states, sold about $380 million in stock last April, a time its shares were trading at less than half their value of a year before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs are having difficulty doing deals partly because there is a dearth of product on the market. With commercial-property prices some 35% off their peak, most building owners are keeping their best assets off the market. Those properties that do go on the block are attracting a herd of buyers looking to snap up cheap real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many REIT executives and investors expected the volume of distressed buildings on the market to surge as owners defaulted and lenders foreclosed on property. But while the number of problem loans has been growing, so far this hasn't translated into many fire sales. Banks have been willing to extend loans rather than foreclosing, and the firms that oversee commercial mortgages bundled into securities have also been slow to sell off distressed assets, market participants say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The volume of the properties that are truly distressed and will be sold in a distressed fashion will be significantly less than had initially been thought," said Bob Steers, the co-chief executive of REIT investor <span class="companylink">Cohen &amp; Steers Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scarcity of "for sale" signs has particularly roiled the market for "blind pool" REITs, which raise money from investors in order to build a new portfolio of real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, <span class="companylink">Terreno Realty Corp</span>., which sought $200 million from investors to snap up warehouses on the cheap, postponed its initial public offering. Research firm Green Street Advisors recommended clients not participate in the offering because the ability "to acquire properties at discounts to underlying fair current-market value is likely to be limited" for industrial real estate. Through a spokeswoman, Terreno Chief Executive Blake Baird declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another prospective blind pool sputtered in December when shareholders in a blank-check company balked at turning their cash over to a management team that would use it to buy strip malls. "People, I think, fundamentally were concerned that we wouldn't be able to generate the volume of acquisitions or investment opportunities to justify the investment in a blind pool," said Bill Gerrity, who would have headed up the REIT. Instead, the $288 million blank-check company, <span class="companylink">Global Brands Acquisition Corp</span>., said it would return its investors' money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best opportunities for REITs may lie in sales of large portfolios by private investors who can't access capital as readily as public companies. The bigger the portfolio and higher the price tag, the less the competition from other buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the biggest deal by a REIT since the downturn, mall landlord <span class="companylink">Simon Property Group Inc</span>. in December said it would buy Prime Outlets, another shopping center owner, for $700 million. The sale gave Prime's closely held parent, Lightstone Group LLC, cash to address the capital needs of its Extended Stay Hotels chain, which is now in bankruptcy protection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another big deal with a private owner, apartment giant <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> on Monday announced a $475 million deal for three Manhattan buildings owned by debt-burdened New York City developer Harry Macklowe. One analyst said <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> may have acquired the apartment buildings for half of what they would have gone for a few years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The advantage of access to capital will stay around for a while," said Ross Smotrich, a REIT analyst at <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span>'s other recent deals show bargain-basement prices for high-quality real estate are rare even today, amid the worst commercial-property downturn in a generation. Chief Executive David Neithercut said the company would soon announce the acquisitions of two apartment buildings in the Washington, D.C., area and one in California. He declined to reveal the price paid but said the deals came in at less-eye-popping discounts than the Macklowe buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reason: Many others—from foreign buyers to private investors with cash to spend—also want to get in on the action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October, <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> paid $100 million for a 326-unit apartment complex in Arlington, Va.. The property drew 160 interested parties and 40 offers, a level of interest that Alan Davis, a broker who represented the seller in the deal, said he couldn't recall in several years of shopping multifamily properties in the Washington area.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The percentage of Americans who owned their homes fell at the end of 2009 to the lowest point in nearly a decade, a reflection of continuing troubles in the housing market even as the sector showed signs of stabilizing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one upbeat sign, an index of pending sales of previously owned homes increased 1.0% to 96.6 in December, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday, suggesting the housing market is steadying after sharp swings caused by the uncertain fate of a government tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet home ownership is sliding. Some 67.3% of Americans owned their homes in the fourth quarter of last year, based on seasonally adjusted data, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. That is the lowest percentage since the second quarter of 2000, when the same share of Americans owned homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The home-ownership data I think really just underscores how this country as a whole became obsessed with getting people into homes," said Mike Larson, real-estate and interest-rate analyst at Weiss Research Inc., an investment-research firm. "You can do all kinds of things to get people into a house, which we did; the real problem is making it so they can stay there."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home-ownership rate reached a high of 69% in 2004 as low interest rates and easy credit prompted large numbers of families to stop renting and purchase homes. But the rate began to fall two years later as some homeowners struggled to make their mortgage payments and eventually lost their homes to foreclosure. Between 2007 to 2009, nearly four million homes were lost to foreclosure. And home ownership rates are now moving closer to the level that was common in the 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some economists had expected the home-ownership rate to stabilize or even rise slightly in the fourth quarter, because of the Obama administration's tax credit for first-time home buyers. The tax credit fueled a home-sales jump in September, October and November. But economists now believe that the number of foreclosures during the quarter overwhelmed rising home sales. "Had it not been for the tax credit, the home-ownership rate would have fallen even further," said Thomas Lawler, an independent housing economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline in home ownership reached all regions of the U.S. but was most pronounced in the South, where the level fell to 69.1% from 69.8% a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the pending home sales index in December was 10.9% higher than its level of 87.1 in December 2008. Pending sales of existing homes include single-family homes and condominiums. A home sale is pending when the contract has been signed but the transaction hasn't closed. Pending sales typically close within one or two months of signing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax credit helped sales last year, as did low prices and mortgage rates. The tax credit was due to run out Nov. 30 but was extended and expanded, through April 2010. But the market is still facing the problems of high unemployment and the difficulty many borrowers are having obtaining loans. While a Federal Reserve survey of senior loan officers Monday showed that banks had largely stopped tightening loan standards, residential mortgages were an exception. Some 17% of banks said they were making mortgage-approval standards tougher even for borrowers with high credit scores and well documented credit histories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By region, pending sales in the Northeast rose 2.3% in December and were 14.9% higher than a year earlier. The Midwest rose 5.2% in December and was 8.7% higher than a year earlier. The South climbed 2.2% in December and was 5.5% higher than December 2008. The West fell 3.8% in December but was 18.6% above a year earlier.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LAS VEGAS -- Home builders have lost half their share of the U.S. housing market in the past two years, largely because of competition from cheap foreclosed houses. In 2009 only 7.6% of the homes sold were newly constructed, down from the average of about 16% over the previous two decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But home builders are fighting back, cutting prices, promising to complete homes faster, and warning about the risks of buying foreclosed property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their efforts may be starting to pay off. On Tuesday, <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton Inc</span>., the second-largest U.S. builder, swung to a surprise quarterly profit, its first since the sector crashed, aided by improving business and a tax benefit. Donald R. Horton, the builder's chairman, said conditions remain challenging but he's optimistic as Horton focuses on low-priced housing as well as controlling its costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you want to be competitive with foreclosures, you've got to drive your prices down," says Steven Hilton, chief executive of <span class="companylink">Meritage Homes Corp</span>. In Maricopa, Ariz., a boom town near Phoenix hit hard by foreclosures. Meritage is offering three-bedroom houses for as little as $99,900, less than half the price of a typical new home there four years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meritage is generally holding prices below $250,000 now in Florida, Arizona and Texas, Mr. Hilton says, and they're below $325,000 in California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders can afford to lower their prices now in part because land is much cheaper. They're also able to squeeze their suppliers and subcontractors harder. Housing starts are running at less than a third of the 2005 level, making suppliers and subcontractors eager for orders and willing to work for less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of Meritage's big national rivals, <span class="companylink">KB Home</span>, is cutting costs partly by standardizing window sizes and floor plans rather than allowing endless local variations. "We build this same product line across the U.S. now," says Jim Widner, regional president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the homes that KB sells in Las Vegas now cost $150,000 to $170,000, he adds. During the housing boom, new-home prices were typically above $400,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders are also trying to complete homes faster for people who can't wait the typical four to six months required for a new home. A large share of today's buyers are first-timers who want to qualify for a federal tax credit that expires April 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meritage says it will guarantee to complete homes in 99 days in some markets. That's possible, Mr. Hilton says, partly because only efficient subcontractors have survived the bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Special deals are also helping builders. Lancaster, Pa.-based Charter Homes &amp;Neighborhoods offered 30-year mortgage rates in January that start at 2.87%, climb to 3.87% in year two, and then settle at 4.87%. In February, the starter rate increased to 2.99%, but it's still below current average mortgage rates of 5.10%. "People are definitely responding," says Rob Bowman, Charter's president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Las Vegas, <span class="companylink">Pardee Homes</span> is using email blasts to tell potential home buyers about possible hazards of buying foreclosed homes. Banks are sometimes slow to respond to would-be buyers' offers, they warn, and former owners have often neglected or even trashed the houses. "Unapparent damage may include leaking water, rot, asbestos or rodent infestations," a Pardee email says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some buyers are also starting to suffer from "foreclosure fatigue," says Klif Andrews, Pardee's Las Vegas division president, as it gets more difficult to compete with cash-rich investors for foreclosed houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, in some cases the lure of real or imagined bargains remains strong. Jim and Penny Seawards used to buy a new home each time they moved. But in their most recent search, concluded in December, they looked only at recent-vintage foreclosed houses. "We felt we could get more house for the money," says Mr. Seawards, the sales director at a Cadillac dealer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple bought a 3,600-square-foot house in Scottsdale, Ariz., for $425,000. They expect to spend $50,000 more on landscaping and other improvements, but their real estate agent, Jim Sexton of Russ Lyon <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>, figures a similar newly built house would have cost at least $625,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some home owners avoid new homes for other reasons. Lew Reich, an agent with <span class="companylink">Keller Williams Realty</span> in Plano, Texas, says buyers are sticking closer to downtown Dallas and the city's established suburbs, eschewing lengthy commutes. They also worry that some home builders won't stay in business long enough to finish construction or honor their warranties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists expect the foreclosure crisis to drag on for at least a few more years. So can home builders get back to their former pace of accounting for one of every six sales?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think we will get back there," says Bernard Markstein, an economist at the National Association of Home Builders, but, he says, it will take a few years. The NAHB forecasts that new home sales will jump 38% to 517,000 this year as the economy improves. But that would still be only about 9% of expected total home sales.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anton Troianovski </div><div>916 words</div><div>3 February 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For public real-estate companies, spending money has turned out to be harder than raising it -- even as some signs point to a pickup in big property deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate investment trusts sold $24 billion in new stock last year, raising hopes the companies would be able to profit from commercial-property distress by picking up high-quality real estate at bargain prices. But publicly traded REITs bought only $4.6 billion of property in 2009, a 67% decline from the previous year, according to research firm <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With few deals happening and REIT shares now trading at twice their March lows, some executives regret last year's money-raising binge. "Today I'm sitting with $125 million in cash that I can't find investment for," Stephen Richter, chief financial officer of <span class="companylink">Weingarten Realty Investors</span>, said in an interview. "If I would have known the markets are where they are today, I certainly wouldn't have sold a third of the company."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weingarten, which owns shopping centers and warehouses in 23 states, sold about $380 million in stock last April, a time its shares were trading at less than half their value of a year before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs are having difficulty doing deals partly because there is a dearth of product on the market. With commercial-property prices some 35% off their peak, most building owners are keeping their best assets off the market. Those properties that do go on the block are attracting a herd of buyers looking to snap up cheap real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many REIT executives and investors expected the volume of distressed buildings on the market to surge as owners defaulted and lenders foreclosed on property. But while the number of problem loans has been growing, so far this hasn't translated into many fire sales. Banks have been willing to extend loans rather than foreclosing, and the firms that oversee commercial mortgages bundled into securities also have been slow to sell distressed assets, market participants say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The volume of the properties that are truly distressed and will be sold in a distressed fashion will be significantly less than had initially been thought," said Bob Steers, the co-chief executive of REIT investor <span class="companylink">Cohen &amp;Steers Inc</span>. The scarcity of "for sale" signs has particularly roiled the market for "blind pool" REITs, which raise money from investors in order to build a new portfolio of real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, <span class="companylink">Terreno Realty Corp</span>., which sought $200 million from investors to snap up warehouses on the cheap, postponed its initial public offering. Research firm Green Street Advisors recommended clients not participate in the offering because the ability "to acquire properties at discounts to underlying fair current-market value is likely to be limited" for industrial real estate. Through a spokeswoman, Terreno Chief Executive Blake Baird declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another prospective blind pool sputtered when shareholders in a blank-check company balked at turning cash over to a management team that would use it to buy strip malls. "People, I think, fundamentally were concerned that we wouldn't be able to generate the volume of acquisitions or investment opportunities to justify the investment in a blind pool," said Bill Gerrity, who would have run the REIT. Instead, the $288 million blank-check company, <span class="companylink">Global Brands Acquisition Corp</span>., said it would return investors' money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best opportunities for REITs may lie in sales of large portfolios by private investors who can't access capital as readily as public companies. The bigger the portfolio and higher the price tag, the less the competition from other buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the biggest deal by a REIT since the downturn, mall landlord <span class="companylink">Simon Property Group Inc</span>. in December said it would buy Prime Outlets, another shopping center owner, for $700 million. The sale gave Prime's closely held parent, Lightstone Group LLC, cash to address the capital needs of its Extended Stay Hotels chain, which is now in bankruptcy protection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another big deal with a private owner, apartment giant <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> on Monday announced a $475 million deal for three Manhattan buildings owned by debt-burdened New York City developer Harry Macklowe. One analyst said <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> may have acquired the apartment buildings for half of what they would have gone for a few years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The advantage of access to capital will stay around for a while," said Ross Smotrich, a REIT analyst at <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span>'s other recent deals show bargain-basement prices for high-quality real estate are rare even today, amid the worst commercial-property downturn in a generation. Chief Executive David Neithercut said the company would soon announce the acquisitions of two apartment buildings in the Washington area and one in California. He declined to disclose the price paid but said the deals came in at less-eye-popping discounts than the Macklowe buildings. The reason: Many others -- from foreign buyers to private investors with cash to spend -- also want to get in on the action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October, <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> paid $100 million for a 326-unit apartment complex in Arlington, Va. The property drew 160 interested parties and 40 offers, a level of interest that Alan Davis, a broker who represented the seller in the deal, said he couldn't recall in several years of shopping multifamily properties in the Washington area.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending on new construction was sharply lower in 2009. Total value of construction spending was running at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $902.5 billion in December, down 1.2% from November and off 9.9% compared with December a year earlier. The largest year-over-year decline was in hotels, where construction spending was off 46.1%. Office construction was down 26.2%, and residential construction was down 10.3%. One of the few bright spots: Construction spending on power plants was up 13.5% year over year. The value of nonresidential construction spending declined 9.8% in December when compared with a year earlier.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Cari Tuna   </div><div>895 words</div><div>2 February 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California's economy is showing signs of stabilizing, but progress is uneven as coastal regions begin to rally and inland areas continue to sink.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unemployment rates are dipping and home prices are rebounding in the San Francisco Bay area, which is driven by its technology industry and exports, and in coastal Southern California, where entertainment and other industries are starting to benefit from the economic thaw. But in the state's Central Valley and Inland Empire regions, where the downturn struck earlier and harder, unemployment rates are still rising and the battered construction industry keeps shedding workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"California has become increasingly divided between coastal and inland areas," said Hans Johnson, associate director at the Public Policy Institute of California, a San Francisco think tank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While California's economy has long had different pockets of economic activity,The continuing decline inland could drag down the state's overall recovery and lead to greater inequality between residents. That has national repercussions, since the state's $1.8 trillion economy is often viewed as an economic bellwether.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, California's economy remains weak, and the stabilization on the coast is just beginning. The state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 12.4% in December, down from an October peak of 12.5% but still higher than the national unemployment rate of 10%, according to the California Employment Development Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The different economic trajectories of the state's coastal and inland areas are evident in the experiences of <span class="companylink">Marvell Technology Group Ltd</span>. and Pelco Inc. Marvell, a Silicon Valley microchip maker, currently lists on its Web site about 120 job openings at its operational headquarters in Santa Clara, though some of those spots might be filled internally, said Marvell corporate-marketing executive Tom Hayes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The job openings follow a sales drop in early 2009, when Marvell cut around 130 jobs in Santa Clara. Since then, revenue has picked up due to rising exports to countries such as China, among other factors, Mr. Hayes said. Marvell has about 5,000 employees world-wide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, <span class="companylink">Schneider Electric SA</span>'s Pelco unit laid off 100 of its roughly 2,200 employees last month amid weak demand. The maker of video and security equipment, located well inland in the Fresno County city of Clovis, said it didn't expect sales to quickly recover. "It was just absolutely necessary to realign the size of our company to match the current economy," spokeswoman Kathleen Rhodes said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inland-coastal split is likely to have significant demographic and social consequences. Mr. Johnson said that during the housing boom, many coastal residents moved inland to buy homes, despite longer commutes to jobs in the Bay area or greater Los Angeles. In recent years, that migration trend reversed, he said, as foreclosures mounted inland and housing prices fell on the coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, housing prices in coastal areas again are rising, a sign that their economies are reviving. The median home price in the nine-county Bay area increased 15.2% in December from a year earlier to $380,000, according to data provider MDA <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>. In coastal Southern California, the median home price increased 7.5% to $360,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, the median home price in the eight-county Central Valley fell 11.3% to $142,000 over the same period, according to <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>. In the Inland Empire counties of San Bernardino and Riverside, the median home price in December was $180,000, down 10% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local jobless rates, which aren't seasonally adjusted, show a similar pattern. Unemployment rates fell in December from November in eight of the Bay area's nine counties and three of coastal Southern California's four counties, according to the state Employment Development Department. But in the Central Valley, where unemployment already is higher, jobless rates rose in six of eight counties and held steady in the other two. In a rare glimmer of positive news, San Bernardino and Riverside saw their unemployment rates fall in December, though joblessness there remained high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen Levy, director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy, a Palo Alto think tank, said coastal Northern and Southern California are benefiting from a nascent revival in venture-capital investment and exports. In the fourth quarter, venture capitalists invested $2.8 billion in California, according to research firm VentureSource. The Bay area received 76% of that investment and coastal Southern California took in 19%. Just 5% went to other parts of the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The convergence of economic fortunes of coastal Northern and Southern California marks a departure from the past two recessions. In the early 1990s, Southern California hemorrhaged jobs in aerospace and defense following the Cold War's end,and it trailed the Bay area's red-hot economy for the rest of the decade. Southern California weathered the dot-com bust in the early 2000s better than the tech-dependent Bay area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But recent years saw the rise of a new center of economic activity in inland California, driven primarily by construction. That growth engine is now gone, Mr. Levy said. Inland regions "aren't going to be able to pull themselves by their own bootstraps," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In two fresh indications of a strengthening U.S. economy, a new survey showed that banks have stopped making it tougher for consumers and businesses to borrow, and manufacturing activity climbed to its highest levels in five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday's manufacturing report, from the Institute for Supply Management, cheered the stock market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 118.20 points, or 1.17%, to 10185.53.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks in the U.S. haven't entirely turned the corner: While they're not making it tougher to borrow, they're generally not making it any easier, either, according to a Federal Reserve survey released Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of more than 50 banks surveyed, none said it had tightened business-lending standards for medium or big firms, and only two said they had tightened for smaller firms. By contrast, in the October survey, eight banks tightened business lending to medium or large firms and nine banks tightened them for small firms. Lenders spent much of the past two years ratcheting back on credit amid the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM on Monday said an index compiled from its survey of purchasing managers rose to 58.4 last month from 54.9 in December, the sixth straight month of increase. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With manufacturing activity at its highest point since August 2004 and continued month-to-month gains, the sector's recovery appears more sustainable than many economists predicted just a few months ago. That bodes well for the overall economy. Nomura Global Economics said it would likely revise its first-quarter gross domestic product forecast up to 3% or 3.5%, from 2.6%, following the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It remains to be seen whether this growth will be sustained once manufacturers have restocked inventories, a key source of the current strength.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Things are certainly picking up in the manufacturing sector," said Norbert J. Ore, chairman of the survey committee, noting that 13 out of 18 industries experienced growth. "That's what I was looking for . . . a little more breadth to the recovery to indicate it was spreading."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM's index for new orders expanded at a faster rate last month, while the inventory index showed businesses were reducing stocks at a slower pace. The survey also found tentative signs that manufacturers are at least beginning to think about hiring again. The employment index hit 53.3, up from 50.2 in December. But Mr. Ore said, "I think it's premature to think there would be much in the way of job growth coming out of manufacturing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even amid the upbeat reports, many manufacturers remain cautious about the outlook. They worry that consumers, fearful of job losses and facing turmoil in the housing market, will be hesitant to spend more money in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William Bachman, a small manufacturer who sits on the board of St. Louis-based Bremen Bank &amp;Trust, says that bank sharply tightened its lending standards early in the recession and, thus far, has made no moves to loosen lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have money we can loan," he says. "It's finding credit-worthy borrowers that's the hard part." He says Bremen, a $235 million community bank that focuses on lending to local businesses, is finding that many customers are paying down debt, not seeking new loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Todd Teske, CEO of <span class="companylink">Briggs &amp;Stratton Corp</span>., sees consumers coming back into the market for his company's lawn mowers and other yard equipment. "Consumers have deferred purchases of lawn mowers, so we know they'll have to spend this year," he says. "But they will mix down: If they buy a walk-behind mower, they'll gravitate toward a $200 mower, not a $400 mower."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies also worry that difficulties borrowing, particularly for smaller companies, could hamper the recovery. None of the banks surveyed by the Fed said they had made standards stricter for approving commercial and industrial loans to medium and large firms. But 3.7% of banks said they tightened those standards for small businesses. Some 10.8% of banks also said they had decreased existing lines of credit for business credit-card accounts. No banks said they had increased them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even when credit is accessible, businesses and households are hesitant to tap into it. "For the first time in nearly three years, a small net fraction of banks reported an increased willingness to make consumer installment loans now as opposed to three months ago," the Fed report said. "However, demand for consumer loans of all types reportedly had weakened further since the previous survey."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just one out of 52 banks said it was less willing, as of mid-January, to make a consumer loan now as opposed to three months earlier. Six said they were more willing to lend. Meanwhile, 21 out of 51 banks said demand for such loans was weaker, compared with four that said it was stronger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That may be because consumers are saving more instead of spending more, which is one of the threats to the economy's rebound. Personal income rose 0.4% in December from a month earlier, before adjusting for inflation, the Commerce Department said Monday. Consumer spending rose just 0.2% in December. The personal-savings rate climbed to 4.8%, up from 4.5% in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Greig, CEO of FirstMerit Bank NA, a $10.5 billion bank in Akron, Ohio, says his bank has been making loans to credit-worthy customers throughout the downturn. "What we've experienced is an ongoing reduction in the utilization of committed credit facilities," he says, noting that as of the end of December, his client's total use of available credit facilities stood at 42% -- down from the "mid-50s" a year ago. "The comments I'm picking up from customers is that there's a lack of confidence in the economic recovery and they're going to defer further investment in their businesses until they see a more positive move in economic trends," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, construction spending fell 1.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $902.5 billion in December, the Commerce Department said Monday, reflecting the overall weakness in the industry as last year came to a close. A total of $939.1 billion was spent on construction last year, 12.4% lower than the total spent in 2008.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. factory sector booked its best performance in more than five years in January, amid a rebound in hiring and rising price pressures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a key report, the private research group Institute for Supply Management said Monday its index of manufacturing activity moved to 58.4 in January from 54.9 in December. It was the best reading since August 2004. Readings of more than 50 indicate growth and describe the breadth, but not magnitude, of the change. Economists had expected the index to come in at 55.3.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, consumer spending was tepid in December despite rising income levels, the U.S. Commerce Department reported, suggesting consumers remained cautious at year-end. Meanwhile, construction spending tumbled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This month's report provides significant assurance that the manufacturing sector is in recovery," said Norbert Ore, who directs the ISM survey. He added that "13 of 18 industries reported growth, up from nine industries last month, and this is a good indication that the impact of the recovery is expanding."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the report's details were positive, and supportive of the idea the manufacturing sector is continuing to recover and provide a foundation for a broader economic rebound. In the report, the group said its new-orders index hit 65.9, from December's 64.8, while the production index was 66.2, from 59.7.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employment continued its wobbly move toward job gains, with that index at 53.3, versus 50.2 the prior month. January was the second straight month of growth and the best performance for that reading since April 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories shrank less slowly, with that index standing at 46.5, from 43.0. Falling inventory levels have been a major driver in spurring production as demand from consumers and businesses mends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, inflationary pressures faced by factory operators grew, with the prices index at 70.0, from 61.5.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personal income rose 0.4% in December, while personal spending rose 0.2%, the Commerce Department said. The income rise was more than expected, while spending advanced less than economists had anticipated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A key price gauge closely watched by the U.S. Federal Reserve showed prices rose 1.5% in December compared with December 2008. The core price index for personal consumption expenditures, which excludes volatile food and energy, was up 0.1% in December compared with November. Fed policy makers watch the core PCE index closely for signs of inflation pressures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The PCE price index including food and energy prices was up 0.1% in December compared with November and climbed 2.1% year over year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast consumer spending and consumer income each would rise by 0.3% in December. The monthly core PCE was seen rising by 0.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction spending declined 1.2%, at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $902.55 billion compared with the prior month, the Commerce Department said. It was the fifth decrease in six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all of 2009, spending fell 12.4% from 2008. That was the largest drop since records began in 1964. Construction spending fell in December more than expected, reflecting commercial real-estate weakness and uncertainty over a government subsidy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential construction-project spending last month dropped 2.7% to $268.7 billion. Commercial construction fell 0.5%. Spending fell for hotels, roads and factories. In all of 2009, commercial construction was down 11.2% from 2008.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally there are some signs of an end to the drubbing taken by commercial real-estate valuations. But that doesn't make it time for investors to go shopping for real-estate investment trusts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if—and it remains an if—the price of underlying property held by REITs stabilizes in price, equity values could still be hit by higher interest rates and the increasing correlation of real-estate stocks with the broader market. From a cash-flow perspective, REITs still face declining rents and occupancy levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps most important, REITs have already soared from their lows. The Dow Jones Equity All REIT index, which lost three-quarters of its value between February 2007 and March 2009, has doubled since last spring. REITs now trade at a roughly 20% premium to the net value of their real estate, research firm Green Street Advisors estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To bulls, that premium is deserved given hopes that commercial-property values will rise as the economy recovers. Feeding that optimism: Publicly traded REITs, unlike many private rivals, have raised debt and equity to strengthen their balance sheets, giving them the cash to buy distressed properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, from a stock-market perspective, the nature of REIT investing could have changed. In years past, investors bought REITs hoping their relatively stable rental income from office buildings and shopping centers would shield them from stock-market volatility. Instead, at least recently, real-estate stocks have largely tracked the broader market. Many expect that to continue. Any ongoing correction in the broader market would likely take its toll on REITs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rise in interest rates also could be painful. Rock-bottom yields on cash, as the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates, helped push investors into dividend-paying REITs, where they could get a better return. That would look less attractive if returns from cash and bonds drift higher again. Meanwhile, building owners who were able to cover interest payments because of falling interest rates will find life tougher as rents remain weak and floating rate debt gets more expensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big opportunity of REITs using their strengthened balance sheets to scoop up bargains also might not materialize. With banks readily extending loans, distressed owners are hanging on rather than selling at the prices bargain hunters want. And some wealthy investors such as sovereign funds hope to buy skyscrapers and shopping malls on the cheap, increasing demand for the few properties that come to market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, there is still little firm evidence that prices have actually bottomed. Because office lease terms often last five years or more, rental agreements signed during the frothy market are just starting to roll over—and tenants are sure to demand lower rents and other concessions. One research firm, CBRE Econometric Advisors, says commercial property values have only fallen by about two thirds of the expected peak-to-trough correction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors drawn to the pockets of good news in commercial real estate should realize that REIT prices, probably, already reflect it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for new homes in December fell, as cold weather and continuing joblessness put a chill on hopes for a housing-market recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family home sales fell 7.6% from November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 342,000, the Commerce Department said Wednesday, though it noted the drop was within the margin of error. December's reported drop followed a 9.3% plunge in November. Meanwhile, on a positive note, home inventories fell last year, compared with 2008, but prices fell, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The new-home market continued to wilt late in 2009," Mike Larson, an analyst at Weiss Research Inc., wrote clients. "The buyers who are willing and able to buy are flocking to cheaper, distressed, 'used' homes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales for all of 2009 dropped sharply, by 22.9% to an unadjusted 374,000, from 2008's 485,000, as the industry struggled after collapsing from its multiyear boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales suffered because of strong demand for used homes and the looming expiration of a big tax credit. Fears that the $8,000 government incentive for first-time buyers would run out Nov. 30 pushed purchases into earlier months. Congress in early November extended the relief through April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Overall, the housing-market recovery remains fragile," <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span>'s Anna Piretti wrote to clients. "Tight credit conditions, ongoing deleveraging, a likely increase in mortgage rates and a 10% unemployment rate all point to sluggish housing demand after the tax-credit program expires."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts believe a sustainable housing-market recovery in the spring will depend on improvements in the labor market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax credit was an early Obama administration tool to revive the moribund housing sector and to help jump-start an economy deep in recession. In recent months, it has caused swings in sales. Data Monday showed existing-home sales plunged in December after three straight increases, fueled by buyers taking advantage of the $8,000 subsidy and dirt-cheap prices on foreclosed homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weather is also a wild card for the housing market. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said December was three degrees below normal. And it was the 11th-wettest December on record. The weather drove buyers to the sidelines, and reduced construction, leading to a drop in housing starts. Permits for future construction, though, jumped, indicating builders haven't lost heart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders have been buoyed by shrinking inventories. There were an estimated 231,000 homes for sale at the end of December, down from 235,000 in November. But the months' supply at the current sales rate rose because sales fell sharply, to 8.1 from 7.6 in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While bad weather, difficulty getting loans and the job market scared off some buyers last month, low prices and interest rates enticed others. The median price for a new home fell 3.6% in December to $221,300 from $229,600 in December 2008.</p>
