<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> posted a $2.1 billion loss for the second quarter, down from a year-ago loss of $4.7 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mortgage-finance giant paid $1.6 billion to the government and asked for $1.5 billion in new aid during the quarter. That marked the fourth consecutive period in which, after making its regular dividend payment to the government, the company didn't generate a loss for U.S. taxpayers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report came on the same day that <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> downgraded the long-term credit rating of <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and its larger cousin, <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, to AA-plus from AAA. That stemmed from S&amp;P's decision late Friday to cut the credit rating of the U.S. government, which effectively nationalized Fannie and Freddie three years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. government has pledged to keep Fannie and Freddie afloat by injecting unlimited amounts of money into both in order to keep mortgage markets functioning. Fannie and Freddie are required to pay a 10% dividend to the government on those infusions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past year, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> has absorbed $2.1 billion in government aid to cover, in part, the cost of $6.4 billion in payments to the Treasury. The cost of the government's bailout of Freddie stands at $51.9 billion. <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> last week reported a net loss of $2.9 billion for the second quarter and asked the government for another $2.8 billion on Friday, bringing its tab to $89 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Freddie's quarterly loss stemmed in part from losses on derivatives that are used to hedge the firm's exposure to swings in interest rates. The firm also added $2.5 billion to its loss reserves, up from a $2 billion addition in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While mortgage rates have fallen to new lows in the past two weeks, Chief Executive Charles "Ed" Haldeman Jr. warned that "labor market weakness and households' worries about their financial security" had damped home sales, prompting a "cautious" outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While both companies ran up huge losses in the two years following the government takeover, Freddie has shown glimmers of stability in recent quarters. That stems in part from the size of its loan book, which is about 40% smaller than Fannie's, and because Freddie guaranteed fewer risky loans than Fannie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of June, about 3.5% of mortgages guaranteed by <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> were 90 days or more past due, compared with 4.08% at <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>. Fannie has about $200 billion in nonperforming home loans, compared with roughly $115 billion at Freddie.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New construction permits in New York are on the rise, a sign that the city's ailing construction industry may be picking up steam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction permits for new buildings, alterations and demolition rose by about 12% during the first half of 2011 compared with the same period last year, according to new data from the city Department of Buildings. Demolitions -- generally an indicator that developers are starting projects -- jumped 14%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Large-scale projects have been hard to come by in post-financial crisis New York. The boost in new permits is an encouraging sign for the industry, but the numbers don't indicate whether these are large or small construction jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while the number of construction permits is an improvement from 2010 and 2009, they are still about 6% below the figures of the first half of 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"More construction permits mean more people are going to work," said Buildings Commissioner Robert LiMandri.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York's construction industry has been plagued by high unemployment since the downturn began. During the first quarter of this year, there were 101,200 people employed by the industry, according to New York Building Congress, a trade association. That's the lowest level since 1998.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think it's getting worse for us," said Jack Kittle, political director for DC 9 International Union of Painters and Allied Trades. Good construction workers who are usually in high demand typically don't show up to union halls unless they are out of work, he said. "That's when you know things are bad. I see a lot of them right now," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private developers are still having a tough time convincing lenders to finance big projects, said Richard T. Anderson, president of the New York Building Congress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has made the construction industry more reliant on public institutions such as the New York City School Construction Authority and the City University of New York for work, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in construction permits is "certainly a positive sign," but the improvement has been undercut by the number of stalled sites in the city, Mr. Anderson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are about 650 stalled sites across the five boroughs, according to the Department of Buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They have been at a stubbornly high level," Mr. Anderson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some projects have come back to life in recent months. Extell Development Co.'s 34-story International Gem Tower in the Diamond District started work recently after months of inactivity, said John Livingston, president of Tishman Construction Corp., which is building the tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More projects are on the way, he said. Tishman has begun preconstruction at the Donnell Library on West 53rd Street, where <span class="companylink">Starwood Capital Group</span> and Tribeca Associates plan to build a $400 million hotel and condo tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We got a lot in the queue," Mr. Livingston said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2009 and 2010, there was a lot of pessimism among developers, but that has begun to shift, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is a renewed confidence. We are cautiously optimistic about the future," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Lambeck, head of the construction management program at New York University's Schack Institute of Real Estate, said the increase in permits is encouraging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, he added, a bounce-back is far from certain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent debt showdown in Washington, D.C., and plunging financial markets may give already-jittery lenders further cause for caution, Mr. Lambeck said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of these [larger] projects are waiting for the economy to turn around," he said. "I think they are going to wait a little longer."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">François Ortalo-Magné takes the helm of the Wisconsin School of Business next month following Wisconsin's contentious battle over collective bargaining rights for public-employee unions, which has presented challenges for the state university system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ortalo-Magné, however, sees those challenges as opportunities. The business school suffered some loss of funding—a small fraction of the nearly $100 million cut made to parent school University of Wisconsin-Madison. In exchange, the university system wrested some control over hiring and budgets from the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Challenges are nothing new for Mr. Ortalo-Magné, who became chair of the school's Real Estate and Urban Land Economics department in 2008 in the wake of the housing crisis. He helped navigate the program through the disappearance of development-sector jobs and the rise of the foreclosure industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also helped launch the school's Global Real Estate Master program, teaming up with schools in Hong Kong, Costa Rica and his native France. Now on a larger stage, he is looking to continue expanding Wisconsin's international reach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ortalo-Magné spoke with The Wall Street Journal about changes in the real-estate job market, the state's budget crisis and his push to globalize the business school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edited excerpts:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: Your expertise is in real estate, a tumultuous industry. Why would someone study it these days?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ortalo-Magné: We are getting students who want to move to leadership positions in that industry. These are people involved on all sides, from developers, people interested in land use, all the way to people investing in the product—equity and debt—and then people investing in investments. REITs [real-estate investment trusts], for example, [and] CMBSs [commercial mortgage backed securities].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: What's changed [post-crisis] in terms of who you're getting and where they're going?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ortalo-Magné: Who we are getting [hasn't changed much]. The industry is obviously a little more discriminating in terms of who they hire. Development has slowed down a lot. The whole CMBS industry was [hiring] students during the boom years, and there's much less activity on that side of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now there are people working on foreclosures; that was not that big during the boom years. In '07 we started [offering] more advanced topics in real-estate law to prepare our students for these types of issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: Bigger picture, there's a lot of uncertainty [in the job market]. How can you prepare your students for that?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ortalo-Magné: The best thing we can do for our students is help them understand how we frame questions. As a business school within a research university, we have a mandate to not just teach what's in the textbook, but to teach students how to think about observations. If you can equip them with that, they'll be equipped for whatever they face.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: How much do the financial problems of the state affect you?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ortalo-Magné: At this point, the budgetary situation at the state level has not affected our strategy. If anything, it's actually opened new doors for us. As part of the conversation about our budget, we've had conversations about getting more flexibility from state regulations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's about aligning faculty to focus on what they are best at by complementing them with the optimal type of skill mix. [That] doesn't match what the state structure was forcing us to follow. A very simple example: Providing faculty with someone who can type really fast is no longer as useful as it used to be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: You were central to building the school's international partnerships. What's the next step?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ortalo-Magné: We want to reinvent—or to invent our kind of—partnership. I do not see right now putting up a campus on another continent. However, we are in conversations with other business schools in how can we provide expertise to serve the needs that they see on other continents in exactly the same way that we are doing right now in real estate. I think there is room for innovating in how we think about outsourcing in the business of education.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: What are the cons of outsourcing some of the education?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ortalo-Magné: The way we handle this is by aligning ourselves in the choice of partners. You have to align values, nothing replaces that. Those partnerships which we have put in place so far, they have built upon friendships between faculty across institutions.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 25-year-old real-estate investment trust, which has sparked some criticism for its strong appetite for acquisitions, has agreed to buy New Orleans's tallest skyscraper for $107 million, according to people familiar with the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">CommonWealth REIT</span>, of Newton, Mass., is buying the 51-story office building named One Shell Square from <span class="companylink">MetLife Inc</span>., the people said. CommonWealth and <span class="companylink">MetLife</span> declined to comment on the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal reflects the pressure many buyers are facing to push into new territories for buildings as competition has made major market bargains scarcer. "Things have been getting a little more challenging," John Popeo, CommonWealth's chief financial officer, told an investors' conference in June, according to a transcript.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CommonWealth's buying spree—and its decision to finance it, in part, by selling new shares—also has attracted new scrutiny to the REIT. CommonWealth has spent more than $2 billion scooping up dozens of office buildings through the downturn, making it one of the biggest buyers of U.S. office properties in this cycle, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>. Among its other deals: Earlier this year it paid $171 million for <span class="companylink">Office Depot Inc</span>.'s Boca Raton, Fla., headquarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early in the recovery the company's buying binge was cheered by some analysts, but rising prices and concerns about tenants signing new leases at lower rents has raised some red flags. Stephen Swett, an analyst with Morgan Keegan, questions the company's move last month to issue about 11.5 million new common shares for $24, a discount to the $30 share value that Mr. Swett estimates the company's underlying portfolio is worth. "You're essentially selling your own real estate at a cheap price to buy [buildings] at a market price," Mr. Swett says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tim Bonang, a CommonWealth spokesman, said issuing shares dilutes the stock's value in the short term, but that the company should benefit because the money allows it to turn its portfolio away from suburban buildings to office properties in central business districts where tenant demand is expected to be stronger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CommonWealth is no stranger to criticism as a so-called externally managed REIT. In most REITs, the managers work for the same company that owns the properties. But, with externally managed REITs, the property is managed by separate companies. Sometimes, according to critics, the interests of the managers conflict with the interests of the REITs' shareholders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In CommonWealth's case, the company's day-to-day operations are managed by <span class="companylink">Reit Management &amp; Research LLC</span>, owned by Barry Portnoy and his son Adam Portnoy. Both are on CommonWealth's board of trustees, and Adam Portnoy is president of both CommonWealth and Reit Management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts are concerned the prospect of increased business could spur Reit Management to buy properties even when they aren't a good fit for CommonWealth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Green Street Advisors, a Newport Beach, Calif. research firm, doesn't follow externally managed real-estate firms because of such conflicts. "The fees get bigger as the company gets bigger, but not necessarily as the company gets better," says Michael Knott, a managing director at Green Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CommonWealth has underperformed the FTSE NAREIT All Equity REITs Index , a broad group of REIT stocks. CommonWealth's total annualized one-year return as of July 27 was 1.3% compared with 22.82% for the index, and the company's 15-year annualized return was 3.4% compared with 10.8% for the index, according to Green Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Bonang points out that investors who have held stock since the company's inception in 1986 have gotten an 8.5% average annual return. He also notes that the REIT has sold more than $1 billion in assets since the beginning of 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a February earnings conference call, Adam Portnoy said the company has been prudent in its growth. "…Many of the peers that have an internally managed structure have engaged in far more aggressive growth tactics than we have ever used," Mr. Portnoy said, according to a transcript.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the New Orleans deal, CommonWealth is paying about $89 a square foot. At the peak of the market, some New Orleans property sold in as high as $200 a square foot, according to Real Capital. Evan Stone of <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> represented <span class="companylink">MetLife</span> in the current sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, for its lower price, CommonWealth is taking on some market risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The occupancy of the building has fallen to about 88%. One Shell Square is named after <span class="companylink">Shell Oil Co</span>., the U.S. arm of <span class="companylink">Royal Dutch Shell PLC</span>, and roughly half the building is occupied by Royal Dutch employees. But that lease expires in 2016, according to people familiar with the property. When One Shell was built by Texas developer Gerald Hines in the 1970s, New Orleans could rely pretty confidently in the energy industry. But that has changed in recent years as companies have relocated workers to Houston and the suburbs, leaving landlords looking to technology companies and other industries to fill the holes.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Conor Dougherty   </div><div>522 words</div><div>2 August 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. manufacturing sector barely expanded in July, a sign that a onetime driver of the economy is waning along with the recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new reports echoes earlier ones, which show that after a long cycle of rebuilding inventories, factories in the U.S. and overseas are curtailing production amid softer demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index -- a survey of purchasing managers that gauges business activity at factories and other industrial plants -- was at 50.9% in July, down from 55.3% in June. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion, so the July level -- the lowest since July 2009, the first month of the recovery -- portrays a sector inching into the second half of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's definitely not a good start," said Brad Holcomb, chairman of the ISM manufacturing report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report's details contained more troubling news: All the index's components, from production to supplier deliveries and employment, fell over the month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A particular concern was the new-orders index, a gauge of future activity, which fell to 49.2, meaning the level of new orders contracted for the first time since June 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We shouldn't be at a point in the recovery where you're getting a big pullback in the pipeline of activity," said David Greenlaw, an economist with <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>. He added that the report raised questions about many economists' forecasts -- including his own -- that growth would pick up in the second half.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only spots of good news were that exports increased, if slightly, and the ISM's price index fell to 59 from 68 -- an indication that energy and raw-material costs are easing, giving manufacturers some relief on squeezed profit margins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the weakness can be explained by uncertainty over the debt-ceiling debate, which some manufacturers said was a factor, according to the ISM report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, supply disruptions stemming from the March earthquake in Japan are still playing out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the manufacturing slowdown isn't limited to the U.S. A global purchasing-managers index assembled by economists at <span class="companylink">J.P.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Japan was growing briskly as its factories snap back from a retrenchment following the quake, manufacturers in both developed and emerging economies were seeing production slow, said Joseph Lupton, an economist at <span class="companylink">J.P.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report Monday from the Commerce Department showed construction spending rose 0.2% in June, the third-consecutive monthly gain, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $772.3 billion. The previous month's gain was revised up. Despite the improvement, construction spending remains stuck at recession-era levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday's report showed a monthly gain in private spending outpaced a decline in spending on government projects, which have become a drag as state and local governments cut back to close budget gaps.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roughly 300 miles off the coast of South Florida is a string of mostly uninhabited small islands amid clear blue water and coral reefs on a limestone plateau. There's virtually no nightlife, no major airports, no celebrity chef restaurants. There are also no neighbors. That remoteness is attracting a rarefied group of wealthy entertainers and name-brand CEOs. In the world of high-end real estate, privacy is an increasingly prized amenity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Islands in Exuma Cays, a 365-island archipelago in the Bahamas, have recently sold to producer/director Tyler Perry, spiritual leader Aga Khan and country singers Tim McGraw and Faith Hill, joining earlier arrivals Johnny Depp, David Copperfield and <span class="companylink">LVMH</span> Chairman and Chief Executive Bernard Arnault. Ms. Hill and Mr. McGraw are in the final stages of construction on a roughly 15,000-square-foot, four-bedroom home on their 17-acre island, Goat Cay, which they purchased a few years ago, according to people familiar with the project. Mr. Perry bought a 25-acre island called White Bay Cay as well as a nearby seven-acre island in 2009, and is currently building a tropical/Balinese-style home with several guest bungalows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the weak economy, the number of millionaires in the U.S. and their combined net worth hit record highs in 2010, with investible assets up more than 8.4% from 2009, according to the World Wealth Report by <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span> and <span class="companylink">Capgemini</span>. Several record-breaking real-estate sales this year have buoyed optimism in the ultra-high end of the market, including the $85 million sale of a Los Angeles estate owned by Candy Spelling earlier this month. In March, a Russian buyer paid $100 million for a home in Silicon Valley, the highest price ever paid for a single-family home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Island development projects can take years -- at least one under way now involves 150 workers. Locals say one of the biggest private resort projects under construction in the Exumas is a compound whose principal investors are the co-founders of California-based retailer <span class="companylink">Fry's Electronics</span>, brothers John, Randy and David Fry and Kathy Kolder. On a group of eight islands known as Bock Cay, the project calls for a staff village with about 35 homes for employees, a main clubhouse and six guest estates built in various styles, including an Italian villa. Fifteen hundred palm trees have been imported. One unusual private-island feature in the works: an 18-hole Nick Faldo-designed golf course with at least one drive that goes over the ocean to reach a hole on a nearby island that's also part of the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for Fry's says an opening date hasn't yet been set, and that the island will likely be available as a very high-end rental in the model of Sir Richard Branson's Necker Island in the British Virgin Islands. (Weekly rates at Mr. Branson's island start at $54,500 per night for up to 28 guests.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Exuma Cays (pronounced "Keys" by most locals and regulars) have many of the ingredients for a destination for the extremely wealthy: sandy beaches, turquoise water and limited development possibilities -- 90% of the islands are either uninhabitable or protected as part of a 176-square-mile marine park. The growing ease of staying connected with cable and the Internet, as well as improved desalination and diesel-generator technology, have also made the islands more attractive, says Tom Lawson, a resident who has developed, owned or managed several private-island properties there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The relatively large number of islands makes the Exumas generally more affordable than other exclusive destinations like the Seychelles, says Farhad Vladi, the Germany-based founder of Vladi Private Islands, a private-island real-estate company. Although prices for islands in the Exumas have doubled in the last decade, the Seychelles cost even more because of their scarcity and extreme privacy, with most basic islands selling for around $30 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the Exumas' relative lack of tourist infrastructure has kept them somewhat under the radar -- people often arrive by yacht, sea plane or helicopter -- although they are relatively close to the U.S. "I can be there for three or four days and you really don't see anybody," says Eddie Irvine, a former Formula One racecar driver from Northern Ireland who purchased an undeveloped island in the area about a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve and Patrick Harrington, former investment banker brothers originally from Chicago, have purchased islands in the Exumas for investment and development purposes. One they've recently put on the market for $22 million has a 4,000-square-foot house, two miles of coastline and 145 acres of land purchased in 2006. Steve Harrington says he's drawn to the English-speaking, stable Bahamian government and the pristine "Corona commercial look."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building a luxury home on a remote island means importing everything from electricity to cellphone towers to water purifiers. Eduardo Martinez, a Miami-based architect who has designed homes and interiors for several island owners in the Exuma Cays, says that the first step is dredging a marina, then building temporary houses and dining facilities for staff, the majority of whom legally have to be local Bahamians. A typical project takes at least 2 1/2 years. "The closest lumber yard is in Fort Lauderdale," says Mr. Martinez. "You can't run to the corner and get nails and concrete."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building materials must be imported on large barges, which take about two days to make the trip from Florida, weather permitting. For islands without an existing power source, electricity comes from diesel generators, which also must be imported. According to Ed Bosarge, the principal beneficiary of the trust that owns a land-lease and building rights to Yonder Cay, just south of Mr. Depp's island, commonly used diesel generators can generate a power bill as high as $1 million a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real-estate bust did affect these shores, with islands sitting longer and often selling for lower prices. An unnamed, 681-acre island with an airstrip, a seven-bedroom, six-bathroom timber-frame main house, a gym and staff buildings has been on the market for $55 million for 2 1/2 years. Earlier this month, it was offered in a sealed-bid auction. The listing broker, George Damianos, says two reasonable offers have been received, but a sale hasn't been finalized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the least expensive on the market now is Nicolas Cage's former island, Leaf Cay, which remains completely undeveloped and is available for $8.5 million. At the top end of the market is Cave Cay, a 250-acre island priced at $110 million that has its own harbor and runway. Listing broker John Christie, of H.G. Christie, says there are several buildings on the property, some of which are not yet completed. He says it has been on the market for about a year and the sellers are open to offers for less than the listing price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's definitely a buyer's market right now," says Kevin Cross, a Nassau-based real-estate broker. But he and others say buyers are emerging. "We're getting real buyers looking in the $30 million to $50 million price range," says Mr. Christie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Movie stars, royalty and old-money families have yachted around the Exumas and vacationed on the main island, Great Exuma, since at least the 1950s. On the market right now is Children's Bay Cay, the $37.5 million former vacation playground of Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn, who vacationed on the island in their movie-making heydays in the 1950s and '60s. It's been owned by heirs to the <span class="companylink">Johnson &amp; Johnson</span> family fortune. They couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the 1970s and 1980s, however, the area's reputation was marred when drug smugglers used the islands as a key trafficking point to smuggle cocaine to the U.S. from South America. Norman's Cay was once the headquarters for Medellin cartel leader Carlos Lehder, before he was arrested in 1987. The Bahamian government eventually stabilized, and tourism in the country began to thrive in the late 1990s with the construction of massive resorts on Nassau and Paradise Island. (Another massive resort, Baha Mar, a $3.4 billion hotel and casino, is currently under construction in Nassau.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the best-known private-island compound is magician David Copperfield's 700-acre resort Musha Cay, which is spread across 11 islands. He purchased several of the islands a little over five years ago for more than $50 million and spent almost another $30 million gut-renovating and expanding his ultra-high-end resort there. There are five guest houses with private beaches, an outdoor movie theater and an on-site staff of 30 that includes a masseuse and sommelier. Visitors can rent the entire property, which has 40 private beaches and sleeps up to 24, for rates starting at $37,500 a night, including meals and beverages. (Penelope Cruz was married there, as was <span class="companylink">Google</span> co-founder Sergey Brin.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Copperfield describes it as a place where he can "create magic in three dimensions" and where a stay can include an optional, interactive treasure hunt where he says guests are immersed in a "living movie." (Dozens of actors and illusionists are imported to play pirates.) Recent additions to the resort include trained macaws that pick up Musha Cay's refuse and a "secret village," opening soon, where visitors can interact with tame monkeys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Exumas' newest neighbors could be moving in soon. Ms. Hill and Mr. McGraw's home on Goat Cay, a previously undeveloped island, is nearly completed and includes a single-story tropical-plantation-style main house with a lookout tower, and three smaller homes for a manager and staff, according to people familiar with the project. A representative for the couple declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tyler Perry's island retreat, White Bay Cay, was also previously undeveloped and consists of a 25-acre island and a seven-acre island relatively close by; both are near Mr. Depp's island. (The 25-acre island was listed at one point for $7 million.) The spread, which is still being completed, includes a 14,000-square-foot main house and five to six smaller guest bungalows. There's also a spa, a tennis court and a marina. Mr. Perry's representative said he had no comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Aga Khan, the Muslim spiritual leader and philanthropist, purchased 349-acre Bell Island in 2009 for $100 million, according to public records. Gail Lockhart Charles, the Bahamas-based representative for the Aga Khan, said that the existing homes on the island -- flat, concrete structures built to maximize water views and minimize potential hurricane damage -- are being renovated to create a "private family retreat." Also in the works is a native-plant nursery and landscaping with indigenous plants and flowers. Ms. Lockhart says the project is scheduled to be finished in about six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, owners have been toning down the glitzy look. The latest trend is to build slightly less opulent homes that use solar power and are self-sustainable, Mr. Martinez says, though that can add to the overall cost. (Johnny Depp's island, Little Hall's Pond Cay, has at least some solar power. A representative for Mr. Depp said he had no comment.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Former race-car driver Mr. Irvine says on his island, electricity will be provided by solar panels and solar-powered batteries; transportation will be by kayak or bicycle. Mr. Irvine says he's working on a water-making facility and plans to try to source most of what he eats while there from the island itself. "If you want to be living the Palm Beach lifestyle, live in Palm Beach," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bosarge of Yonder Cay claims the island will be the first of its size in the Caribbean to be entirely powered by renewable energy. The 70-acre island now has 10 wind-turbine generators, solar power with backup batteries and a reverse-osmosis water-purification system that will make 21,000 gallons of water a day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To complete Yonder Cay by its November deadline, the project's Houston-based chief operating officer, David Houston, says there's currently staff of 150 on the island, 110 of whom are living there in temporary housing. The rest are ferried back and forth to a populated island, with existing housing, in the morning and evening.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Dawn Wotapka and Robbie Whelan   </div><div>454 words</div><div>29 July 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two of the nation's largest home builders reported weak quarterly financial results Thursday, but their stocks rallied after an industry report indicated future sales could be stronger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The positive news came as the National Association of Realtors reported that its index of pending home sales, which tracks how many home buyers have signed purchase contracts, jumped 2.4% in June from the previous month to 90.9, the index's highest reading since March 2011. When compared with a year earlier, pending sales were up 20%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers who sign sale contracts often complete their purchases within 60 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in pending home sales could suggest "a stabilizing market in coming months," said Doug Duncan, the chief economist of the government-backed mortgage company <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>. But he cautioned that contract signings don't always become closings and that contract cancellations have been rising in recent months. He also warned that the labor market will have to improve before housing can truly recover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were tentative signs that such improvements could be coming. The Labor Department reported Thursday that initial jobless claims fell below 400,000 for the first time since early April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although claims remain high, economists generally think the economy is adding more jobs than it is shedding once the weekly claims figure falls below 400,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those reports helped to lift sentiment among investors, who awakened Thursday morning to the weak news from home builders. Hours before the stock market opened, Fort Worth, Texas-based <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span>, the nation's largest home builder by annual closings, reported a fiscal-third-quarter profit of $28.7 million, or nine cents a share, down from $50.5 million, or 16 cents a share a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Horton's closest competitor, <span class="companylink">PulteGroup Inc</span>., based in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., reported a second-quarter loss of $55.4 million, compared with net income of $76.3 million, or 20 cents a share, a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The builders suffered from lower revenue and charges. Buyers, who can no longer tap the federal home-buyer tax credit, closed on fewer new homes built by Pulte and Horton in the most recent quarter than they had a year earlier. "Simply put, we need more jobs and better consumer confidence before meaningful recovery can occur," Pulte Chief Executive Richard Dugas said in a conference call Thursday morning with analysts and investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, by midday, builder stocks were generally showing gains. Pulte's stock ultimately closed at $6.80 a share, down 2.86% from Wednesday's close. Horton closed at $11.90 a share, up 2.59%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices and sales of new homes lost ground in recent months, with real-estate agents and builders saying the debt-ceiling debate in Washington is rattling an already-fragile market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller home price index, released Tuesday, prices for existing homes in 20 major U.S. cities fell 4.5% in May from a year earlier, with declines stretching from coast to coast. Only Washington, D.C., saw a year-over-year increase. Compared with April, prices in May were virtually unchanged on a seasonally adjusted basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you're looking for the light at the end of the tunnel, we don't have it," said David Blitzer, chairman of S&amp;P's index committee. "We all agree the market ain't going anyplace at all."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a month-to-month, seasonally adjusted basis, prices were up in nine cities, led by Washington (up 1.4%) and Boston (up 1.2%). Prices in 11 cities were lower, led by Detroit (down 3.4%) and Tampa (down 1.5%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Census Bureau reported Tuesday that new-home sales fell 1% in June from a month earlier to an annual rate of 312,000 units. That was weaker than many economists were expecting and puts the current sales pace below last year's total of 323,000 sales, which was the lowest annual total on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said the housing market continues to be hampered by tight lending standards that are keeping buyers on the sidelines, as well as by high unemployment -- the national rate now stands at 9.2%. The political battle between Republicans and Democrats in Washington over raising the debt ceiling has injected fresh worries to the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers, wary that borrowing costs could increase, are canceling purchase contracts and delaying making a decision until the situation in Washington is resolved. This is "a new curve ball in the housing market," said Jason Haber, chief executive of Rubicon Property, a Manhattan-based brokerage. "It just adds uncertainty."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in Washington -- the only market to show price increases from a year earlier according to the S&amp;P Case-Shiller index -- some realtors warn that conditions are changing and buyers are starting to worry about government layoffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've got listings from $960,000 to $200,000 and nothing is moving," said Chuck Riley, a realtor with RE/MAX Allegiance in Washington, D.C. "Anyone who tells you this is an easy market is lying to you."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While sales of new homes fell short of expectations, the report contained a few bright notes. The inventory of homes available for sale declined to 164,000, after seasonal adjustments. That total represents a 6.3-month supply, which is the lowest inventory level on record and shows that builders have worked through much of their excess supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price in June for newly constructed single-family homes climbed 7.2% from a year earlier to $235,000. Few industry watchers say they believe the rise reflects price increases by builders. Instead, they say, it likely represents a change in the mix of homes purchased, with more high-end or move-up homes selling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some builders are optimistic. Eric Lipar, chief executive of LGI Homes, a Houston-based builder of entry-level houses, said he sold 53 homes in June, up from 25 a year earlier. "It's going pretty well for us," he said, "but we're probably the exception."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've got listings from $960,000 to $200,000 and nothing is moving," said Chuck Riley, a realtor with RE/MAX Allegiance in Washington D.C. "Anyone who tells you this is an easy market is lying to you."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While sales of new homes fell short of expectations, the report contained a few bright notes. The inventory of homes available for sale declined to 164,000, after seasonal adjustments. That total represents a 6.3-month supply, which is the lowest inventory level on record and shows that builders have worked through much of their excess supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price in June for newly constructed single-family homes climbed 7.2% from a year earlier to $235,000. Few industry watchers say they believe the rise reflects price increases by builders. Instead, they say, it likely represents a change in the mix of homes purchased, with more high-end or move-up homes selling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some builders are optimistic. Eric Lipar, chief executive of LGI Homes, a Houston-based builder of entry-level houses, said he sold 53 homes in June, up from 25 a year earlier. He credits advertising to renters in nearby communities who can own an entry-level home for less than their rent."It's going pretty well for us," he said, "but we're probably the exception."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers turned more confident in July, despite persistent troubles in the labor and housing markets. Separate data indicated U.S. home prices moved sideways in May, while new-home sales dropped in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conference Board said on Tuesday that its July index of consumer confidence hit 59.5, from 57.6 in June. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had expected the index to come in at 55.4. The report said its index of present conditions fell to 35.7, from June's 36.6, while the expectations index hit 75.4, from 71.6 last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer sentiment has been under pressure from a wide array of bad news. Weak growth, persistently high unemployment and troubled housing markets, combined with rising food and energy prices and the crisis over U.S. government borrowing, are all conspiring to weigh on the mood of households. How much of that sentiment translates into reduced consumer spending isn't always clear, but it is not a help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Consumer confidence posted a modest gain in July, the result of an improvement in consumers' short-term outlook," Conference Board survey director Lynn Franco said. "Consumers' appraisal of current business and employment conditions, however, was less favorable as concerns about the labor market continue to weigh on consumers' attitudes," she said, adding that "consumers remain apprehensive about the future."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices rose in May from a month earlier as the spring selling season got under way, but they remained below year-earlier levels, according to the S&amp;P Case-Shiller home-price indexes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller index of 10 major metropolitan areas rose 1.1%, and the 20-city index was up 1% in May from April. However, adjusted for seasonal factors, the 10-city figure edged up 0.1%, while the 20-city index was flat. Year-to-year, prices fell 3.6% and 4.5%, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though 16 cities reported higher prices month-to-month, prices fell in Detroit, Las Vegas and Tampa, and were flat in Phoenix. Year-to-year, Washington, D.C., was the only market that improved, up 1.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices had risen sequentially in April for the first time in eight months, though most of the improvement was seen as reflecting the beginning of the spring-summer home-buying season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is a seasonal period of stronger demand for houses, so monthly price increases are to be expected," said David Blitzer, chairman of S&amp;P's index committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has been struggling amid high unemployment, an abundance of foreclosures and tighter mortgage requirements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales fell unexpectedly in June. Sales declined 1% on a monthly basis to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 312,000, the Commerce Department said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AMSTERDAM -- When Terremark Worldwide Inc. looked for a new European data-center location, the Miami-based information-technology company found Amsterdam's airport city to be a natural fit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides having the data capabilities necessary, there are also an additional 500 global firms located at the airport city -- all potential or existing customers. Plus, <span class="companylink">Schiphol Group</span>, the airport's owner, was able to offer an existing office building and room to expand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Terremark, a unit of <span class="companylink">Verizon Communications Inc</span>., started construction in February and expects to open the first stage of the new data center in September. "The airport was a bonus," adds Egbert Veldhuis, marketing manager for Terremark in Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Terremark's reasons for choosing Schiphol help explain why it is emerging as one of the leading airport cities in the world. These cities are popping up throughout the world around major international airports. Their mixes of office buildings, warehouses, hotels, stores and other properties often are as tied into the rest of the world as they are into their home cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Schiphol had a major head start because they understood [the airport-city concept] and leveraged it," says John Kasarda, co-author of "Aerotropolis: The Way We'll Live Next" and a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. "For awhile, it had a major lead in airport-city development, although some others are starting to catch up."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Netherlands owns about a 70% stake in <span class="companylink">Schiphol Group</span>, which owns the airport and much of its surrounding property for a total of 540,000 square meters (5.8 million square feet). Companies that have made Schiphol their European headquarters include distribution giant <span class="companylink">ProLogis Inc</span>., private-equity leader <span class="companylink">CVC Capital Partners</span> and <span class="companylink">Microsoft Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It grew organically, but not by accident," says Maarten de Groof, chief commercial officer at Schiphol. "We've always had a vision for this airport city, to build and develop."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for space at Schiphol have driven up its prime rents to as much as 360 euros a square meter ($49 a square foot) annually, according to <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>. By comparison, average prime rents are 335 euros a square meter ($45 a square foot) in Amsterdam Zuidas, the city's prime business district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies pick Schiphol over other airport cities such as Paris, Frankfurt or Heathrow, in part because of favorable Dutch tax laws, says Sven Bertens, an Amsterdam-based researcher with <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other factors include clusters of companies in complementary business fields and a government office called "Holland Gateway" inside Schiphol's World Trade Center. It allows companies and businessmen to start paperwork for visas and other necessary documents without traveling to a myriad of buildings in the city center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The airport sees 45.2 million passengers and transports 1.5 million tons of cargo annually. The airport city also employs 60,000 people, and the real estate is divided up nearly evenly into office and warehouse space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The airport first founded an internal dedicated real-estate development company about a decade ago. In partnership with local municipalities, the airport has bought up much of the surrounding land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Schiphol also owns and manages most of the buildings on airport-city property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owning the property makes it different from other airport cities, where outside developers often buy up and build office space, says Mr. de Groof. That gives Schiphol more maneuverability in choosing the best mix of companies, both for planning purposes and for attracting complementary businesses that boost the value of the airport location.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, during the downturn, Schiphol was willing to be flexible on lease terms to enable companies to keep their location in the airport city, Mr. de Groof says. Or Schiphol might accept a lower rent to attract a logistics company that would add attractive services to other tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Schiphol Group</span> had net profit of 169 million euros in 2010, up from 132 million euros in 2009. While 58% of the airport's revenue was generated by the aviation business and only 12% from real estate, aviation is much less profitable, generating only 15% of Schiphol's profit. Real estate contributes 32% of the company's profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Bombardier Inc</span>. opened an Aircraft Service Center at Schiphol a little over a year ago as its second European repairs and service center location in Europe after Berlin. The facility has 45,639 square feet of hangar space and 50 employees and is increasing staffing and aircraft capabilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Of course, we analyzed all those facilities and, in the end, Amsterdam won out, and we're very happy with it," says Marc Duchesne, a Bombardier spokesman. Reasons for the decision included the central location of Amsterdam and an already existing hangar ready for occupancy, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The airport has worked hard to make its terminal area more desirable as a layover destination, with a free art museum, an inside playground, upscale retail shops and a library.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The goal is to make Schiphol "the preferred" European airport, Mr. de Groof says. "As soon as you think you're there, you're on a slippery slope," adds Mr. de Groof. "There's no place for complacency."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- New-home sales fell unexpectedly in June, highlighting continuing softness in a feeble part of the U.S. economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales fell 1% on a monthly basis to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 312,000, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast sales would rise 1.2% to an annual rate of 323,000. Sales are far short of healthy levels, considered to be an annual rate of around 750,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builderswere feeling good about their prospects at the start of the year. But the spring buying season has been slow. Last week, the National Association of Realtors reported that sales of existing homes fell to a seven-month low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite soft demand, new-home prices increased. The median price for a new home sold last month was $235,200, up 7.2% from $219,500 a year earlier and up 5.8% on a monthly basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders steadily cut back on construction throughout the housing bust, and the supply of new homes on the market is now at 164,000, the lowest on record dating to 1963. That supply would take about six months to exhaust, roughly what economists consider healthy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The struggling housing market has been a burden on the overall economy, though there have been some modest signs of stability in prices of late. The S&amp;P Case-Shiller index of home prices in 20 major U.S. metropolitan areas, also released Tuesday, was up 1% in May from April. However, adjusted for seasonal factors, the 20-city index was flat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deeply discounted foreclosure sales have been tough competition for builders. About 2.2 million properties have been foreclosed but have yet to go up for sale, according to <span class="companylink">Lender Processing Services Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government incentives, such as a tax credit that mainly benefited first-time home buyers, helped home sales last year. But the housing market has faltered since it expired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales fell 15.8% in the Northeast and 12.7% in the West. Sales were up 9.5% in the Midwest and 3.4% in the South.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is taking steps to be more frugal and salvage its budget for major projects—one of the largest sources of construction spending in the region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency said Wednesday that it had cut the cost of the five-year plan by $2 billion, to $24 billion. The MTA's capital budget pays for projects such as the Second Avenue subway, new train cars and buses, subway station rehabilitation and general system maintenance that keeps trains from derailing and buses from breaking down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the savings came from changing the way the MTA administers contracts and does construction work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The authority is also cutting the administrative payroll by 15%, reducing how frequently it runs shuttle buses when construction shuts down subway service, and pushing contractors to keep their costs down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In return, the MTA says it's trying to address issues that contractors say make the agency an expensive customer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the authority needs to find another $9 billion to pay for all of the five-year plan, which is supposed to last until 2014 but runs out of money at the end of this year. The authority and the state Legislature agreed to fund the first two years of the plan last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The MTA's troubles mirror those of transit systems and highway operators around the country, which are trying to figure out how to repair aging infrastructure in the face of high debt and increasingly parsimonious state and federal governments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The MTA is between a rock and a hard place. The rock is the enormous capital needs of the regional transit system," said Richard Anderson, president of the New York Building Congress, a group that represents the construction industry. "The hard place is the political reality that new sources of revenue are difficult, if not impossible, in this governmental climate."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The MTA's capital budget has big implications for Mr. Anderson's members. He estimates that if the agency gets the money it's looking for, it would account for 25% of the city's construction activity next year. Another industry group, the General Contractors Association, says MTA capital spending pays for about half of the 20,000 workers employed by its members.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Without public work, this industry would be in a depression," Mr. Anderson said. "The private side is already in a depression."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not clear where the MTA will find the rest of the needed money. As the MTA was cutting costs, it reduced by $1 billion its projections for funding from the federal government, which pays for about a third of the capital plan. The authority had expected Congress to pass a new transportation funding bill this year, but it has yet to do so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The MTA has applied for a $3 billion federal loan that comes with generous repayment terms. That would help pay for projects but add to the agency's already heavy debt burden. It could also restructure its debt and borrow more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the agency has yet to ask for new revenue, whether in the form of taxes or higher fares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We recognize that there's no appetite for new taxes in New York today," MTA Chairman Jay Walder said in a statement.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales in June fell to a seven-month low, and the number of contract cancellations soared, signaling that buyers are rethinking home purchases amid national economic uncertainty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales decreased 0.8% from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.77 million, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday. It was the third-straight monthly drop and puts this year's pace behind last year's 4.91 million homes sold, which had marked the weakest sales in 13 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price was $184,300, up 0.8% from $182,900 a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing market has been two steps forward, then two steps back," said Chris Mayer, an economics professor at Columbia University. "This is a sign of the lack of progress in developing a mortgage market that can take us past the housing crisis."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales were down 5.2% in the Northeast and 1.7% in the West, while other regions saw modest gains; sales were up 0.5% in the South and 1% in the Midwest. A separate report released Wednesday showed one bright spot for sales was Florida. Second-quarter home sales in Miami were up 13.5% from last year, and hit a five-year high, according to brokerage Douglas Elliman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overall decline in home sales "suggests that the recent deterioration in economic conditions has already hit the housing market," according to Paul Dales, senior U.S. economist at the Toronto-based Capital Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most surprising is the spike in buyers who signed contracts for properties but then pulled out. In June, 16% of NAR member realtors reported having a would-be buyer cancel their contract, up from 4% in May. Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist, said the realtors reporting cancellations, which is higher than the 10% seen in a typical month, is due, at least in part, to shaky consumer confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It could be that buyers are having second thoughts because of the weakened economy," Mr. Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. added very few new jobs in June, and the ongoing battle over the debt ceiling between President Barack Obama and Republicans in Congress has hurt consumer confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"During the debt ceiling discussion there have been pronouncements from major politicians that we could be facing a catastrophe or a collapse," Mr. Yun says. "Anytime those kinds of dire words are used, someone who wants to make a major purchase is going to pause."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tight credit and low appraisals also may have factored into the uptick in cancellations, but since both factors have existed for months it is unlikely they are the driving force behind the June increases, Mr. Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say it will take large-scale job growth to persuade families to move out of rentals and back into houses. "With the unemployment rate still very high and rising, a major recovery is not in the cards," Mr. Dales said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2003, Wes and Liz Adams purchased this Georgia estate, known as Beaver Dam Farms, for $10.25 million from Kenny Rogers, according to property records (press reports have quoted a higher sale amount of about $12.3 million). Mr. Rogers is the country music singer and songwriter whose albums include "The Gambler." A representative for Mr. Rogers did not return a call for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The estate has a 12,000-square-foot main house in addition to six guesthouses, and a golf clubhouse, which contains a lounge, eating area and pro shop. Pictured here is the main house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Adams says the property was a vacation home that they only used a few weeks out of the year, although they hosted their daughter's wedding there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Adams says she decided to sell the property, which is outside of Athens, Ga., after her husband died in February. "Our family just doesn't use the property to its full potential."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2005, the Adamses turned the estate into a resort, also named Beaver Dam Farms. Mrs. Adams will entertain buyers looking to use the estate as a resort as well as those who plan to use it as a secondary or primary residence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The estate has a six-bedroom guesthouse, a four-bedroom guesthouse, and four one-bedroom villas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the estate's current furnishings were chosen by Mr. Rogers, Mrs. Adams says. The property's amenities are included in the asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other than some structural improvements, the current owners have left the estate largely unchanged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The centerpiece of the state is a private, 6,285-yard, 18-hole golf course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The course has been played by professional golfers during visits to the estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The estate also includes a clubhouse, a 90,000-square-feet equestrian and multi-use facility, two barns, a lake house, two swimming pools, clay tennis courts, a spa, conference center, various outdoor entertaining venues and three fish-stocked lakes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The asking price is $20 million. It is being marketed privately through a Beaver Dam Farms website.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Craig Karmin   </div><div>437 words</div><div>20 July 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Troubled German bank <span class="companylink">WestLB AG</span> is marketing a portfolio of loans backed by a diverse collection of hotels and resorts that include a ski lodge in Utah, a boutique hotel in lower Manhattan and a beach resort in Miami, according to the offering memorandum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this diversity might make it tough to sell the portfolio, which comprises 10 loans with a face value of about $342 million as well as two small properties that the bank owns. Some analysts suggested that the portfolio might attract bids of 60 to 70 cents on the dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The mix of hotels may make it harder to find one buyer who wants the whole portfolio," said Tom McConnell, senior managing director of global hospitality at broker Cushman &amp; Wakefield. But the Ger\man state that owns much of the bank may be looking to sell the loans quickly through a package, rather than trying to break them up, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WestLB was among a number of European banks that began lending aggressively to U.S. developers during the final years of the property market boom. Many of these loans went sour and contributed to financial stress at these banks. WestLB nearly collapsed during the financial crisis and is owned by the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia and regional savings banks. The Düsseldorf bank is negotiating a break-up plan with the European Union.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Fox, a hotel analyst at Colliers PKF Consulting, said WestLB's lending may seem more risky because, unlike some foreign lenders, the German bank provided financing for more speculative resort projects</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Some of the overseas banks got into markets they didn't know as well as the urban markets," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokeswoman for WestLB declined to comment. A hotel broker at <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>, the firm running the sale, also declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the loan portfolio includes the boutique Ace Hotel in Manhattan and the 285-room Loews Hotel New Orleans, it is also stocked with loans to a Cabo San Lucas resort and a luxury spa in the Utah desert.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The offering memorandum categorizes six of the 10 loans as performing. Some of these are part of a lending syndicate, which would make it harder for a new debtholder to gain control of the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mexico and St. John hotels could discourage many buyers who don't want or can't own overseas properties, and the complexity of some of the non-performing loans could make the portfolio less attractive to many real-estate investment trusts, some hotel analysts said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the new sustainable buildings popping up around Europe contain technology to make use of solar power and rainwater, and aim to transform surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But these state-of-the-art developments in cities like Madrid and Paris haven't resolved the debate over whether going green pays off for investors. While new buildings generally have adopted green designs, the economic argument hasn't been strong enough to persuade most owners of existing properties to upgrade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, green advocates have said almost as a matter of faith that sustainable buildings command higher rents for owners and save occupiers money on utility bills, a situation in which everyone seems to win.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only problem: There has been too little statistical evidence to back up the claim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We believe there is a link between building sustainability and value. The challenge is to quantify it," said Richard Holberton, director of research for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at property firm <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span> in London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some have tried to do that. Nils Kok, a professor at Maastricht University in the Netherlands, published a study in May based on a comparison of 1,100 leasing transactions in the Dutch country from the combined databases of three large property agents in the Netherlands: <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis Group Inc</span>., DTZ Zadelhoff and <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle Inc</span>. The study concluded that nongreen buildings carried a 6.5% discount in price compared with green buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But proving the green-building investment case hasn't been made easier by the recession. Since property markets crashed in 2007, property leasing and investment activity has declined so much that the data may be skewed and not allow assessors to draw clear distinctions between sustainable buildings and the rest of the market, said Mr. Holberton of <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, green architecture has become standard in new construction. The Generali Tower, a building under construction in Paris's La Defense district, will generate electricity with wind turbines installed on the top of the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new headquarters for <span class="companylink">Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA</span>, designed by Swiss architects Herzog &amp; de Meuron, is being built outside of Madrid in a desert-like environment. BBVA said in 2008 when the bank unveiled the design of the structure that it envisioned energy savings of 30%, a 35% reduction in greenhouse gases, up to 50% lower water usage and 70% savings in waste treatment. The buildings are low, three-story structures that are laid out like a carpet atop the landscape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The investment case for an owner-occupier like BBVA is clear. But the case is harder to make for owners to convert their properties to green buildings. They need to be convinced that tenants will pay a high enough premium to be in a green building to justify the higher cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There also is a bit of confusion because there are two main green certificates issued. In the U.K., there is the Building Research Establishment's Environmental Assessment Method. In the U.S., the Green Building Council publishes the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design standard, or LEED.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both certificates measure more than just energy efficiency. They also take other factors into consideration that include waste management, air quality and access to public transportation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dan Probst, Chicago-based chairman of energy and sustainability services at <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>, said that when he went to the trouble of doing an analysis of the major certificates, he found them to be "fairly similar."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It does appear that LEED is becoming more prevalent outside the U.S.," said Mr. Probst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason that may be happening is many multinational corporations will tend to choose one certification that they will use world-wide. For example, when <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank AG</span> renovated its Frankfurt headquarters in 2006, it brought the twin towers up to U.S. LEED standards.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The growth in technology businesses that has boosted the San Francisco office market has spilled over into a blighted six-block stretch of Market Street that until now has missed out on most booms in the city's commercial-property valuations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The "midmarket" office corridor on the southern edge of the Tenderloin district got its first boost in April when <span class="companylink">Twitter Inc</span>. announced plans to relocate its headquarters to the gritty area better known for empty storefronts and government workers than Internet buzz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now a quasigovernment agency, California's State Compensation Insurance Fund, is taking advantage of the new interest in the area to sell its 17-story former headquarters at 1275 Market St.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We wanted to take advantage of the market in San Francisco right now," said Denise Burian, the fund's real-estate manager. "The Twitter deal in midmarket San Francisco has positively [affected] the area."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Burian declined to identify the buyer who has signed a contract to buy the property or the price. But people familiar with the matter said a venture of TMG Partners, a privately held San Francisco real-estate company, and New York hedge fund <span class="companylink">Fortress Investment Group LLC</span>, is paying about $48 million, or about $125 a square foot, for the property. A Fortress spokeswoman declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until now, the San Francisco office-building market has been recovering from the downturn but hasn't done so as strongly as top markets like Washington and New York. In those cities, some trophy properties have been trading near peak values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That isn't so in the San Francisco area, which had a second-quarter vacancy rate of 14.7%, compared with 9% and 10.7% for Washington and New York, respectively. Office-building investors are accepting yields, or an annual return, between 4% and 5% in Washington and New York, according to research firm Green Street Advisors. In San Francisco, they are demanding yields in the low 5% range. The city still has more to go to get back to the frothy peak of the city's market in 2007, when investors paid as much as $1,000 a square foot for office buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But San Francisco may get a bump soon thanks to growth plans of companies like Twitter and <span class="companylink">Google Inc</span>. Indeed, the San Francisco region's "effective" office rent, which includes free rent and other landlord concessions, rose 6%, to $31.23 a square foot, in the second quarter from the year earlier, according to research firm <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>. That is the highest percentage increase of the 79 metropolitan areas surveyed by Reis, though still below the $36.11 peak touched in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An increase in information-technology jobs has helped bolster the economic recovery in northern California. The San Francisco area's unemployment rate fell to 9.3% in May from 10% a year earlier and below the state's 11.4% level, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision to sell 1275 Market St. wasn't a tough one for the State Compensation Insurance Fund. Not only is the market improving, but the provider of workers' compensation has seen its work force shrink in recent years. It hopes to realize some $200 million in savings by reducing its real-estate costs throughout the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 385,000-square-foot building with views of San Francisco Bay and the city skyline was built for the fund in 1977 for about $33 million. The agency put it up for sale in April, around the time that Twitter announced plans to move its headquarters about five blocks from 795 Folsom St. to 1355 Market St.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TMG Partners, which has developed about 20 million square feet of property in the Bay area, is clearly bullish on the technology sector. Last year, the firm led by Michael Covarrubias lured <span class="companylink">Zynga Inc</span>., the developer of such online games as "FarmVille" and "Mafia Wars," to another property outside the financial district, 699 Eighth St.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TMG also has recently acquired other vacant buildings. In May, the developer was part of a joint venture that raised eyebrows when it paid roughly $300 a square foot for a vacant building at 500 Terry Francois Blvd. in San Francisco, according to research firm <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 1275 Market St., TMG faces a tough leasing challenge. The State Compensation Insurance Fund plans to vacate the building entirely by October. It remains to be seen how tight fiscal budgets will further shrink government tenants and whether other technology companies will follow Twitter's move, said Colin Yasukochi, vice president of research with real-estate-services company <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Twitter was the first mover," Mr. Yasukochi said. "It's an area that's being legitimized."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A San Francisco office building at 1275 Market St. was constructed in 1977 for California's State Compensation Insurance Fund. An earlier version of this story incorrectly said 1275 Market Street was built in 1997.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. housing construction rose in June to its highest level since January, but much of that growth was in the volatile multifamily sector and reflects a rebound from bad weather earlier in the spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts rose 14.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 629,000, according to the Commerce Department. Yet that number remained well below the one million units considered to be a healthy level, and economists hesitated to call a bottom in the home-construction market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Better construction levels are better than not, but regional variation and the lack of growth in single-family permits suggest catch up construction is under way rather than something more fundamental," said Steve Blitz, senior economist at ITG Investment Research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of single-family homes, which made up about 70% of all starts, grew by 9.4% from a month earlier. June was only marginally better than last June, which was the worst since record keeping began in 1959.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of multifamily homes with at least two units, a volatile part of the market, was up 30.4% on a monthly basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newly issued building permits, a gauge of future construction, rose 2.5% from a month earlier to an annual rate of 624,000, the highest level since December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data suggest that strong demand for apartments, driven by more families choosing to rent instead of buy, are leading housing's recovery. In the second quarter, the national vacancy rate was 5.9%, the lowest since early 2008, according to <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>. The effective rent, or amount paid after discounts, continued rising to $997.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The fundamentals are the strongest that we've seen in many years," said Jeffrey Friedman, chief executive of <span class="companylink">Associated Estates Realty Corp</span>., an apartment operator with a vacancy rate of less than 4% and about 250 units under construction. "Everyone who's building new units today expects that they'll be filled very quickly."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A flurry of apartment construction is trying to meet demand, said David Crowe, chief economist of the National Association of Home Builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few apartments have been built in recent years, and developers are rushing to meet the increased demand as homeowners burned by the housing crash and those who moved home or in with friends during the downturn feel confident enough to secure their own places. Landlords nationwide report few vacant units, which is allowing them to boost rents in many markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have some catch-up," Mr. Crowe said. "We're going to have more renters. You've got to start early to meet" the increased demand.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An investor who purchased a Times Square office tower at the peak of the market is moving to put it on the block in a deal that would test how high trophy Manhattan commercial real estate prices have risen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yonkers, N.Y.-based AVR Realty Co. purchased 5 Times Square, the tower that houses the U.S. headquarters of <span class="companylink">Ernst &amp; Young</span>, in February 2007 for $1.28 billion. The company has hired <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span> with an eye to putting the 1.1-million -square-foot property on the block for a hoped-for profit, according to Stephen Siegel, the firm's global chairman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Siegel says AVR will decide whether to market the building in the fall. "It's a fabulous asset, a magnificent building where there's very limited risk," he said in an interview Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the uncertain economic recovery, investors have been bidding up prices for Manhattan commercial property. If AVR successfully sells 5 Times Square for a profit it would be a sign that trophy buildings here are now trading at record values. "The sales market is picking up, and the question is: Does it keep going?" Mr. Siegel said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several prime Manhattan properties have already sold this year, to foreign buyers, institutional investors and other buyers. For example, J.P. Morgan Asset Management recently purchased 200 Fifth Ave. for about $700 million. Another Times Square property, 750 Seventh Ave., sold to Kuwait-based Fosterlane Management Corp. for $485 million, or $820 per square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan commercial property has been seeing high demand partly because the economy here is outperforming most of the rest of the country, driving rents up and vacancies down. Also, with the stock market anemic and interest rates low, even a historically low return on a Manhattan property looks relatively attractive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this climate, many owners have put their buildings on the block. For example, Beacon Capital Partners recently put the office skyscraper at 1211 Sixth Ave. up for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But AVR's hope for a profit on a possible sale of 5 Times Square might be optimistic. The company purchased the building from <span class="companylink">Boston Properties Inc</span>. for $1,162 per square foot in 2007 -- well above what most properties have traded for this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AVR financed its purchase of the building, at Seventh Ave. and 42nd St., with a $1.1 billion loan from <span class="companylink">Wachovia Corp</span>. that was sold to investors as commercial mortgage backed securities. The building's income was insufficient to cover the loan's interest for the first five years, according to loan documents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property's cash flow will cover the interest payments starting in 2012, when <span class="companylink">Ernst &amp; Young</span>'s rent will increase, according to Trepp LLC, which monitors the CMBS market. The building also likely received a bump in revenue from a retail lease to Sephora in late 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The location, long-term tenancy and contractual rent increases are especially appealing to foreign buyers and institutional investors," says Arthur Milston, managing director at Savills US, a real estate advisory firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AVR Realty didn't respond to requests for comment. The company was founded 45 years ago by Allan Rose, the son of a Brooklyn garment worker. Its national portfolio has grown to include more than 30 million square feet of office, hotel and residential properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rose's most prominent purchase prior to 5 Times Square was the Brill Building, a famed music industry hub at 1619 Broadway, for which AVR paid a premium price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rose conceded in an online television interview in December 2009 that the company also likely overpaid for 5 Times Square. "Everybody was in that irrational exuberance in those days and we probably paid too much for the building," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 39-story tower on Seventh Avenue between 41st and 42nd streets was developed by Boston Properties in 2002. It was one of a cluster of buildings that were vital to the rebirth of Times Square, including the Durst Organization's Four Times Square and the Reuters Building.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From Reason Magazine</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December 2003, Bruce Ratner, a real estate tycoon and part-owner of the New Jersey Nets basketball team, held a press conference in New York City to announce his latest project, a 22-acre "urban utopia" called the Atlantic Yards. The idea was to transform downtown Brooklyn by erecting 16 office and residential skyscrapers, a luxury 180-room hotel, and a fancy new arena for the Nets. Standing by Ratner's side that day was the architect Frank Gehry, who told the press he was particularly excited "to build a whole neighborhood practically from scratch."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a revealing statement. After all, the Atlantic Yards wasn't going to be built on top of a blank slate. More than half of those 22-acres were privately-owned, with the properties ranging from small businesses and modest brownstone apartment buildings to luxury condominiums that sold for $500,000 or more. To build the Atlantic Yards from scratch meant you had to first wipe part of an existing neighborhood off the map.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which is precisely what Ratner set out to do—only he didn't go about it the old-fashioned way, by contacting each property owner and making them a handsome cash offer. Instead Ratner turned to his powerful friends in the government, including his old Columbia law school buddy Gov. George Pataki, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz, a buffoonish figure eager to prattle on about how the Atlantic Yards would make up for the loss of the Brooklyn Dodgers. But most importantly, Ratner reached out to New York's Empire State Development Corporation (ESDC), the secretive state agency with the power to seize private property via eminent domain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The depressing and infuriating story of what happened next is the subject of Michael Galinsky and Suki Hawley's riveting new documentary Battle for Brooklyn, which tells the story of the Atlantic Yards land grab largely through the eyes of property owner Daniel Goldstein, who spent seven long years trying and failing to save his home from Ratner's state-sanctioned bulldozers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drawn from hundreds of hours of footage shot over the entire seven year saga that began with Ratner's 2003 press conference and ended with the razing of the building containing Goldstein's condo, Battle for Brooklyn gives audiences the rare opportunity to watch a massive government swindle unfold before their eyes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the film makes clear, this was a textbook case of eminent domain abuse. Ratner wasn't building a bridge or a tunnel or anything else that might conceivably be described as a "public use" under the state constitution. It was a money-making deal orchestrated by a powerful real estate developer. And New York officials backed him every step of the way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For its part, the ESDC conveniently declared the proposed Atlantic Yards site to be "blighted," despite all evidence to the contrary. Never mind that Goldstein spent five years hunting for what he thought was going to be his dream home—the ESDC counted minor things like "weeds," "graffiti," and "underutilization" as examples of this so-called blight. Under those flimsy standards any property in the city could be seized and bulldozed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that wasn't even the worst of it. In a particularly noxious example of crony capitalism, the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA), the powerful agency that runs New York City's subways, buses, and commuter trains, struck a secret deal to sell Ratner a crucial piece of real estate—an 8-acre train yard—that lay at the center of the Atlantic Yards footprint, without first opening up the property for competitive bidding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response to the negative media attention generated by Goldstein and the activist group he helped found, Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn, the MTA announced in 2005 that it would entertain competitive bids after all, but only if those offers were submitted within a mere 42 days. Ratner's detailed plans had of course been in the works for years at that point, while his would-be competitors had to scramble to make the deadline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the real estate firm Extell did file on time, submitting a $150 million bid for the property. Ratner then countered with a lowball offer of just $50 million and still won the rights. That figure was later negotiated to $100 million, which was still significantly less than Extell's bid. Then in June 2009 the MTA bailed Ratner out once again, allowing him to pay a measly $20 million up front, with the remaining sum due over the next 22 years. As the film points out, this sweetheart deal went down at the same time the MTA was pleading poverty and raising the price of bus and subway fares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At its best, Battle for Brooklyn illustrates the scope of these mounting outrages while capturing Goldstein's shock and anger as he slowly realizes that the deck is truly stacked against him. But since the film clocks in at a lean 93-minutes, several other significant aspects of the story were only briefly addressed or left on the cutting room floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One such weakness is Battle for Brooklyn's treatment of the atrocious November 2009 decision by New York's Court of Appeals—the state's highest court—upholding the use of eminent domain. While there is a great scene showing Goldstein anxiously checking his computer for news of the ruling, the only real summary the audience receives is that "we lost."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, that's not the half of it. In its 6-1 ruling, the Court of Appeals actually admitted that the state's blight determination might be bogus and then went ahead and upheld it anyway. "It may be that the bar has now been set too low—that what will now pass as 'blight,' as that expression has come to be understood and used by political appointees to public corporations relying upon studies paid for by developers, should not be permitted to constitute a predicate for the invasion of property rights and the razing of homes and businesses," the majority declared. "But any such limitation upon the sovereign power of eminent domain as it has come to be defined in the urban renewal context is a matter for the Legislature, not the courts."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So much for an independent tribunal of justice. Indeed, as Judge Robert Smith acidly remarked in his lone dissent, "It is hard to imagine any court saying that a decision about whether an utterance is constitutionally protected speech, or whether a search was unreasonable, or whether a school district has been guilty of racial discrimination, is not primarily a judicial exercise."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, property rights now had second-class status in New York's highest court. Not only did the Court of Appeals rubber stamp this specific use of eminent domain, it basically announced that it would be rubber stamping future uses as well—which is precisely what the court did seven months later in Kaur v. Urban Development Corporation, where it approved the ESDC's controversial West Harlem land grab on behalf of Columbia University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If I had to do it all over again," Goldstein declares early in the film, "I would do the exact same thing." It's heartening to hear him say so. Let's hope Battle for Brooklyn inspires an army of future property rights activists. The people of New York are going to need their help.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China Displays a Rising Need</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For More Interest-Rate Increases</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Time for a rethink? Within China, speculation has been rife that the government is set to announce a targeted loosening of monetary policy. Most China economists think the central bank is done raising interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Wednesday's second-quarter gross-domestic-product numbers showed the country's economy expanding 9.5% from a year earlier, down only slightly from the first quarter's healthy 9.7%. That hardly qualifies as a worrisome slowdown. Moreover, the headline GDP figure is misleading. On a sequential, seasonally adjusted basis, the way GDP growth is measured in most economies, GDP growth actually accelerated, rising an annualized 9.1% in the second quarter, compared with 8.7% in the first.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That the Chinese economy managed to accelerate while the rest of the world stalled is impressive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A closer look shows even more bullish signs. Industrial-production growth rebounded strongly, rising 15.1% from a year earlier in June, the highest reading since May 2010. Economists had forecast a 13.1% rise, after 13.3% in May. The increase may have been due to the easing of power shortages that had crimped production in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those still holding out for a policy loosening found some cause for hope in comments from Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao the day before the data were released. He declared that fighting inflation still is the government's top priority, but also paid lip service to slowdown fears by pledging to prevent any "large fluctuations" in economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The domestic stock market, which fixates on official pronouncements, clearly detected dovish hints in this language, rising in early morning trading even before the data were announced. In truth, it is dangerous to pay too much attention to these official statements, which are carefully crafted to appease multiple constituencies. The surprisingly strong data speak for themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key factor to watch still is inflation. The consensus among economists is that it has peaked and gradually will decline for the rest of the year. If that is the case, there may not be a need for another interest-rate increase. But forecasters have a poor record predicting Chinese inflation; nearly all of them underestimated its current severity. Volatile factors like pork shortages and weather conditions make it inherently unpredictable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China should raise rates further to tame inflation and avoid further distortions from negative real interest rates. The chances have risen that it actually might take more of the medicine it needs.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spain's Banks Will Suffer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If any doubt remained over how closely Europe's sovereign and banking crises are intertwined, the latest contagion has laid the linkages bare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares in Italian and Spanish banks have fallen as their governments' debt costs soar; many trade below post-Lehman lows. While Italy's banks are a binary bet on a solution to the Europe crisis, Spain's bank woes are more fundamental.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until Italy found itself at the center of the market storm last week, Italian banks looked relatively strong. They have raised more than 8 billion euros ($11.22 billion) of capital this year, and most have an average core Tier 1 ratio above 8%. Italian banks also have relatively low reliance on wholesale funding. Until recently, the market's biggest concern was the sector's low profitability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the loss of market confidence in the sovereign has raised fresh worries. Italian banks own government bonds equivalent to 13% of total bank assets, among the highest exposure of any major economy banking system, according to the International Monetary Fund. In contrast, Spanish banks' exposure to their own government is 6.8% of bank assets. The only bank system more exposed to its own government is Japan's, at 24% of bank assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news for Italian banks is that if the bloc of euro-using nations does succeed in addressing its sovereign-debt crisis, share prices might quickly recover. Though the turmoil in Italy partly reflects fiscal and political concerns, the biggest problem has been Germany's insistence on private-sector involvement in any fresh Greek debt deal. This has spooked investors, who fear they will be forced to take losses as a first, rather than a last, resort. A solution that avoided that would reassure bondholders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spain's banks won't escape the spotlight so easily. The market believes the sector is woefully undercapitalized and the volatility will hamper the initial public offerings of savings banks Bankia and Banca Civica, crucial for restoring confidence. Bankia looks particularly vulnerable as its IPO is constrained by the need to raise &lt;euro&gt;4 billion without diluting its parent below 50%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worse, heavy issuance of covered bonds has left Spanish banks with a shortage of collateral for future funding, according to <span class="companylink">UBS</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To ease the pressure on Spain, a far-reaching euro-zone bailout package is needed that will pave the way for greater recognition of losses and comprehensive bank recapitalization. That could take months to arrange. Until then, Spanish banks will keep suffering.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's Property-Price War</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's government needs to bring out the big guns in the war against property speculators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, 2010 China's State Council began its campaign to control sky-high house prices. Since then, however, casualties have been few. House prices have even continued to climb in some cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data from the China Real Estate Index System show that average prices for new property in June were up 5.2% year over year. Sales volume, which plummeted in the months following the clampdown, are showing signs of creeping back up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales at <span class="companylink">China Vanke</span>, the country's largest property developer by market share, jumped 79% year over year in the first half.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As developers have continued to pile up inventory, investment in residential real estate has risen 38% in the first five months of 2011 from the same period a year earlier. That suggests developers believe it is the government, rather than speculators, that ultimately will wave the white flag.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps they are right. The government talks a good game, but none of the administrative controls it has introduced have changed the basic incentives facing investors. They aren't buying property because they have an irrational love of bricks and mortar, but because, relative to the alternatives, it makes the most financial sense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An investment in property in Beijing in January 2006 would have returned 188% in the next five years, according to calculations based on China Real Estate Index System data. That compares with a 121% return for a considerably more volatile ride on the Shanghai Composite Index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Timid souls who put their cash in a five-year, fixed-term deposit would be walking away with a piddling 19% return, even less impressive considering that consumer prices rose 18% in the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is those low-interest rates on bank deposits compared with the rate of inflation that is pushing investors out of the banks and into the real-estate market. With investors shifting money, prices rise even further, creating an additional incentive to speculate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the government is serious about curbing property prices, it needs to cut off the supplies of speculative cash flowing out of the financial system into real estate. And that means raising real interest rates into positive territory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest interest-rate increase, which leaves real rates for depositors at -2%, hardly is sufficient. Data for June showed the rise in consumer prices topping 6% year over year, another incentive for investors to shift into property as a hedge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government's administrative controls might enable it to win a few battles against real-estate speculators. If it wants to win the war, the big guns of monetary policy have to come into play.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With U.S. retailers such as <span class="companylink">Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co</span>. and <span class="companylink">Gap Inc</span>. pushing into Europe, analysts are debating a key question: Has there been enough recent development to satisfy this new demand for space?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weak U.S. economy and worries about jobs have consumers spending less and are causing some of the biggest U.S. retailers to look abroad for growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to new research by property consultants <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>, 1.9 million square meters (20.5 million square feet) of new shopping-center space was built in Europe in 2010, down 36% from the previous year, even after development fell 30% in 2009. Some analysts believe there is still enough supply to satisfy demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But others aren't so sure. "A shortage of new shopping centers being built in Europe restricted the expansion plans of retailers in 2010," CBRE said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. retailers expanding abroad include some of the biggest names in the business. Banana Republic, for example, is expected to open its first French store this year. In 2010, Apple opened its largest flagship store in the world in London's Covent Garden. Fashion retailers Tommy Hilfiger and Michael Kors have built flagship stores in Paris.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other retailers on the move include Gap, which is opening stores in Europe and announced at the end of June that it would move into Africa with plans to open a Gap store in Egypt and Gap and Banana Republic stores in Morocco. Gap's moves mark a comeback after its unsuccessful attempts to establish a foothold in Europe in the 1990s; it ultimately closed all of its stores in Germany.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, <span class="companylink">Abercrombie &amp; Fitch</span> is going global with its namesake brand and its mass-market Hollister brand. In May, the fashion retailer charmed Parisians when it opened the doors of its first new flagship store on the posh Champs-Elysees, with more than 100 topless muscular male models adorning the entrance. The Paris store was the first of a series of new European openings planned over the next two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Abercrombie &amp; Fitch</span> is planning to open stores this year in Madrid, Düsseldorf and Brussels. Further openings are planned next year. Plans for Hollister are even more aggressive. The company opened 20 Hollister stores last year and intends to open an additional 40 this year, part of a plan to have as many as 185 stores in Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The impact was felt strongly in the first quarter of this year, when international sales growth outpaced U.S. sales and drove an increase in <span class="companylink">Abercrombie &amp; Fitch</span> profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if American retailers find the space they want in Europe, it is no guarantee of success. In the 1990s, U.S. retailers also tried to set up shop in Europe, but some found it difficult to deal with complicated local regulation and high rents. Also, at the time, Europe had fallen out of love with American fashion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, rents are still high, and regulation hasn't changed much. But there are signs that American duds may be back in fashion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The challenge has been to find locations. <span class="companylink">Abercrombie &amp; Fitch</span> originally intended to open 30 Hollister stores in Europe last year, but a spokesman said the company had to cut that goal by a third for administrative and organizational reasons. <span class="companylink">Abercrombie &amp; Fitch</span> put together a three-person European real-estate team last year to help with the search for space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts say the problem isn't just organization and suggest that U.S. retailers are running into a shortage of top-line retail space in Europe. "Hollister had difficulty finding locations. It appears that it is harder to find quality real estate in Europe," says Randy Konik, retail analyst with securities research firm Jeffries &amp; Co.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The outlook is better in some countries than others. According to CBRE, the development pipeline is still "considerably smaller" than in 2007 and 2008 —the most recent peak in shopping-center development. But construction starts are rising in markets such as Turkey, Russia, and Poland. There are 146 shopping centers under construction in Europe today, says CBRE, and the highest level of activity is in Europe's emerging markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The shopping center development market in Turkey has sprung back to life," Neville Moss, CBRE's head of retail research in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the shopping centers that are under construction now are projects that were put on hold during the recession. Last July, <span class="companylink">Land Securities PLC</span> got the ball rolling again when it began construction of the Trinity Leeds shopping center, the first major shopping center development in the U.K. since the recession. A <span class="companylink">Land Securities</span> spokesman said the company was willing to go ahead with the project because 40% of the space was leased in advance of construction. With the center scheduled to open in two years, about 60% of the retail space has now been leased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another thing in Europe's favor is that American retailers are finding it easier to experiment and try new strategies in new markets than to revamp worn models at home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"New concepts don't work in the U.S.," says Mr. Konik, the Jeffries analyst. "So in an effort to continue growing U.S. retailers are accelerating expansion in Europe."</p>

</div><div class="author">By A.D. Pruitt   </div><div>741 words</div><div>6 July 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate stocks again outperformed the broader stock market during the second quarter, as investors bet property companies will provide a safe haven from global turmoil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Equity All REIT Index was up 9.9% for the first half of the year, compared with a 6% rise in the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock Index and 8.6% for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, on a total return basis. The recent performance caps a two-year period in which REITs have been on a hot streak, returning nearly 30%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors have favored REITs this year in part because they assume real-estate stocks will be hurt less than other financial stocks, which have been rocked by renewed concerns about the European debt crisis. REITs also have healthy dividend yields, which have attracted a cross section of investors, including those who typically buy bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But despite the gains, some analysts say REITs are still falling short. Mike Kirby, director of research of Green Street Advisors, based in Newport Beach, Calif., says that while REITs appear to be doing well when compared with other financial stocks, they are trailing when compared with underlying real-estate values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More specifically, Green Street estimates that values for commercial real estate—shopping malls, office buildings, apartments and industrial space—are up 5% compared with five years ago, at the peak of the market. REITs, meanwhile, are down 20% when compared with five years ago, in spite of the strong gains in the past two years. That means some investors who purchased portfolios of commercial property near the market peak in 2006 have posted gains, while many investors who purchased REITs five years ago still are in the red. Considering REITs are professionally managed, the opposite should be true.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Over any extended period of time, REITs should outperform or beat real-estate prices, because they get to use leverage. They partake in value-added activities and smartly timed acquisitions," said Mr. Kirby. "It seems like the least a REIT should be able to do is to have returns that are better than passive real estate."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Green Street points out that, during the past 10 years, the percentage of REITs that beat returns on passive real estate was 48%, compared with 24% in the past five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Green Street attributes the underperformance to aggressive, but dilutive, stock sales that some REITs undertook in recent years to stave off loan defaults and bankruptcies. REITs have raised roughly $70 billion in equity over the past 2½ years to repair crisis-riddled balance sheets and build war chests for acquisitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, REITs raised $26.24 billion in equity, not including initial public offerings, the largest amount since 1997, according to data supplied by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. And that amount may soon be eclipsed; $23.72 billion has been raised so far this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although raising additional capital helped some REITs stave off financial failure, it is weighing heavily on their performances. As a result, the share prices today haven't recovered in the same way real-estate prices have recovered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Adornato, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets, acknowledges REIT prices are falling behind direct real estate. But he says some of that is out of the companies' control, because share prices are subject to the whims of the broader financial stocks sector. "Direct property owners don't have the day-to-day repricing of their assets, [and] that can mask some of the turmoil" that REITs experience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the long term, he said, "REITs as publicly traded vehicles offer substantial benefits for institutional and retail shareholders. But short-term fluctuations are to be expected," Mr. Adornato said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs were established in 1960 to give individuals a convenient way to invest in income-producing real estate. The investment vehicles, which typically focus on distinct areas of real estate, such as offices, retail properties or apartments, are required to pay at least 90% of their taxable income as dividends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regional malls were the best performing REIT sector during the first half of the year, rising 15.54%, and 8.69% in the second quarter. This sector continues to benefit from stronger retail sales and expansion by large national discount retailers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As High as $7 Billion</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Twitter Inc</span>., the fast-growing Internet messaging service, is privately raising hundreds of millions of dollars in a new financing round that values the company as high as $7 billion, said a person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move comes seven months after Twitter, which lets people broadcast and read messages called tweets, raised $200 million in a financing round led by <span class="companylink">Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers</span> that valued the company at $3.7 billion. It's unclear which investors are participating in the new round.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Twitter spokesman declined to comment on its financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some other Internet companies such as <span class="companylink">Groupon Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Zynga Inc</span>. have filed to go public, Twitter is no hurry to do the same. Instead, the company is choosing to build an experienced executive team and create an advertising business, which started last year.</p>

</div><div class="author">By A.D. Pruitt  </div><div>702 words</div><div>6 July 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C20</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate stocks again outperformed the broader stock market during the second quarter, as investors bet property companies will provide a safe haven from global turmoil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Equity All REIT Index was up 9.9% for the first half of the year, compared with a 6% rise in the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock Index and 8.6% for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, on a total return basis. The recent performance caps a two-year period in which REITs have been on a hot streak, returning nearly 30%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors have favored REITs this year in part because they assume real-estate stocks will be hurt less than other financial stocks, which have been rocked by renewed concerns about the European debt crisis. REITs also have healthy dividend yields, which have attracted a cross section of investors, including those who typically buy bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But despite the gains, some analysts say REITs are still falling short. Mike Kirby, director of research of Green Street Advisors, based in Newport Beach, Calif., says that while REITs appear to be doing well when compared with other financial stocks, they are trailing when compared with underlying real-estate values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More specifically, Green Street estimates that values for commercial real estate -- shopping malls, office buildings, apartments and industrial space -- are up 5% compared with five years ago, at the peak of the market. REITs, meanwhile, are down 20% when compared with five years ago, in spite of the strong gains in the past two years. That means some investors who purchased portfolios of commercial property near the market peak in 2006 have posted gains, while many investors who purchased REITs five years ago still are in the red. Considering REITs are professionally managed, the opposite should be true.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Over any extended period of time, REITs should outperform or beat real-estate prices, because they get to use leverage. They partake in value-added activities and smartly timed acquisitions," said Mr. Kirby. "It seems like the least a REIT should be able to do is to have returns that are better than passive real estate."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Green Street points out that, during the past 10 years, the percentage of REITs that beat returns on passive real estate was 48%, compared with 24% in the past five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Green Street attributes the underperformance to aggressive, but dilutive, stock sales that some REITs undertook in recent years to stave off loan defaults and bankruptcies. REITs have raised roughly $70 billion in equity over the past 2 1/2 years to repair crisis-riddled balance sheets and build war chests for acquisitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, REITs raised $26.24 billion in equity, not including initial public offerings, the largest amount since 1997, according to data supplied by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. And that amount may soon be eclipsed; $23.72 billion has been raised so far this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although raising additional capital helped some REITs stave off financial failure, it is weighing heavily on their performances. As a result, the share prices today haven't recovered in the same way real-estate prices have recovered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Adornato, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets, acknowledges REIT prices are falling behind direct real estate. But he says some of that is out of the companies' control, because share prices are subject to the whims of the broader financial stocks sector. "Direct property owners don't have the day-to-day repricing of their assets, [and] that can mask some of the turmoil" that REITs experience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the long term, he said, "REITs as publicly traded vehicles offer substantial benefits for institutional and retail shareholders. But short-term fluctuations are to be expected," Mr. Adornato said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regional malls were the best performing REIT sector during the first half of the year, rising 15.54%, and 8.69% in the second quarter. This sector continues to benefit from stronger retail sales and expansion by large national discount retailers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TOKYO -- <span class="companylink">Global Logistic Properties Ltd</span>., majority-owned by Singapore's sovereign-wealth fund, is in final negotiations to acquire a Japanese portfolio of real estate that could fetch up to 140 billion yen ($1.7 billion), making it the biggest property deal in Japan in two years, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private-equity firm <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span>'s real-estate arm is also in final talks and is in close competition with GLP in a bid to acquire the assets, according to the people. <span class="companylink">LaSalle Investment Management</span> is selling a portfolio of more than 20 industrial properties in Japan used for distribution and warehouses by companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The acquisition would mark the single biggest foreign investment in Japan since the country's devastating natural disasters in March. It would be the biggest single property investment since real-estate fund Secured Capital's purchase of the Pacific Century Place building in Tokyo in 2009 for 140 billion yen, according to Nomura Securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given that yields, defined as a property's expected annual net income as a percentage of its capital value, are paltry elsewhere in Asia at the moment, Japanese real estate remains an attractive destination for foreign capital, particularly given low borrowing costs. The yield on residential properties in Tokyo is between 4.5% and 5%, compared to less than 3% in Hong Kong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first half of 2010, Tokyo led all cities world-wide with real-estate transaction volume exceeding $10 billion, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>. Real-estate investment trusts and foreign investors have been active participants in the market, confident that prices have finally bottomed out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Following the March 11 earthquake, investors have marveled at the resilience of Japanese building construction and the limited damage to the vast majority of properties. Many foreign investors see now as an ideal time to invest in Japanese real estate, particularly as prices on some older, lower-grade buildings have declined following the quake.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Robert Frank   </div><div>1130 words</div><div>4 July 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>31</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the history of rapid wealth loss, Patricia Kluge stands apart. Once married to one of America's richest men, she won a divorce settlement in 1990 worth more than $100 million and proceeded to spend it on her lifestyle and business ventures. She was forced to sell off her Cartier diamonds, Givenchy gowns and silk drapes before declaring personal bankruptcy in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the Fall of the House of Kluge has been a windfall for one man: Donald Trump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Ms. Kluge's empire collapsed, Mr. Trump bought. Over the past six months, he swooped in and picked up many of the pieces of her palatial Virginia estate and winery. He bought the 405-hectare vineyard and winery for a fraction of their original value. He bought 80 hectares nearby for less than $500,000, with help from Ms. Kluge and her son.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the pompadoured billionaire and reality-TV star may have outplayed a much bigger rival in a bid for Ms. Kluge's crown jewel: her mansion. <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> owns the house after foreclosing and is trying to sell it for $16 million. The 24,000-square-foot neo-Georgian palace has 45 rooms, a spa, home theater, 3,500-bottle wine cellar and 2,000-square-foot sitting room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One thing the house doesn't have, however, is a front yard. Mr. Trump owns that, having purchased it with his 80 hectares. He also owns most of the driveway and the backyard, making a sale to any other buyer difficult. Mr. Trump said he would buy it from <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> for $3.6 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To make his point, he has erected signs on the front lawn of the mansion that read, "No Trespassing. This Land is Owned by Trump Virginia Acquisitions LLC," aimed at warding off possible buyers. He has also let the lawn go to seed. "Maybe someone is stupid enough to buy the house," Mr. Trump said. "I wish them luck."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The broker for the house, Joseph Marchetti III, responded: "We believe the house is a salable asset as it is."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mansion spat is just the latest drama to emerge from the outsize life of Patricia Kluge. Ms. Kluge, who was born in Baghdad and once posed nude for a London magazine, married John Kluge in 1981. Mr. Kluge, 34 years her senior, was named the second-richest man in America in 1986 by Forbes magazine after making billions from his Metromedia broadcasting empire. Ms. Kluge became a prominent socialite in New York, Palm Beach and Virginia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1990, the Kluges divorced. Media reported that Ms. Kluge received $1 billion, but the settlement -- which included an income stream and property -- was actually worth between $100 million and $200 million, according to people familiar with her finances. Mr. Kluge died last September at the age of 95.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the divorce, Ms. Kluge plowed much of her fortune into her grand dream: making wine in Virginia. As part of the divorce, she kept the Virginia estate -- a scenic tract of rolling hills and lakes nestled below the Blue Ridge Mountains and just down the road from Monticello, the Thomas Jefferson estate. She turned it into the Kluge Estate Winery and Vineyard. She poured more than $100 million into the property and business, say people familiar with her finances. Yet she sold only about a third of her more than 30,000 bottles a year. In 2009, she put the house up for sale -- first for $100 million, then $48 million and finally $24 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, which had a mortgage of $22.8 million on the mansion, foreclosed in February. Mr. Trump bid $3.6 million for the house at the foreclosure auction. Yet <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> bought the home back for $15.3 million. (It isn't uncommon for banks to buy back their foreclosed properties at auction). The bank said its bid was in line with the appraisal for the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trump, however, had quietly cut a side deal that would frustrate the bank's plans. He and the Kluges had been friends for more than 30 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Ms. Kluge ran out of money, she went to Mr. Trump's office asking for a rescue. Mr. Trump saw the potential for a kind of Virginia Mar-a-Lago, with a golf club and guest rooms, built around a vineyard instead of Palm Beach. Ms. Kluge's interest was in keeping the house, land and vineyard together and staying involved in the winery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the February foreclosure, Mr. Trump paid $500,000 for about 80 hectares around the house. The property included most of the front yard, most of the driveway and a large chunk of the back yard. The deal also included a right of first refusal on the mansion, meaning that Mr. Trump had the right to match the offer of any other would-be buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seller of the 80 hectares was a Kluge-family trust created for John Kluge II, John's son. People familiar with the trust say John Sr. split off the front yard, driveway and right of first refusal from the house to benefit his son and to prevent his ex-wife from selling the house without permission from his son's trust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Mr. Trump began scooping up the other pieces of the estate. The vineyard had been taken over by <span class="companylink">Farm Credit of the Virginias ACA</span>, which had a $34.8 million lien on the business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trump says he offered the bank $21 million in cash, but the bank declined. An attorney for Farm Credit says Mr. Trump refused to put the offer in writing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, the vineyard went on the auction block, and Mr. Trump won the bidding for most of the vineyard for $6.2 million -- far less than the $60 million that banks and lenders had once valued the business and property. He paid an additional $1.7 million for equipment and inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trump's son Eric is now running the vineyard with assistance from Ms. Kluge. In a statement, Ms. Kluge said she is "thrilled at having a second chance to fulfill my dream."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Marchetti says he has had expressions of strong interest in the house from prospective buyers. Even after Mr. Trump's purchase, the house has about 40 hectares, as well as access rights to the driveway. Mr. Trump's front yard has a conservation easement, meaning he can't easily build in front of the mansion. As for the Trump signs, Mr. Marchetti says buyers hardly notice.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It isn't enough simply to sign a bunch of papers establishing an estate plan and other end-of-life instructions. You also have to make your heirs aware of them and leave the documents where they can find them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider: At least 10 states have been investigating whether some of the country's largest insurers are failing to pay out unclaimed life policies to beneficiaries. California and Florida have held public hearings on the issue in recent weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insurers say they are behaving lawfully. Under policy contracts, they aren't required to take steps to determine if a policyholder is still alive, but instead pay a claim when beneficiaries come forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can avoid such problems by securing important documents and telling your family where they are stored.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jean Parr is grateful that her mother obsessed about the subject. "I really didn't want to think about it," says Ms. Parr, 54 years old, a manager at the American Chemical Society in Washington. But when her mom died in 2005, she knew exactly where to look for the will, the key to a safe-deposit box and documents indicating her mother had paid and arranged for her own funeral.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The financial consequences of failing to keep your documents in order can be significant. According to the National Association of Unclaimed Property Administrators, state treasurers currently hold $32.9 billion in unclaimed bank accounts and other assets. (You can search for unclaimed assets at MissingMoney.com.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most experts recommend creating a comprehensive folder of documents that family members can access in case of an emergency, so they aren't left scrambling to find and organize a hodgepodge of disparate bank accounts, insurance policies and brokerage accounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can store the documents with your attorney, lock them away in a safe-deposit box or keep them at home in a fireproof safe that someone else knows the combination to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That isn't to say you should keep everything. Sometimes people hold onto so many papers that loved ones can't find the important ones easily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, Jane Bissler, a counselor in Kent, Ohio, approached her then-87-year-old mother about organizing her documents. Because her mom was a widow with relatively simple finances and two homes, Ms. Bissler, 57, says she figured it would be a relatively simple task.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, it took an entire year for Ms. Bissler and her mother to go through all of her papers, which included documents from eight bank accounts, utility bills from the 1950s and reams of canceled checks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two of them pared down the stash from four four-drawer filing cabinets to one two-drawer cabinet, shredding anything extraneous. Ms. Bissler and her mother visited banks and brokerages to ensure she was listed on all of her mother's accounts. Her mother died in May 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It would have been a total nightmare if we hadn't gone through it all with her," Ms. Bissler says. "It was that Depression-era stuff where you keep everything and hide other things." Ms. Bissler estimates that having the documents organized ahead of time spared them from ordering an additional 15 copies of the death certificate and "years" of time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here is a rundown of the most important documents you'll need to have signed, sealed and delivered. You should start collecting these as soon as possible and update them every few years to reflect changes in assets and preferences. Some -- such as copies of tax returns or recent child-support payments -- need to be updated more often than others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Essentials</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An original will is the most important document to keep on file.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A will allows you to dictate who inherits your assets and, if your children are underage, their guardians. Dying without a will means losing control of how your assets are distributed. Instead, state law will determine what happens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wills are subject to probate -- legal proceedings that take inventory, make appraisals of property, settle outstanding debt and distribute remaining assets. Not having an original document means this already onerous process could be much more of an ordeal, since family members can challenge a copy of a will in court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rick Law, founder of estate-planning firm Law ElderLaw LLP in Aurora, Ill., says estate planners increasingly recommend revocable trusts in addition to wills, since they are more private and harder to dispute. "Every will is like a compass that points toward the closest courthouse," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A revocable living trust can be changed anytime during your lifetime. After you transfer ownership of various assets to the trust, you can serve as the trustee on behalf of beneficiaries you designate. Provided you do so, there aren't any ongoing fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If your family can't find the original trust documents, you are "basically setting your estate up for litigation," says Duncan Moseley, vice president of Sanders Financial Management in Atlanta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A "letter of instruction" can be a useful supplement to a will, though it doesn't hold legal weight. It is a good way to make sure your executor has the names and contact information of your attorneys, accountants and financial advisers. While the will should be stored with your attorney or in a courthouse, the letter of instruction should be more readily accessible, particularly if it contains instructions on funeral arrangements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, make sure your heirs have access to a durable financial power-of-attorney form. Without it, no one can make financial decisions on your behalf in the event that you are incapacitated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Proof of Ownership</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You should keep documentation of housing and land ownership, cemetery plots, vehicles, stock certificates and savings bonds; any partnership or corporate operating agreements; and a list of brokerage and escrow mortgage accounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you don't tell your family that you own such assets, there is a chance they never will find out. Mr. Moseley says in such an event, clients must perform their own detective work, watching the mail for real-estate tax bills or combing bank accounts for interest payments, for example.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">File any documents that list loans you have made to others, since they could be included as assets in an estate. Similarly, keep a list of any debts you owe to avoid surprising your family. Wills and living trusts generally are drafted to include provisions for how debts should be settled, and creditors have a stipulated period of time in which to file a claim against the estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Make the most recent three years of tax returns available, too. "Looking at last year's returns offers a snapshot of what assets we should be looking for this year," says Lesley Moss Mamdouhi, a principal at estate-law firm Oram &amp; Moss in Chevy Chase, Md. This also will help your personal representative file a final income-tax and estate return and, if necessary, a revocable-trust return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank Accounts</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Law recommends sharing a list of all accounts and online log-in information with your family so they can notify the bank of your death. "If nobody ever takes any more out or puts money in, it becomes a dormant account and then becomes the property of the state," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Be sure to list any safe-deposit boxes you own, register your spouse or child's name with the bank and ask them to sign the registration document so they can have access without securing a court order.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Health-Care Confidential</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Possibly the most important health-care document to fill out in advance is a durable health-care power-of-attorney form. This allows your designee to make health-care decisions on your behalf if you are incapacitated. The document should be compliant with federal health-information privacy laws, so that doctors, hospitals and insurance companies can speak with your designee. You may also need to fill out an Authorization to Release Protected Healthcare Information form.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you are incapacitated and your family can't locate a health-care power of attorney, they will have to go to court to get a guardian appointed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Porter Storey, executive vice president of the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine in Glenview, Ill., says it isn't enough to establish a health-care power of attorney unless you have explained to your designee how you would like to be treated in case of incapacity. He also recommends writing a living will detailing your wishes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Diane Dimond's mother had a series of strokes in 2006, Ms. Dimond knew there was a signed living will tucked away in a safe at home. Ms. Dimond, 58 and living in New York, recalls the Sunday she watched her mother in a coma and was able to fulfill her wishes never to be kept on external life support. "It was gut-wrenching," she says, "but I took the physician aside and said, 'I want to take her home.'" Having her mother's living will enabled Ms. Dimond to do just that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The living will and the power of attorney constitute what are called "advance directives"; some states consolidate these into a single form. (AARP offers a state-by-state listing of advance-directive forms on its website.) Terminally ill patients may wish to have their doctors sign a do-not-resuscitate order.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certain companies, such as Advance Choice Inc.'s DocuBank, will keep copies of health-care documents for a fee. Subscribers get a wallet-sized card and, in case of an emergency, a hospital will call DocuBank, which will fax over the information.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Life Insurance and Retirement Accounts</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Copies of life-insurance policies are among the most important documents for your family to have. Family members need to know the name of the carrier, the policy number and the agent associated with the policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Be especially careful with life-insurance policies granted by an employer upon your retirement, since those are the kind that financial planners most often miss, says David Peterson, CEO of Denver-based Peak <span class="companylink">Capital Investment Services</span>. New York state alone is holding more than $400 million in life-insurance-related payments that have gone unclaimed since 2000, according to the state comptroller's office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Estate planners also recommend that you draw up a list of pensions, annuities, individual retirement accounts and 401(k)s for your spouse and children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An IRA is considered dormant or unclaimed if no withdrawal has been made by age 70 1/2. According to the National Association of Unclaimed Property Administrators, tens of millions of dollars languish in unclaimed IRAs every year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If your heirs don't know about these accounts, they won't be able to lay claim to them, and the money could languish. The U.S. Department of Labor estimates that each year tens of thousands of workers fail to claim or roll over $850 million in 401(k) assets. You can track unclaimed pensions, 401(k)s and IRAs at Unclaimed.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marriage and Divorce</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ensure your spouse knows where you have stored your marriage license. Mary Cay Corr, now 74 and living in Raleigh-Durham, N.C., couldn't locate hers when her husband died. "I had to write to New York, where we got married, and pay for a new marriage license to prove that I had been married to my husband before I could claim anything," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For divorced people, it is important to leave behind the divorce judgment and decree or, if the case was settled without going to court, the stipulation agreement, says Linda Lea Viken, president of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers in Chicago. These documents lay out child support, alimony and property settlements, and also may list the division of investment and retirement accounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Include the distribution sheet listing bank-account numbers that accompanied the settlement to avoid disputes about ownership or payments due. Also include a copy of the most recent child-support payment order. In the majority of states, the obligation to pay child support still exists after death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Viken also recommends filing copies of any life-insurance papers. In many states if you have a policy that benefits your children, it can be set off against the ongoing child support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You also should include a copy of the "qualified domestic-relations order," which can prove your spouse received a share of your retirement accounts.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—The number of people who signed contracts to buy previously occupied homes in the U.S. rose last month, but was still low from a historical perspective, as the housing market remained a weak sector of the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors' seasonally adjusted index for pending sales of existing homes increased 8.2% on a monthly basis to a reading of 88.8, the industry group said Wednesday. It was the strongest monthly gain since last November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had expected pending home sales would rise by 10.0% in May from an original April reading of 81.9. That month's reading was revised up to 82.1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pending sales index for May was 13.4% above its level in May 2010, a month in which sales fell dramatically after the expiration of a federal tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This solid gain in contract signings implies that home values in many localities are or will soon be stabilizing as inventories get absorbed at a faster pace," said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, many economists caution that the housing market is a troublesome part of the economy. Foreclosures continue to depress home values and sales levels remain historically weak. Many housing markets face a backlog of foreclosed houses that have been delayed by banks' difficulty processing paperwork used to seize properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices were up 0.7% in April when compared with March, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller 20-city index, a measure of home prices in large metropolitan areas. But after accounting for a typical pickup in prices at the start of the spring buying season, home prices were almost unchanged from March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pending-sales index tracks agreements to purchase homes and is based on pending sales of existing homes, including single-family homes and condominiums. A reading of 100 refers to the level of sales in 2001.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sale is considered pending when the contract has been signed, but the transaction hasn't closed. Pending sales typically close within one or two months of signing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index was up 12.9% in the West on a monthly basis and 10.5% in the Midwest. It rose 7.3% in the Northeast and 4.1% in the South.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Bob Davis  </div><div>766 words</div><div>27 June 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEIJING -- A recent decline in Chinese real-estate prices is starting to shake confidence in the country's economic vitality and open a debate about whether the country's economy is over-leveraged. That's what made the real-estate bubble's aftermath so painful for the U.S. and Japan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just two months ago, China expert Nicholas Lardy dismissed concerns about what he labeled a "so-called property bubble" during a conference at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, he says a housing downturn could produce a "major, major economic correction" in China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What changed? A growing realization that much of China's massive stimulus spending and lending of 2009 and 2010 ended up in land purchases, driving up prices in an unsustainable fashion. And a recognition that the Chinese economic system routinely produces bubbles and is unlikely to change any time soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government keeps bank deposit rates well below the rate of inflation to benefit state-owned banks and other firms, which have the political power to defend the status quo. With few financial alternatives to beat inflation, Chinese savers buy real estate, even if supply soars ahead of demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the next three to five years, says <span class="companylink">UBS</span> economist Wang Tao, prices are bound to head sharply upward again because of the paucity of alternative investments for Chinese savers and the reliance of local governments on land sales for revenue. At some point, she figures, the boom could give way to a bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lardy expects the cycle to play out more quickly. A number of events could trigger a big selloff, including a sharp rise in interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Estimates of how badly the economy could be damaged by a real-estate slump reflect different views of the structure of the Chinese economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strength of the real-estate market directly affects the construction, steel, concrete, power and appliance industries. In all, about 50% of China's GDP is linked to the fate of its real-estate market, says Standard Chartered economist Stephen Green.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Green said a downturn wouldn't be as devastating as the burst bubbles in the U.S. and Japan. In those cases, falling real-estate prices caused bad debt to mushroom and cripple the banking industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, in China, far fewer consumers use debt to buy homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other analysts say there are many more leveraged purchases of real estate than recognized in the official statistics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To fight the global downturn, Chinese state-owned banks loaned about $3 trillion mostly to giant state-owned enterprises. The money was reported to have largely financed infrastructure projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many of the loans wound up financing real-estate purchases instead, said Deng Yongheng, director of the Institute of Real Estate Studies at the National University of Singapore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices at auctions for residential land in eight major cities doubled in 2009 largely because of highly leveraged purchases by state-owned companies, he and three co-authors calculate. In March 2010, state-owned companies bid up the price of one piece of Beijing land to 10 times the asking price, according to one analyst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The magnitude of the leveraged purchases is hard to gauge. One indication: Shortly after the Beijing land sale, the Chinese agency that oversees state-owned companies, ordered 78 firms -- whose charters had nothing to do with real estate -- to cease buying and selling property. Nearly a year later, in February 2011, state-owned Xinhua news agency reported that just 14 firms had left the business and another 20 were expected to get out later in the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for the agency said that the firms needed time to finish their projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past year, Beijing has put in place measures to temper real-estate sales, including raising the minimum downpayment for mortgages on second homes to 60% and enacting China's first property tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But few expect the anti-bubble measures to last, given concern by the government and Communist Party about sustaining growth, which they see as a key to social stability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charlene Chu, a Fitch Ratings Service analyst in Beijing, said state-owned firms have taken on heavy real-estate debt. Thus a sharp fall in prices would produce a raft of nonperforming loans and "would have an outsized impact on Chinese banks."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, a real-estate collapse could lead to a banking crisis -- the kind of woes that have undermined the U.S. and Japan.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale of a large West Village apartment building sparked a lawsuit by a spurned bidder, highlighting the intensifying competition among investors for prime Manhattan residential properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A venture including Belvedere Capital Real Estate Partners and <span class="companylink">Angelo Gordon &amp; Co</span>. is paying about $70 million for the Printing House at 421 Hudson St., beating out more than 25 potential buyers. The building, which once housed printers, was converted to condominiums 30 years ago. But 105 of the units are operated as rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal raised the ire of another big-name investment firm, <span class="companylink">Taconic Investment Partners</span>. Taconic, which was a finalist in the bidding, has filed a lawsuit in New York state court against the seller, Mountbatten Equities, alleging that the firm "cynically and duplicitously" used Taconic as a "stalking horse" bidder to increase the sale price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mountbatten's "failure to negotiate in good faith was the only impediment to consummating the transaction" with Taconic, the firm's complaint states. The complaint asks the seller for $4.4 million in damages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alan Gordon, a lawyer representing Mountbatten, denied the seller did anything wrong. He said that Mountbatten negotiated in good faith with Taconic and simply took a more attractive late offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Taconic was the principal party and remained the principal party until the very end. There was never any intention on behalf of the partnership that owns 421 Hudson Street to exploit them in any fashion," Mr. Gordon said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawsuits of this type aren't unusual in a rising market. According to Taconic's court papers, the firm agreed to pay $77.25 million for the units, which appears to be more than the winning bidder's offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mountbatten chose the Belvedere-Angelo Gordon group because, under its bid, Mountbatten will retain an undisclosed share in the property's future profits and a role in managing the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While most the country's housing market is languishing, Manhattan residential property is hot among investors looking for opportunities to upgrade apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the case of the Printing House, the Belvedere and <span class="companylink">Angelo Gordon</span> venture, which also includes apartment developer Myles Horn of MJH Birchwood, is planning to vacate the rental units, renovate them and sell them as condos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Angelo Gordon</span>, Belvedere and Taconic have all been active players as the New York real estate market has recovered from the downturn. Taconic is best known for its upgrade of 111 Eighth Ave., the enormous office building 15 blocks to the north of the Printing House that <span class="companylink">Google Inc</span>. acquired late last year for $1.9 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Belvedere and <span class="companylink">Angelo Gordon</span>, meantime, played a major role in the redevelopment of the Chelsea Market as a specialty-food destination and media Mecca.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mountbatten, which is owned by Winthrop Chamberlin and Barnet Liberman, bought the turn-of-the-last-century industrial building across from James J. Walker Park in 1975 for about $550,000. It was one of the first commercial-to-residential conversions in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seeing the residential market heat up in late 2010, Mountbatten put the property on the market through <span class="companylink">Grubb &amp; Ellis Co</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Taconic's complaint, the firm began talks with Mountbatten in November 2010 and the parties exchanged drafts of the contract and "toasted to closing the deal together" in December. Taconic agreed to pay $77.25 million for the units, the documents say, and the deal was set to close at the end of January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the sellers delayed the deal, according to Taconic's compliant. They said they needed approval from the building's condo board to move forward but when a meeting of the condo board was held in April, Messrs. Liberman and Chamberlin, both members of the board, "refused to participate," the complaint states. Their lawyer said the sellers didn't attend the condo board meeting because of a conflict of interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Belvedere and <span class="companylink">Angelo Gordon</span> executives say they began meeting with Mountbatten about the Printing House in early spring of this year. They said they struck a deal in which the new owners would pay about $70 million but keep Messrs. Chamberlin and Liberman involved as day-to-day managers of the property and profit participants. "We had to move quickly to take the deal," said Glen Siegel, founder of Belvedere, in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Printing House will be one of the more significant luxury residential projects since the recession, combining a coveted location, rare architectural features such as 15-foot ceilings in the units and a recently opened 30,000-square-foot Equinox fitness facility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developers nonetheless face a huge task transforming the 30-year-old residential conversion into luxury condos. They'll first need to vacate tenants over time and then fix the common areas, including a barren courtyard, renovating and possibly combining some of the individual units, which currently start at 750 square feet for one-bedrooms. They've hired Corcoran Sunshine to market the property and will select an architect shortly.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state Legislature Friday evening passed a sprawling piece of legislation that extends the city's rent regulations and places a property tax cap on towns and cities outside of New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The catch-all legislation delivers for Democrats the first notable, if modest, expansion of the city's rent regulations since landlord-friendly provisions were put into place nearly two decades ago. At the same time, the bill, made public just a few hours before a vote, follows through on Republicans promises of a tax cap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also contained the extension of an expired tax break for residential developers that had long been pushed by the real estate industry. Further, the bill's text contained an unexpected extension—pushed by the real estate industry—of a tax break for stalled residential developments projects that were slated to lose some benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The omnibus nature of the legislation was by design: Assembly Democrats had pushed to tie up Republican-favored issues such as the tax cap and the real estate tax break in an attempt to gain leverage in negotiations on the rent laws. In the end, neither advocates of more expansive rent regulations nor real estate executives won what they had been hoping, as the final legislation followed the bounds of a compromise outline pushed by Mr. Cuomo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four-year rent regulation bill would slow the pace of deregulation by increasing the minimum monthly rent under which a landlord can convert a rent-stabilized apartment to market rates. That monthly rent is moved to $2,500, from $2,000. While the increase received resistance from landlords, they successfully pushed to keep it as a flat rate, not tied to inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also on Friday, the Assembly unanimously passed a bill designed to make it harder for the Legislature and governor to use money meant for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to fill budget holes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As they've scrambled to find ways to balance the budget in recent years, lawmakers and the governor have sometimes diverted receipts from taxes that are supposed to be dedicated to paying for the MTA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The legislation, which the Senate also passed unanimously earlier in the week, seeks to curb that practice by prohibiting the governor from diverting funds and requiring the legislature to make public what the impact on service will be if it does the same.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mass-transit advocates including the MTA's biggest union, pushed for the bill's passage, dubbing it a "lockbox" for MTA funds. But the lock isn't particularly strong since the Legislature can change the law when it passes budget bills. Nearly all of the diversions from the MTA's dedicated funds were done with legislation, not by the governor acting alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cuomo hasn't indicated whether he'll sign the bill, but its unanimous passage in both houses of the Legislature makes it appear unlikely that a veto could be sustained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also Friday, the Senate passed a bill allowing New York City to let as many as 30,000 livery cabs pick up passengers who hail them on the street everywhere except Manhattan south of Harlem and at the airports. The bill's passage is a win for Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who proposed the plan to improve taxi service outside Manhattan in January. Mr. Bloomberg's Taxi and Limousine Commissioner, David Yassky, has negotiated for months with different parts of the fractious industry to try to find a compromise before settling on the current version last weekend. The Assembly passed the plan earlier this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bill was vigorously opposed by owners of the city's 13,000 yellow taxi medallion, who see the plan as an erosion of their exclusive right to pick up passengers who hail them on the street—a privilege that now costs nearly $1 million per taxi. But city data show that those cabs almost never pick up outside of Manhattan and at the airports. The group that represents the city's yellow-taxi fleet owners said it would upend the industry and threatened to sue if Mr. Cuomo signs the bill into law. He hasn't indicated whether or not he will.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Mr. Cuomo signs the bill, livery drivers will be able to buy the right to pick up passengers who hail them on the street for $1,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They'll have to put credit card readers and meters in their cars and charge the same 50-cent-per-ride tax for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority that yellow cabs must charge. The bill would also let the city sell 1,500 new yellow taxi medallions.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OTTAWA -- Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of Canada, has chosen his weapons in a battle against a problem all too familiar to many Americans -- a housing boom marked by rising debt and frothy real-estate prices in some markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Carney, like central bankers in other places fighting real-estate booms, is leaning on tougher regulations for banks and home buyers, rather than on higher interest rates, to prevent Canada's rising housing prices from going too far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You don't turn to monetary policy first," Mr. Carney said in an exclusive interview with The Wall Street Journal. "The principle is that there are other tools that are the best tools to address the risk of excesses developing in housing, and they should be deployed first. In Canada, we have deployed those other tools. As a consequence, we expect moderation in housing activity."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian Real Estate Association estimates the national average price of homes sold in May was 376,817 Canadian dollars, or about US$384,510, up 8.6% year-to-year. That is being pushed up in part by historically high sales prices in exclusive Vancouver neighborhoods, and broad-based gains in Toronto. But prices excluding Vancouver were still up 5.6% year-to-year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average home price in Vancouver in May, meanwhile, was C$831,555, which was a 25.7% jump from May 2010. In Toronto, prices were up 8.7% to C$446,593.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Carney has been trying to draw attention to excesses building up in housing, a trend that has emerged in Canada just four years after a historic housing bust in the U.S. In a speech in Vancouver earlier this month, the central banker called the city an "extreme example" of potential problems building elsewhere in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Central bankers world-wide have been debating for years how to respond to the threat posed by potential asset bubbles. Before the U.S. housing bust, many Federal Reserve officials felt the central bank shouldn't try to address bubbles. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has acknowledged that the Fed failed to adequately regulate banks during the housing boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists also blame the Fed for failing to push interest rates higher in the last decade to slow the run-up in building and residential real-estate prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many other markets today -- including China, Hong Kong and Israel -- central banks and bank regulators are turning to regulatory tools to prevent home prices booms from turning into outright bubbles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That is a major shift from five years ago," said Martin Barnes, chief economist at Bank Credit Analyst, a Toronto-based research service. "They have at least acknowledged that they can no longer ignore asset bubbles."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists still don't agree on whether higher interest rates should also be used to stop bubbles. Many central bankers see them as a last resort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Carney said regulatory tools, including tougher mortgage-insurance requirements imposed by Canadian regulators on borrowers and higher capital standards being imposed on banks, were starting to bite. Higher short-term interest rates could be a weapon against excessive housing prices, he said, but are not the first or primary option.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Carney is in a tricky spot. Even as home prices rise in Canada, the country has been buffeted by what the central bank chief described as "considerable head winds" from abroad, including a slowdown in U.S. economic growth and a strong Canadian dollar, which is hurting exports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That could mean that interest rates will stay low for a while longer. Last year, the central bank increased the benchmark overnight interest rate to 1% from 0.25%. Mr. Carney has warned that rates won't remain this low forever. But he suggested he isn't in a rush to raise them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In an environment of substantial head winds," Mr. Carney said, "monetary policy may still need to be stimulative in order to close the output gap and in order to get inflation back to target."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central bank will update its economic forecasts in its quarterly monetary policy report next month. It has been projecting that by mid-2012 the Canadian economy will be back to its full capacity.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(See Corrections &amp; Amplifications item below.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An investment group has made a profit of about $100 million by reselling the former downtown headquarters of insurer <span class="companylink">American International Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The venture, which included <span class="companylink">Kumho Investment Bank</span>, of South Korea, had purchased the 66-story tower at 70 Pine St. and 72 Wall St. in 2009 for $150 million. Kumho has now signed a contract to sell 70 Pine to Metro Loft, a developer of luxury rental property, for $205 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Metro's principals, Ronny Bruckner and Nathan Berman, say they plan to convert the former AIG headquarters, that was just designated a landmark by the city, to about 1,100 luxury rental units. They hope to begin marketing units by the fall of 2012 and studios will start at around $2,300 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've been after this building since before AIG was forced to put it on the block," Mr. Berman said in an interview Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal is the latest sign of the sharp rise of some Manhattan properties since the depth of the downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rental apartment buildings also are hot and other developers are also cashing in on the downtown luxury market. Residential buildings in the area that sat empty through much of the downturn are now finding tenants in many cases, according to brokers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kumho originally teamed up in 2009 with Young Woo, a Korean-born investor in New York real estate, and purchased 70 Pine as well as 72 Wall St. from AIG. They paid a total price of $150 million for the two properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Korean venture planned to develop modern office space and condos but never moved forward. Kumho played the lead role in the recent sale. It's not clear how much Mr. Woo is still involved in the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new owners plan to invest substantial money in gut renovating and converting the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For us, this is an area with the highest density in New York, the youngest demographic and an area with the best transportation in New York," said Mr. Berman. "It's also the closest to all of the exciting downtown neighborhoods, like TriBeCa, Meatpacking and the Lower East Side."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> team of Richard Baxter, Ron Cohen, Scott Latham and Jon Caplan arranged the deal, but all declined or couldn't be reached for comment. Mr. Woo didn't respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyer of <span class="companylink">American International Group</span>'s former headquarters building at 70 Pine St. plans to convert it into rental apartments, which it will begin marketing at about $2,300 a month for a studio.

</div><div class="author">By Mia Lamar                And Dawn Wotapka   </div><div>351 words</div><div>24 June 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK—<span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>.'s fiscal second-quarter profit fell 65% as home deliveries fell and orders came in flat, though the home builder still exceeded expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has been a trouble spot in the U.S. economic recovery, as high supply and foreclosures have weighed on home prices. Sales of new homes have been particularly sluggish, remaining near record-low levels in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Lennar has helped itself by looking outside of home building. Its Rialto division, which invests in distressed real estate, has been a driving force behind the Miami-based company's return to profitability. It expects a profitable year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Despite operating in a challenging housing market that saw very little evidence of a spring selling season, we were still able to achieve strong results, making this our fifth consecutive quarter of profitability," Chief Executive Stuart Miller said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the quarter ended May 31, Lennar reported a profit of $13.8 million, or seven cents a share, down from a $39.7 million, or 21 cents a share, a year ago. The year-earlier period included a six-cent-a-share income-tax benefit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue fell 6.1% to $764.5 million. Revenue from home sales fell 6.5%, to $648.8 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters most recently forecast earnings of four cents a share on $646 million in sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gross margin on home sales slipped to 19.4% from 20.6%, making it among the sector's top performers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders were flat from a year ago at 3,204 homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home deliveries fell 7.9% to 2,682 homes, from 2,912 homes last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company's backlog, an indication of future business, edged down 1%, while the cancellation rate was 17%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lennar "turned in results about as good as we could expect during this slowing housing environment," Stephen East, an analyst with Ticonderoga Securities, wrote in a client note.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of people filing new claims for unemployment insurance ticked up last week in the latest sign that the U.S. labor market is sputtering amid slower economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial claims for unemployment insurance increased 9,000 to 429,000 in the week ended June 18, the Labor Department said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four-week moving average of claims, which smooths out weekly gyrations, was 426,250. That was the 11th consecutive week that claims were above the crucial 400,000 mark. Economists generally believe that below that level employers are adding more jobs than they are shedding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The labor market continues to crawl along," said Jacob Oubina, an economist at <span class="companylink">RBC Capital Markets</span> in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The jobless claims, along with other lackluster labor indicators, have convinced many economists -- including Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke -- that U.S. employment growth is stalling. Mr. Bernanke cited weak claims data, among other indicators, in a news conference Wednesday, following the Fed's decision to leave interest rates at essentially zero.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We project unemployment to come down very painfully slowly," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The initial-claims data measure people filing first-time applications for unemployment insurance. The weekly rise suggests more employers are letting workers go, but also indicates slow hiring, meaning laid-off workers are having a hard time finding new positions without a spell of joblessness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most recent claims data were collected the same week that the Labor Department gathers employment information for its monthly snapshot of the U.S. jobs picture, which could presage a glum report to be released early in July. The last monthly report, issued in early June, showed employers added an anemic 54,000 jobs in May, compared with an average of 180,000 a month in the first four months of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lately, some of the hardest-hit sectors have been state and local government jobs as well as areas that rely on government money. Several states, for instance, reported layoffs in the health-care and social-assistance sector, which has been squeezed by state reductions in Medicaid payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. gross domestic product expanded at a 1.8% annual pace in the first quarter of 2011, compared with 3.1% rate in the final three months of 2010. That slowdown almost certainly has continued: Based on disappointing economic data, St. Louis forecasting firm <span class="companylink">Macroeconomic Advisers</span> predicts 2.0% GDP growth for the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another report Thursday, the Chicago Federal Reserve's National Activity Index, which is an average of 85 economic indicators that aims to predict GDP growth, saw its three-month average decline in May from April, consistent with slowing GDP expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Commerce Department said Thursday sales of new homes fell 2.1% in May, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 319,000. The drop followed big increases in March and April, yet came in a month typically popular for home buying.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHILADELPHIA -- The housing slump has reined in Americans' once-insatiable appetite for bigger and better homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, real estate's growth and survival depended on buyers trading up to more-expensive properties. Now, faced with economic uncertainty, tighter lending and the inability to sell existing properties, homeowners are hunkering down, foregoing dreams of dens and great rooms, fourth bedrooms and second staircases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend can be seen in the latest report on sales of existing, or previously owned, homes for May, released Tuesday by the National Association of Realtors. Overall, the report showed that sales of existing homes fell 3.8% in May, underscoring the weakness of the spring selling season and the uneven nature of the housing recovery. The national median existing-home price was $166,500 in May, down 4.6% from May 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the report also showed that the market is bifurcating. Sales of homes under $100,000 were up 6.7% nationwide in May, compared with a year earlier, led by a 58% gain in the West. Meanwhile, sales of homes priced between $100,00 and $500,000 -- which represents the vast middle tier of the market -- declined nearly 19%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The middle tier of the housing market has been more troubled because homeowners in that category are often burdened with more debt and are deeper underwater on their mortgages than people on the bottom or the top of the economic ladder. "What negative equity has done to the market is to gum up the conveyor belt that has worked pretty well," said Stan Humphries, chief economist for real estate portal <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span>. "People can't move up a rung because they can't get out, or they don't want to."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, the squeeze on the middle market varies by region. Sales volume for homes priced between $500,000 and $750,000 in the Midwest posted a 1% increase in May, compared with a year earlier, for example. Median prices in Houston, Miami, San Antonio and Washington, D.C., were all up in May, compared with a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many ways, Philadelphia exemplifies the broader demographic shifts affecting real estate nationwide. Baby boomers are downsizing, often selling homes in the suburbs to move back into cities. Price declines in the suburbs have been steeper than in the city. Multimillion-dollar luxury properties, meanwhile, appear more insulated and continue their rise. Sellers who price aggressively tend to find buyers much faster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But not all are willing. In Bucks County, Pa., Vijay Raju's five-bedroom, five-bathroom home has lingered on the market for 18 months. He listed it for $849,900 -- a price he wouldn't budge on because he put so much work into the property. He said he knows the price is high, but "I didn't want to lose money." by selling at a loss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About four miles away, Joanna Kot's four-bedroom, two-bathroom on a block of Cape Cod homes sold within two weeks. With an eye on moving into a newer, bigger house, Ms. Kot priced aggressively -- at $199,000. "We put the price down a little because we were worried we wouldn't be able to sell," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The route between Mr. Raju's house and Ms. Kot's winds past at least 10 others for sale, reflecting the county's 11-month supply of homes, according to one real-estate agent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The high end is largely exempt from the vagaries of the market. For one, it represents a small fraction of sales, and purchasers tend to be all-cash buyers. In Philadelphia, the sale of a 4,250-square-foot penthouse hit a record last year when it sold for $12.5 million. Among the building's host of luxury amenities, 1706 Rittenhouse Square boasts an automated "parking system the Jetsons would love," according to a recent headline in the Philadelphia Business Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our projects are aimed at the tiny top sliver of the market," says developer Tom Scannapieco. "The people in this price range are not feeling the pain of this economic slowdown."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the trade-up buyers -- families that once might have bought a bigger home -- are staying put and trying to do make do with what they have. Luke Chechla, a partner with KLM Contractors, describes clients as "very careful."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Years ago, they would not only move but improve the quality of the home right away," he said. "Five years ago, if someone had a small leak in the roof, it was, 'How much for a new roof?' Now it's 'Can you fix this without replacing the whole roof?"'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a sign of the times, Mr. Chechla has begun working with a European supplier of moveable walls. He reasons that if people can't buy a house with more rooms, they can at least divide existing space to create them.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real-estate industry's growth and survival depend on buyers trading up to more-expensive properties.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The grand 40-acre estate in Greenwich, Conn., that once belonged to Leona Helmsley is back on the market for $42.9 million, less than a year after the current owner bought it for $35 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The estate's sale last year was one of the most expensive ever in this affluent New York suburb. It created a stir because it was marked down substantially from the Helmsley estate's initial asking price of $125 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property includes a carriage house, walk-in vault and koi pond. While it lacks beachfront access, it has hilltop views of Long Island Sound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers familiar with the estate say the current owner purchased the property through an attorney, so the person's identity isn't publicly known.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers were taken aback that the property, purchased in October, was already up for sale, and said it was unlikely the owner had moved in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is a big surprise," said Barbara Wells, a sales agent with Prudential Connecticut Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The listing by Jane Basham of David Oglivy &amp; Associates says that the formal rooms have been "restored to the original oak paneling." In an email, Ms. Basham added that work on the bathrooms and kitchens "have brought it to 2011 ideas of taste by removing all earlier incursions on the wonderful original architecture."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mansion, also known as Dunnellen Hall, has 28 rooms, including a reception hall with an 86-foot-long gallery, a master suite and a wine cellar with tasting room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new listing comes amid signs that the Greenwich market may be gathering some steam after prices fell by about 25% from the market's peak, Ms. Wells said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers also are watching another big listing: 84-80 Field Point Circle on the Greenwich waterfront.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, the century-old estate—with an indoor and outdoor pool, a 35-foot-tall atrium and its own suspension bridge—went into contract. The asking price was $42.5 million, listed by Joseph Barbieri of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leona and her husband Harry B. Helmsley bought their property for $11 million in 1983 and spent $8 million on renovations, including a $1 million dance floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property played a key part in Ms. Helmsley's federal tax-evasion conviction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1989, the Helmsleys were accused of illegally billing their company for more than $3 million in renovations to the Greenwich estate. Ms. Helmsley was convicted and sentenced to 16 years in prison, though she served less than two. She died in August 2007.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Sale of New Rochelle Site Revives Development Talks</span>
</div><div class="author">By Dawn Wotapka   </div><div>610 words</div><div>20 June 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Efforts to revive New Rochelle's downtown have gotten a boost from the sale of a blighted former movie theater to a buyer who plans to rehabilitate the eyesore and, possibly, build an apartment building on the site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A venture of ABS Partners Real Estate LLC and Brause Realty Inc. has paid about $2.6 million for the 53,000-square-foot building at 587-599 Main St. that in its heyday was a Loews movie theater but later became the Palladium nightclub. For now, the new owners plan to upgrade the property and rent it to small retail and office tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when the economy gets stronger, the venture may revive a plan to develop apartments on the site, says Jason Fein, associate managing partner with Manhattan-based ABS. "It might be a short wait, it might be a longer wait," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Rochelle has shown signs of progress as city leaders and businesses have tried to reverse decades of decline. Several major residential projects were built there in recent years, including the Trump Plaza condominiums and multistory rental buildings with more than 1,000 units developed by <span class="companylink">AvalonBay Communities Inc</span>., one of the nation's largest apartment companies. But the downturn has slowed New Rochelle's effort to restore itself as a bustling transit-oriented hub. An earlier plan to develop housing at the Loews site was shelved. Because of slow sales, some Trump Plaza units are offered on a rent-to-own basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The theater site mirrors the tale of many early American suburbs. New Rochelle, mostly known as a bedroom community serving New York, saw tremendous growth and success during the first half of the 20th century, says Mayor Noam Bramson. Back then, the Loews theater was part of a flourishing downtown benefitting from its affluent residents and proximity to the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the city "went through a 50-year stretch of very significant economic challenges," Mr. Bramson says. Americans nationwide began abandoning their picturesque urban cores in favor of suburban neighborhoods and shopping malls. The New Rochelle area slipped into a downward spiral that bottomed out in the early 1990s, Mr. Bramson says. The city lost its Bloomingdale's department store in the 1970s. The theater, made obsolete by larger facilities with multiple screens, was also shuttered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shell later housed the Palladium night club, which closed in 2003, because of problems with drugs and underage drinking. "The streets were just out of control," recalls Ralph DiBart, executive director of New Rochelle's Downtown Business Improvement District.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the housing boom, the .77-acre site was under to contract to be sold to White Plains-based M Squared Development, which had earned approval to build more than 150 residences— both condos and rentals were considered—a three-level parking deck and retail space. But the housing market crashed before construction started and M Squared abandoned the deal. "It was a project where everything was going for it except the final timing," Mr. DiBart says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrew Buzzi Jr., the attorney representing the property's seller G &amp; G Properties LLC , says the men who have owned the site since the late 1980s are retiring. "Their kids have grown up, they've gone on to their own professions," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property was auctioned and the deal closed last month. Auctioneer Oren Klein with Tranzon Integrated Property Group says the existence of a former redevelopment plan helped the site command a higher price. "We definitely looked at it as a development opportunity," Mr. Fein said. "We like what we see in New Rochelle."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Alan Zibel and Luca Di Leo </div><div>496 words</div><div>17 June 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fewer unemployed Americans filed for jobless benefits last week, but claims remained at an elevated level, pointing to persistent weakness in the labor market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recovery has been held back by slow job growth and modest improvement in important economic sectors, such as housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New U.S. home construction rose slightly in May, but the long-troubled sector remains sluggish, a separate report showed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial jobless claims dropped 16,000 to a seasonally adjusted 414,000 in the week ended June 11, the Labor Department said in its report Thursday. They continued to hover above the key 400,000 level they have been at since early April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists tend to agree that when claims fall below that level, employers are adding more jobs than they are shedding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four-week moving average of new claims, considered a more reliable indicator because it smooths out volatile weekly data, remained unchanged from last week's 424,750 level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data indicates that the economic recovery that started in mid-2009 is losing steam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The manufacturing sector, once the driver of the recovery, stumbled in May as companies ratcheted back production and hiring. A persistent slowdown in hiring represents the biggest threat to the U.S. economy, the latest Wall Street Journal forecasting survey of economists found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Modest improvement in the housing sector, meanwhile, continues to hinder growth. Construction of homes and apartments last month increased 3.5% from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 560,000, the Commerce Department said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with the same month a year earlier, overall new-home construction in May was down 3.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family home starts, which made up about two-thirds of new home construction, rose by 3.7% from the level a month earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of multifamily homes containing at least two units, a volatile part of the market, was up 2.9% on a monthly basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While the increase is encouraging, starts remain at extremely depressed levels and any recovery will be long and arduous," <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo Securities</span> analysts wrote in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the overall economy grew at an annualized rate of 1.8% during the first three months of 2011, the battered housing sector weighed on growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders have been idled by weak demand from buyers, many of whom are nervous as home prices have fallen to the lowest point of the five-year housing bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers have been choosing foreclosures and other previously owned homes rather than new homes, which typically are more expensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reflecting weak demand, the number of homes under construction in May was at the lowest level on records dating back to 1970.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newly issued building permits, a gauge of future construction, increased 8.7% from a month earlier to an annual rate of 612,000, the highest level since December.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Pittsburgh Is Remade as Steal City; Downtown Booms With New Construction, Rising Office Rents; 'More and More Attractive'</span>
</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty   </div><div>893 words</div><div>15 June 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pittsburgh, once written off as a dying steel town, has turned into one of the most resilient office-rental markets in the U.S., prompting a flurry of building sales as some longtime owners take profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energy companies, moving in to develop Marcellus shale-gas projects, are stoking office demand. Employment is growing in such areas as medicine, education, financial services and computer software. The city's biggest bank, <span class="companylink">PNC Financial Services Group Inc</span>., last month said it would build a 40-story tower to help house its growing staff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Downtown is becoming more and more attractive," says James Rohr, PNC's chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis Inc</span>. projects that office rents in Pittsburgh will rise an average of 7.5% this year, compared with an average of 2% for the top 52 office markets in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pittsburgh's attractions for employers include Carnegie Mellon and other universities, as well office rents that remain low by national standards. CBRE says it expects annual office rents this year in Pittsburgh to average $18.69 a square foot, compared with a national average of $26.18. Pittsburgh's vacancy rate for offices this year is expected to average about 10%, compared with 16% nationally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite a weak national economy, Pittsburgh is looking more prosperous. The local government transformed downtown's Market Square, known until recently for drug dealing, into a European-style plaza where vendors sell flowers and goat cheese. Nearby, a glossy new bar, Andys, pays homage to former residents Andrew Carnegie and Andy Warhol.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More out-of-town investors are shopping for deals here, says Jeremy Kronman, an executive vice president at CBRE, who said he recently took a bus load of them on a tour. Partly as a result, owners of several office properties have put them on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the properties on the block: PPG Place, a complex of six spiky glass buildings, owned by affiliates of <span class="companylink">Hillman Co</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Pittsburgh has recovered from the loss of more than 100,000 steel-related jobs in the 1980s, problems remain. City government is struggling with pension burdens and a small tax base because much of the city is occupied by universities and other nonprofits that don't pay property levies. Most downtown workers live in the suburbs and pay little into the city's tax coffers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low housing costs help employers recruit people away from the coasts. The median home price in the five-county Pittsburgh metro area was about $113,000 in this year's first quarter, or 30% below the national level, according to RealSTATs, a Pittsburgh data tracker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big banks have long found Pittsburgh a good place for back-office operations, such as processing of securities transactions and mortgage loans. PNC employs about 10,000 people in the metro area, and <span class="companylink">Bank of New York Mellon Corp</span>., 7,600.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PNC, which already owns four buildings in downtown Pittsburgh and leases space in several others, is building a new $400 million headquarters here, due for completion in 2015, because "we need the space," Mr. Rohr says. That project will smarten up a block now featuring a check-cashing outlet and a shop selling Steeler jerseys, one of the last squalid corners of downtown Pittsburgh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pointing out of his 30th-floor office at the planned construction site, Mr. Rohr says, "When this gets finished, downtown's about done."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not quite: A new 28-acre redevelopment site is likely to open up on the edge of downtown if, as expected, the city knocks down a domed arena where the Penguins hockey team used to play.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">UPMC, a giant hospital operator that grew out of the University of Pittsburgh, absorbed much of the vacant office space downtown when it moved its headquarters into the <span class="companylink">U.S. Steel</span> building three years ago. Other big employers in or near downtown include <span class="companylink">Alcoa Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">H.J. Heinz Co</span>. and <span class="companylink">PPG Industries Inc</span>. <span class="companylink">Google Inc</span>. employs about 150 people in a converted cookie bakery near Carnegie Mellon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The expansion of Point Park University has provided occupants for more than a dozen older buildings downtown, many that had been languishing. More than 1,000 Point Park students now live downtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rugby Realty Co., based in New Rochelle, N.Y., started investing in Pittsburgh in the late 1980s and now owns 16 buildings here. Aaron Stauber, president of Rugby, says Pittsburgh has a more diversified economy than other Rust Belt cities and is more reasonably priced than glamour spots like New York or San Francisco. Rugby made money in Pittsburgh by betting on the potential of a former red-light district, now a thriving arts center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, Rugby has put two of its Pittsburgh buildings on the market. Mr. Stauber says that is because there are eager buyers and Rugby wants to free up cash for new investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kojaian Cos. recently hired <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> to sell the 37-story K&amp;L Gates Center downtown. Earlier this year, Area Property Partners of New York sold the 64-story <span class="companylink">U.S. Steel</span> building for about $250 million to an investment group headed by Mark Karasick and Michael Silberberg of New York.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CHICAGO—<span class="companylink">CME Group Inc</span>. is looking to sell most of the Chicago Board of Trade building, an iconic structure that has long been a symbol of the grain trade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CME plans to lease back the floor space and continue to operate those trading pits, yet veteran traders saw the announcement as another sign of the growing move to electronic trading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale of the north and south towers of the 80-year-old Art Deco building would include some of the trading-floor space where brokers bark out orders for corn and wheat futures. CME will retain ownership of the building's east tower, home to its financial-futures markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local realtors estimate that the two towers could fetch $150 a square foot, or about $210 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The north tower is topped by a three-story statue of Ceres, the Roman goddess of agriculture and grain, which presides over the canyon created by the office buildings that run alongside LaSalle Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The disclosure comes less than a week after the exchange operator warned it may shift its corporate headquarters ouf of Illinois to avoid an increase in corporate taxes, though a CME spokesman said selling the Board of Trade building isn't connected to discussions over a potential move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of any deal, the CME said it will aim to secure a 15-year lease on the sale of the facilities it currently uses and reiterated its commitment to open-outcry trading, which accounted for about 20% of the 3.1 billion futures and options traded on its markets last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Floor traders, who aren't authorized to speak with media by their employers, said the building going up for sale reinforced a long-held belief that the exchange wants to phase out open-outcry trading, which accounts for less than 15% of the volume in the grain markets right now. They noted the plan for the 15-year lease was relatively short and expect CME to take aggressive action to diminish the role of the floor starting next summer. In July 2012, an agreement requiring the exchange to consult former members on trading procedures expires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last decade, the parent of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange has ridden the wave of automation sweeping financial markets, helping to achieve rapid growth in its trading volumes and fueling the acquisition of rivals, including the Chicago Board of Trade in 2007 and <span class="companylink">New York Mercantile Exchange</span> in 2008. Last summer CME opened a new data center in the Chicago suburb of Aurora, built to house its trade-matching systems as well as the servers of computer-powered trading firms that rank among its busiest customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A CME spokeswoman said the company remains committed to floor trading for as long as there is demand for it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Driving the sale is CME's desire to exit the real-estate business and free up capital to reinvest in its core derivatives business, said Jamie Parisi, CME's chief financial officer, in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CME became a property owner through its deals for CBOT and Nymex. According to regulatory filings, the company reported a net property value of $786.8 million at the end of 2010, up from the $707.2 million in value estimated for 2008. A spokeswoman for CME said the company isn't planning a sale of the Nymex building in New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A representative for CME also downplayed any connection between the planned sale and any potential move of the corporate home of the world's largest futures exchange operator from Chicago, raised by CME Executive Chairman Terry Duffy last week at the company's annual shareholder meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Duffy said he and Mr. Parisi had been examining the possibility of relocating CME's corporate base outside Illinois, after the state in January sharply raised the corporate tax rate as part of efforts to put its finances in order.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CME leaders said they remain concerned about the tax issue but want to stay in Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A group of about 25 protesters gathered outside <span class="companylink">CME Group</span>'s Chicago headquarters a few blocks from the Board of Trade building Monday. They decried the company's complaints about state taxes and its warnings about potentially exiting Illinois.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CME said it hired <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle Inc</span>. and Holly Duran Real Estate Partners LLC to market the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts saw the announcement as a chance for CME to cash in on a recovery in corporate real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've seen the price per square foot of trophy properties improve over last year and a half, and it could be that CME's looking to monetize that," said Michael Larson, a real-estate and interest-rate analyst with Weiss Research. "The question is whether they may be a little too late, if the economy's starting to slump a bit again."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Chicago, the owners of the Willis Tower—formerly known as the Sears Tower—recently began seeking investors to buy all or a portion of the country's tallest skyscraper. Hines Interests has been looking to sell off a stake of a 50-story office building, known as the <span class="companylink">UBS</span> Tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Nagel, executive vice president for commercial real-estate services company Colliers International in Chicago, estimates CME could sell the 1.4 million square feet for about $150 square foot, or about $210 million. He said the buyer is likely to be a domestic investment group, such as a pension fund or real estate investment trust.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Eliot Brown   </div><div>700 words</div><div>14 June 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Democrats push to broaden the city's rent regulations in the final days of the legislative session, the level of any expansion will likely hinge on Democrats' willingness to grant concessions to the real-estate industry on other issues pushed by landlord groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rent laws expire Wednesday, although a temporary extension has been proposed by Senate Republicans that would push their expiration until Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a last-minute fashion typical of Albany in June, talks on the rent laws—which govern the rules surrounding the city's one million rent-stabilized apartments—have been limited thus far, with no in-depth negotiations, people familiar with discussions said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the early discussions have expanded well beyond the rent laws to include a larger bundle of legislation sought by large landlords and developers. The issues include a tax break for development of new apartments, a tax cap for owners of large rental apartments built in recent decades and legislation to reverse a court decision that lowered rents on some apartment buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Landlords have indicated that they would be willing to go along with a modest expansion of some rent regulations if they gain enough ground on the other issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We'll look at everything—including higher rents—it all depends on the package," said Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, which represents large landlords and developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is difficult to handicap to what extent the Legislature would accept a broader package of real-estate measures. The Democratic-controlled Assembly, which has been pressing to broadly expand regulations, hasn't ruled out any of the issues, although some individual members have openly opposed the landlord-friendly measures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Republican-controlled Senate has introduced legislation on all three measures, although Senate Majority leader Dean Skelos has not indicated his priorities publicly. He was mostly silent in a recent meeting on real-estate issues with Gov. Andrew Cuomo, the Assembly and real-estate executives, people familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Underlying the discussions is friction within the real-estate industry between large developers and small and mid-sized owners of older apartment buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the issues desired by developers—such as the tax break for apartments and for the tax cap on rental buildings—wouldn't benefit smaller landlords, leaving many of them opposed to expanding rent regulations in any form.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This disconnect is highlighted by differing approaches of the two most influential real-estate groups: the Real Estate Board, which has been pressing for the developer-friendly issues, and the Rent Stabilization Association, which strictly represents owners of older buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joseph Strasburg, president of the Rent Stabilization Association, said the Real Estate Board's openness to expanding the laws has caused "tension," given that his group opposes expanding rent regulations at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Nobody but this association has the right to negotiate away anything as it relates to our industry in terms of rent stabilization," Mr. Strasburg said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In particular, Mr. Strasburg and other groups representing smaller landlords—such as the Community Housing Improvement Program—have pushed to keep the minimum rent at which landlords can deregulate vacant apartments at $2,000 a month. Assembly Democrats are seeking to raise this number.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, both Mr. Strasburg and Mr. Spinola said that when negotiations come down to the wire, they believe there will not be a split between their groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've always had differences of opinion, but we always work it out," Mr. Spinola said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both groups have been strong financial supporters of Senate Republicans, although the Real Estate Board also have given to some Senate Democrats. The Rent Stabilization Association's annual luncheon this spring featured a speech by Mr. Skelos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While there is little time left to debate the rent laws, both sides consider it unlikely that they will be left to expire for more than a few days. Should the laws sunset without a renewal, new leases on rent-regulated apartments could be raised to market rates, which would drive many tenants out of their apartments.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Connecticut estate where actress Katharine Hepburn lived for many decades has been listed for $28 million by current owners Barbara and Frank Sciame, the chief executive of F.J. Sciame Construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home was in the Hepburn family from 1913 on, when her father bought it as a summer house. It was rebuilt in 1939 after a hurricane destroyed it. Ms. Hepburn, winner of four Academy Awards, lived there until her death in 2003 at age 96.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sciame bought the 3½-acre estate in 2004 and has since divided the property into three lots, raised the house five feet and completely renovated it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 8,300-square-foot house has six bedrooms and eight bathrooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Fenwick borough of Old Saybrook, Conn., the property comprises three lots and has a pond and 680 feet of waterfront on Long Island Sound. (The lots are available separately—the largest, which includes the house and a dock, for $18 million.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sciame said he first bought the home with the intent of renovating it and selling it, "but my family fell in love with it" and ended up spending summers there. The Sciames are based primarily in Locust Valley, N.Y. Colette Harron, with William Pitt Sotheby's International Realty in Essex, Conn., has the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weight-loss guru Jenny Craig has cut the price on her Rancho Santa Fe, Calif., equestrian estate to $25 million from $30 million. The property, about 30 minutes north of San Diego, came on the market a little over a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Known as Rancho Paseana, the property's 229 acres include a ¾-mile racetrack, two guest houses, an olive orchard, five barns, a veterinarian's suite and staff quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Craig and her late husband, Sidney, co-founded the weight-loss company bearing her name. Jeff Hyland with Hilton &amp; Hyland/Christie's International Real Estate in Beverly Hills, shares the equestrian listing with Catherine Barry and Jason Barry of Barry Estates in Rancho Santa Fe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Butch Trucks, the drummer for the Allman Brothers Band, has sold his Palm Beach, Fla., home for $2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home listed for $3.3 million last year, and most recently had an asking price of $3 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Built in 1954, the 5,000 square-foot Mediterranean-style home is less than a five-minute walk from the beach. It has six bedrooms and a grand library.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trucks bought the home in 1999 and said he sold because he and his wife are planning to retire in the south of France.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christian J. Angle of Christian Angle Real Estate in Palm Beach represented Mr. Trucks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bill Yahn of <span class="companylink">Corcoran Group</span> Palm Beach represented the buyer, who bought the home through a limited liability company.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Office Owners Seek to Cash In --- Big-Name Buildings Go on Block as Prices Boom; 'Who Knows What Market Will Be Like' in a Year?</span>
</div><div class="author">By Eliot Brown </div><div>925 words</div><div>8 June 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owners of big-name office buildings in some U.S. cities are racing to put them up for sale to exploit surging prices before it is too late.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent weeks, owners of the Willis Tower in Chicago, Constitution Center in Washington, the Seagram Building in New York and numerous other large properties have put all or portions of them on the block. They are hoping to cash in on the near-boom-era prices being paid by yield-hungry investors discouraged by the volatility of stocks and low interest rates in the bond market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surge comes as the U.S. economy shows new signs of weakness, raising questions about the direction of office rents and vacancy rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Who knows what the market will be like in a year or so?" says Tim Jaroch, one of the general partners who own the 1.4 million-square-foot Constitution Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, the total value of new sales listings of U.S. office buildings was $8.7 billion, according to real-estate research firm <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>. That was the highest level since 2008. Preliminary data for May show $10 billion in new listings, which would be the highest monthly total since late 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently, post-recession sales activity in the office market has been slow. Lenders have held onto distressed assets rather than sell them, frustrating many investors who hoped to take advantage of the pain of others. Even as values rise, many owners continue to resist selling because they don't like their options for investing the proceeds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sharp rise in values has come over the past year, a relatively short time frame in the real-estate market. Recent deals include the sale of 750 Seventh Ave. in New York's Times Square by Hines Interests for a surprisingly high $485 million and Beacon Capital Partners' sale of Market Square in Washington for a record $905 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're making decisions to sell because we're achieving very fair values," said Fred Seigel, Beacon's president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, real-estate research firm Green Street Advisors reported that its index of Midtown Manhattan office-building values is up 88% since its mid-2009 nadir, back to within 15% of their 2007 peak. The index is tilted toward better quality buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beacon also is considering bringing to market 1211 Ave. of the Americas in coming weeks, for which the company would look to retrieve well above the $1.5 billion that it paid in 2006, according to people familiar with the matter. The 45-story property houses the headquarters of <span class="companylink">News Corp</span>., publisher of The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strong appetite for office property is limited mostly to major cities. Suburban office markets, getting harder hit by the economic downturn, are suffering from weak vacancy and rent rates, putting a damper on investor demand and values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building owners in some office markets contrast sharply with the residential market, where home prices have declined for months. Last week, the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index reported home prices were down 4.2% in the first quarter of 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors are more bullish on commercial property partly because there was relatively little overbuilding during the boom. Rents have been climbing in cities like New York and Washington, although they remain heavily dependent on job growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is still a lack of quality product for sale, and investors want to be in these markets," said Douglas Harmon, a broker at Eastdil Secured who is marketing the Willis Tower along with real-estate firm Newmark Knight Frank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The financing market and interest-rate environment also is fueling the surge. Buyers are finding it easier and less expensive to borrow and, with interest rates at historic lows, even a relatively low yield on office property becomes attractive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the rise in value is being fueled more by trends in the capital markets than by improving rents. For example, in Midtown Manhattan, rents are still 35% below their peak, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield and growing less quickly than values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, the sales numbers are still leagues below their 2007 peak, when buyers were able to borrow nearly the entire price of buildings. That year saw a peak $209 billion in office-building sales in the U.S., according to Real Capital. For 2011, real-estate advisory firm <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> projects $73 billion in office sales, up from $43 billion in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While new buyers are betting on a strong future in the market, the high prices -- back so rapidly from the market's trough -- have given some investors pause. Large New York City developers, including Douglas Durst, have said prices have risen too high to justify acquisitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some owners are hedging their bets by selling stakes in buildings but retaining an interest to benefit if values keep rising. In Chicago, Hines recently began marketing a stake in the 1.4 million-square-foot One North Wacker Drive, a Hines spokeswoman confirmed. The owners of the Seagram Building also are looking for an investor to buy a piece of the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You get to hold onto the real estate and you get to cash a big check," notes Darcy Stacom, vice chairman of <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Douglas C. Yearley Jr. is the chief executive of luxury builder Toll Brothers Inc. His last name was misspelled as Yearly in Saturday's Weekend Investor article on housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(WSJ June 9, 2011)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in June 2006, when the housing market peaked, the prospect of a five-year national housing bust seemed unimaginable to most people. And yet here we are, with the latest <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller index showing that prices hit new bear-market lows, falling back to 2002 levels nationally and to 1990s levels in some battered regions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite all the gloom, however, there are growing indications that it is a good time to buy. Mortgage rates, which fell to 4.55% for the week ending June 2, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, are near 50-year lows. Homes have become more affordable than they have been in years: According to <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics, the ratio of home prices to income is now 20.9% lower than the 15-year average through 2010, and 12.5% lower than the 1989-2004 average. A historic glut of homes, meanwhile, has created a buyer's market: There were about 15 million vacant homes in the U.S. last year, according to John Burns Real Estate Consulting Inc. -- some 3.1 million more than normal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such conditions might not last long. <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics predicts that the number of distressed sales will begin to fall in 2013, and that prices will begin to edge upward then. Home building is at a virtual standstill, so the supply overhang isn't likely to get much worse. Meanwhile, demographic indicators such as "household formation" -- the number of new households each year -- are on the rise, and promise to take a bite out of the glut in coming years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upshot: "While we might not see rapid growth in the next couple of years, there are a tremendous number of positive signs that could lead to a rebound," says Anthony Sanders, a real-estate finance professor at George Mason University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The short-term outlook isn't encouraging. Job growth remains weak, foreclosure sales are making up more of the market, and economists are predicting that home prices will fall more in the coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the long-term benefits of homeownership remain very much intact. For now, at least, you can deduct the mortgage interest on your taxes -- a big perk for people in higher tax brackets. You get to paint your walls any color you wish, without having to clear it with a landlord. And assuming you can buy a home for about the same price as you can rent one, buying will give you the ability one day to live rent-free. Come retirement time, a paid-off mortgage means your monthly expenses are significantly reduced, and you have a chunk of equity to play with.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what might the next five years look like? Once the foreclosure mess begins to clear up, say housing economists, the traditional drivers of the housing market -- demographics, affordability, loan availability, employment and psychology -- should take over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here is a glimmer of what the future may hold: While overall home prices fell by 7.5% in April over the same period a year earlier, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>, a Santa Ana, Calif., provider of real-estate data and analytics, if you exclude distressed sales, prices were off just 0.5%. So if you are in a market that isn't battered by foreclosures, you may be close to a bottom already.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The regular marketplace is hanging tough," says <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> chief economist Mark Fleming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here is a look at five key factors that will govern local markets over the next several years:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demographics</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Household formation fell during the economic downturn as a weak economy led some people to stay in school, double up with roommates or move in with family members. According to <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics, the number of new households renting or owning a home dropped to 578,000 in 2008 from nearly 2 million in 2005, just before the peak of the housing boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But household formation increased to nearly 950,000 last year, says <span class="companylink">Moody's</span>, and should average 1.2 million over the next decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, combined with increased obsolescence and higher demand for second homes, should begin sopping up excess inventory in much of the country over the next two years, <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Whatever the excess supply of housing is, it is shrinking pretty fast," says Thomas Lawler, an independent housing economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the uptick in household formation is likely to come from the leading edge of the echo baby boomers, who have been waiting for the economy to recover before striking out on their own, says William Frey, a demographer with the Brookings Institution. That is likely to fuel an increase in demand for both rental apartments and starter homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The portion of people moving across the country has fallen to the lowest level since World War II, he adds. That is a sign that many people have put their lives on hold because of the weak economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When things do pick up, there will be this pent-up demand for everything involved with starting a household," Mr. Frey says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, when prices in healthier regions begin to rise, many would-be sellers who have sat on the sidelines could begin putting homes on the market, muting the price gains at first, says Susan Wachter, a professor of real estate and finance at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. Even so, she expects home prices to stabilize and begin to strengthen over the next two or three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There also are some powerful demographic cross-currents worth considering. The first baby boomers turned 65 in January, an age when demand for new homes falls and many begin to think about downsizing. "The baby-boom generation pushed prices up as they got older," says Dowell Myers, a professor of urban planning and demography at the University of Southern California. But in the coming years, "boomers will start flooding the market on the supply side" with larger homes, while fueling new demand for smaller properties with more services and amenities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affordability</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising home prices made renting cheaper than buying in many parts of the country. But that dynamic has begun to change: Housing affordability, as measured by the ratio of median home prices to median household incomes, has fallen below pre-housing bubble levels in just over two-thirds of the country, according to an analysis of more than 380 metro areas by <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renting is still cheaper than buying in most markets, but rising rents and falling house prices mean that, in some areas, this won't be the case for long. Buying a home is already cheaper than renting in Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit and Orlando, Fla., according to <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics. In other markets, including Dallas, Las Vegas and Sacramento, Cailf., the equation is likely to soon turn in favor of homeownership if current trends persist, the firm says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Ann Arbor, Mich., where home prices fell 11.2% between 2007 and 2010, according to Fiserv Case-Shiller, housing affordability has risen well above historical levels, according to <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is good news for home buyers such as Steven Upton, a 42-year-old photographer, who in June will close on four-bedroom brick house on 10 acres in an upscale community in Ann Arbor. Mr. Upton paid $400,000 for the home, which previously listed for $600,000. "It's a tremendous deal," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before buying a house, it is wise to compare rental prices for similar properties. To be ultraconservative, wait until the monthly outlays, including taxes and insurance, are equal. You also could factor in the tax savings of owning, which would make buying more attractive even if the gross monthly outlay is slightly higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employment</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strength of the housing market depends largely on the economy. Rising incomes and increased employment tend to give more would-be buyers confidence and buying power. For now, job growth remains sluggish: On Friday the Labor Department reported that just 54,000 jobs were created in May, far below expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But signs of how a stronger job market could fuel housing demand are evident in the Dallas metro area, which added 83,100 new jobs in the 12 months ending in April -- the largest gain in the nation, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Dallas never had a big housing boom or bust and has benefited from trade with Mexico, a strong telecommunications sector and a central location.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The opportunities for a job with more responsibility drew Duane and Linda Elmer to Dallas from Des Moines, Iowa, where Mr. Elmer was a banker for nine years. The couple has agreed to pay $415,000 for a four-bedroom, four-bath house with a Jacuzzi and pool. Their Des Moines home, purchased nine years ago for $410,000, is on the market for $390,000. "We are willing to take the loss for the opportunity to live in a more diverse community and to take a job with greater breadth of responsibilities," Mr. Elmer says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowers like the Elmers who are relocating for job opportunities are a big driver of home sales in nearby Plano, Texas, says Harry Ridge, a real-estate agent. He says such sales accounted for 20% of his business last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A similar influx of job seekers is fueling housing demand in the Washington area, where 25,700 new jobs were added in the 12 months since April 2010. Washington was the only one of the 20 cities tracked by <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> and Case-Shiller that saw home prices rise both on a month-to-month and year-over-year basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Credit</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage financing remains plentiful for borrowers with good credit scores and solid employment histories. But for borrowers who don't fit traditional lending standards, getting a loan can still be nearly impossible. In the first quarter, about 10% of banks tightened standards for nontraditional loans, according to the Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, higher down-payment standards are locking some would-be buyers out of the market. Just 35% of renters have the minimum 3.5% down payment needed for an FHA loan on the median-priced home in their market, according to a recent survey by Zelman Associates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Credit is likely to remain tight for at least the next six months, says Clifford Rossi, a former <span class="companylink">Citigroup Inc</span>. consumer-lending executive who teaches at the University of Maryland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But conditions should improve over time, he says: "There's no question that it will gradually get easier."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That will be welcome news to borrowers like Greg Silver. The 50-year-old real-estate developer would like to buy a second home, but hasn't been able to secure a jumbo mortgage because his income consists of capital gains from sales of the properties he develops. Mr. Silver closed three sales in the past 12 months, netting him a total of more than $25 million, but didn't record any capital gains in 2008 and 2009. Sure, he could use some of that cash to buy a home outright, but he would prefer to mortgage it, get the tax deduction and keep his cash free for business purposes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a little devastating," says Mr. Silver, who is living in Greenwich, Conn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Psychology</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The long-term case for buying over renting remains in force. Yet nowadays, "People are simply scared," says Aaron Galvin, chief executive of Luxury Living Chicago, which finds rental apartments for wealthy clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Galvin says he has seen a 30% increase in business in the last year, driven by would-be home buyers who can afford to purchase a property but are choosing not to do so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The portion of Americans who believe homeownership is a safe investment dropped to 66% in the first quarter from 83% in 2006, according to <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, the government-controlled mortgage company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it isn't clear whether the fear will result in a prolonged change in attitudes, as during the Great Depression, or have little long-term impact, as was the case for the housing bust that shook California and the Northeast in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Eighty-seven percent of people surveyed by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> said they preferred owning to renting, though access to schools, control over one's environment and other quality-of-life issues now are seen as the key benefits of homeownership, with building wealth and other financial factors viewed as less important. In addition, 67% of renters surveyed by Zelman Associates said they planned to buy a home in the next five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey Connor may be a bellwether for the future of the housing market. The 40-year-old finance director at a corporate law firm says he thought briefly about buying a house when he moved to Chicago from Washington in October. But he opted instead to rent a luxury two-story apartment in downtown Chicago for $3,559 a month. Mr. Connor says it will take substantial job growth and a sharp drop in foreclosures to convince him to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market is clearly soft," he says, "especially when we consider it good news that the unemployment rate is hovering around 9% instead of 10%." Mr. Connor says he isn't worried about missing out on today's low interest rates and will consider buying once unemployment falls to 6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other buyers are showing less willingness to wait for the absolute perfect time to buy. Doug Yearly, chief executive of luxury builder <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers Inc</span>., told investors in May that "some of our clients, after waiting so long, are starting to move off the fence and into the market, motivated by attractive pricing, low interest rates and, most important, the desire to take the next step in their lives. The family with elementary-school kids and a puppy when the housing debacle began five years ago now has middle-school kids and the dog weighs 80 pounds."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As land values rise in some parts of the country, time is running out for states and conservation groups that have been taking advantage of the downturn by snapping up parcels of pristine land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These groups have purchased thousands of acres that would have been out of reach during the boom years. But now, an increased sense of urgency has begun to fuel such deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the most recent: Massachusetts paid $3 million for 782 acres in the foothills of the Berkshire mountains that will be added to an existing state forest. The state paid $2 million less than the value reached recently by an appraiser of the undeveloped property, which contains a lake and forestland filled with moose, bears and turkeys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a recognition that this is a very special time, and that it won't last," says Bob Wilber, director of land protection for Mass Audubon, a conservation group in the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will Rogers, president and chief executive of the Trust for Public Land in California, says land values have started to stabilize in many parts of the country after dropping as much as 50% in some markets. Nationally, 2011 first-quarter finished-lot prices were 14% above the first-quarter 2009 trough, though they remained 51% lower than peak values, according to a survey of markets by housing-research firm Zelman &amp; Associates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The downturn, of course, has been a double-edged sword for conservation groups. Funding from many public and private sources for purchasing and protecting land has been cut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the soured economy has pushed many long-term holders to opt out of paying property taxes and other carrying costs on properties without cash flows. That has put an unusually wide array of unique properties on the market, Mr. Wilber says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late last year, for example, the San Juan Preservation Trust acquired Vendovi Island off the coast of Washington state in a deal that valued the property at $6.4 million, well below the $12.5 million at which it was recently appraised. Separately, the Trust for Public Land last year led a group that acquired 138 acres behind the iconic "Hollywood" sign in Los Angeles for $11.7 million. It had previously been on the market for $22 million, according to the trust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Massachusetts has maintained its commitment to conserve land despite tight fiscal constraints. The state spent $50 million on land conservation for the four years through the 2011 fiscal year, which ends in June. In fiscal year 2010, the Department of Conservation and Recreation spent an average of $2,649 an acre, down from $3,463 an acre in 2008. "We're buying more with the same amount of money," says Richard Sullivan Jr., Massachusetts's secretary of energy and environmental affairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The opportunity in the Berkshires arose because the land's owners simply got tired of waiting for development to reach that far. More than 30 years ago, the land was acquired by Jerry Finkelstein, whose uncle founded the Astoria, N.Y., tire wholesaler Max Finkelstein Inc., and a group of his friends. They paid about $600,000 for the chunk of wilderness some 28 miles from the Tanglewood music venue, which is in Lenox, Mass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group had planned to sell off large lots as second-home estates, but Mr. Finkelstein says demand for homes in the relatively remote area didn't come as fast as he and the other investors anticipated. All of the investors are now in their 70s, and they decided it was time to sell, he says. Last year, they hired Great Rock Real Estate of Boston to market the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think we had it long enough," says Mr. Finkelstein, who is 73 years old.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conservation groups flew into action soon after the land was put on the block, Mr. Wilber says. The property is near one of the state's largest parks, and it had long been on the state and conservationists' radar because they knew the investors had toyed with developing it. The groups quickly called a meeting and determined it would be best for the state to pursue the property, because it owned the nearby Tolland State Forest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Finkelstein, who likes to fish, called the property "magnificent" but says he visited rarely and then only to survey the property, because he had his own second home in the Catskills. He says he "made a few dollars" from the sale and is happy his group was able to sell to the state so that other people can enjoy the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeremy Freid, a principal of Great Rock Real Estate, said the state and other bidders who planned to use the property themselves made the most compelling offers. "This is a 'user' play," Mr. Freid says. "We got a lot of lowball offers from developers who said, 'for pennies on the dollar, we'll sit on it until the market changes.' "</p>

</div><div class="author">By Arian Campo-Flores   </div><div>1005 words</div><div>1 June 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MIAMI—When the real estate market collapsed five years ago, this city's downtown soon became an emblem of the worst excesses of the building boom. Glittering new towers sat mostly vacant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those towers are filling up much sooner than some analysts predicted. The new arrivals, mostly renters, are spurring the establishment of restaurants, bars and shops. Streets that once grew desolate at the end of the workday now buzz with residents walking around and dining at outdoor tables.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A few years ago, you couldn't be here at night without dogs and guns," said William Richey, a 68-year-old lawyer who lives in the Central Business District, while dining one recent evening at Trë, a new bistro. "Now it's full of life."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A February report by the Miami Downtown Development Authority found that 85% of new condo units, those built since 2003, were occupied, up from 74% in 2010 and 62% in 2009. The residential population of downtown—which, broadly defined, stretches from the emerging Wynwood arts neighborhood in the north to the gritty CBD to the flashier Brickell financial district in the south—now numbers about 70,000, compared with 40,000 a decade ago. Another 10,000 people are expected to move in by 2014, according to the Development Authority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ambitious new projects are on the way. In April, Hong Kong-based <span class="companylink">Swire Properties</span> unveiled plans for Brickell CitiCentre, a five-million-square-foot development with a hotel, residences, office towers and retail outlets. Construction is expected to begin next year. Last week, Genting Malaysia Berhad, of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, announced a deal to buy 14 acres of waterfront property where the Miami Herald building currently sits. The company plans to build a complex with restaurants, entertainment venues and, if the Florida legislature authorizes it, casino gambling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I never expected it would be as vibrant as it is today," said Andres del Corral, a 30-year-old commercial real estate broker who moved to the area three years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether Miami's momentum will continue, leading to the 24-hour city that downtown boosters dream of, is unclear. Miami-Dade County's 13.2% unemployment rate, the second-highest in a state hard hit overall by the economic downturn, remains a drag on the local economy, and the region continues to reel from the mortgage foreclosure crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The [downtown] market on the surface appears to be doing really well," said Glenn H. Gregory, senior vice president at commercial brokerage firm <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>. "The question is whether that will be sustainable."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, the housing sector continues to suffer. On Tuesday, the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index showed that home prices in the U.S. fell 4.2% in the first quarter; the Miami metro area was among 12 where prices fell to their lowest levels in the current housing cycle. Parts of Miami-Dade County generally continue to post some of the highest foreclosure rates in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many buyers are investors who plan to unload their properties eventually, said Peter Zalewski, principal at real estate consultancy Condo Vultures LLC. Mr. Zalewski's question is: "Will they dump at the same time?" That would depress prices, potentially reversing the area's revival.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condo sales here began to surge after property owners slashed prices about two years ago, sometimes by 50% or more. That lured hordes of international buyers, including Brazilians and Venezuelans, who often pay entirely in cash. Fewer than 4,000 out of the 22,000 new units built since 2003 remain unsold, according to Condo Vultures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Icon Brickell, a luxurious three-tower complex that for many came to epitomize the height of the speculative frenzy, more than 80% of the units have been sold, according to <span class="companylink">Fortune International</span>, which markets the units. Sales are averaging 47 units a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past year, prices for new condos downtown have begun ticking up, from $298 a square foot in 2009 to $304 in 2010, according to Condo Vultures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residents say downtown is more animated than ever. When Geri Fischman moved to the area from South Beach three years ago, the nightlife options were scant. Now Ms. Fischman, 28, has a slew of them within walking distance, including db Bistro Moderne, the new Miami outpost of famed chef Daniel Boulud. Coming soon across the street from her place: a Whole Foods supermarket and a luxury movie theater. "I can't remember the last time I went to South Beach," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As young professionals and families move in, the area's vibe has changed. Bayfront Park in the Central Business District now has free yoga classes three times a week. Parents pushing strollers are a common sight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The newcomers have encouraged new businesses to open—a net of 38 in 2010, according to the Downtown Development Authority. Another 27 are currently planned for this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many existing establishments have changed their mix of merchandise to appeal to a younger, more affluent demographic. At La Epoca, a department store in the CBD, clothing racks that once featured Levi's denims now have Diesel jeans and Hugo Boss shirts. "Sales keep growing each year," said owner Tony Alonso.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Downtown still has a way to go, especially the CBD, which remains crammed with grubby storefronts. "It's a bit of a mud hole," said Tony Goldman, a longtime developer who helped transform South Beach and is now considering investing downtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Development Authority officials are working on a master plan for the district. They recently helped organize a gathering of business leaders in the CBD to hear a presentation by Mr. Goldman, who outlined his vision for a pedestrian-friendly neighborhood centered on its historic buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It could be this fabulous oasis," Mr. Goldman said in an interview. "I think it's never been more ripe."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending by Americans slowed in April, a sign that rising prices for gasoline and groceries squeezed the economic recovery going into spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another disappointing report Friday on the struggling recovery showed the National Association of Realtors trimmed its forecast for home sales in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer spending in the U.S. last month gained 0.4%, less than March's downwardly revised 0.5% increase. And when adjusted for inflation, spending went up only 0.1% for a second month in a row.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department report said Americans' incomes grew modestly and that they saved at a rate of 4.9%, the lowest level since October 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That is a sign that people are dipping into their piggy banks to keep driving," Naroff Economic Advisors President Joel Naroff wrote in a note to clients. "Consumers are trying to spend money but the higher price of goods and services has limited their ability to do that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy slowed considerably in the first three months of 2011, partly because consumers cut their spending amid higher commodity prices. The Commerce data indicate consumers were vulnerable at the start of the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists have said the price increases will prove transitory and indeed commodity prices have fallen off their late-April peak, leading gasoline prices to ease in recent weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, a separate report Friday on consumer sentiment at the end of May showed the mood of Americans improved and expectations for inflation eased: The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final May consumer sentiment index increased to 74.3 from the preliminary May reading of 72.4. There has been some improvement in the labor market, with jobs growth in the private sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, unemployment in the U.S. remains high. Americans have had trouble getting higher pay in the slow economic recovery, putting a damper on spending. A payroll tax cut this year has been offset by gasoline prices rising close to $4 a gallon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, Federal Reserve governor Elizabeth Duke said incomes have not kept pace with rising costs and that many families are facing the decision whether to buy gas or make home payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday's data showed the price index for personal consumption expenditures increased 2.2% on a year-over-year basis, after rising 1.8% in March. Compared with the prior month, the gauge rose 0.3% in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report showed underlying inflation, watched closely by the Fed, also sped up in April. The core PCE price index, which excludes food and energy prices because of their volatility, increased 1.0% year over year, after rising 0.9% in March. Compared with the prior month, the core gauge in April rose 0.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher prices seem to have hurt the battered housing market this spring. The National Association of Realtors reported the number of people who signed contracts to buy previously occupied homes in the U.S. tumbled last month. Its seasonally adjusted index for pending sales of existing homes decreased 11.6% on a monthly basis to 81.9. Year over year, the gauge was 26.5% below its level in April 2010, which is when a tax subsidy for first-time home buyers expired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, the NAR's chief economist, said the drop may reflect an economic soft patch in April driven by higher oil prices, severe weather and a bump in unemployment claims.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The pullback in contract signings is disappointing and implies a slower-than-expected market recovery in upcoming months," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors group forecasts that existing home sales will rise 5% in 2011, a downgrade from an earlier projection of 7.7%. New single-family home sales are expected to decline 4.2%, compared with an earlier forecast of a 0.5% drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With prices still declining, there is little incentive for buyers to be aggressive," MFR Inc. economist Joshua Shapiro said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Ryan Dezember   </div><div>591 words</div><div>28 May 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOUSTON—There are plenty of ways for investors to tap into the growth of emerging markets. For Joel Wells, who co-manages the Alpine Emerging Markets Real Estate Equity Fund (AEMEX), the best way is through real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the middle-class blooms in such countries as Brazil, Thailand and Turkey, there are opportunities to invest in home builders, shopping-mall developers and industrial estate planners, Mr. Wells said. "In emerging markets, you have fundamental supply-and-demand disequilibrium," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Emerging Markets Real Estate fund sprung from the experience Alpine's stock pickers gained managing their International Real Estate Equity Fund (EGLRX), which was one of the first of its kind when it launched in 1989.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That fund started with about 7% of its assets invested in emerging markets, Mr. Wells said. That eventually swelled to about 58%, prompting Alpine, in November 2008, to start a fund giving investors a "pure play on emerging market real estate," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Emerging Markets fund invests in all manner of real estate-related stocks, though more than 43% of its $5.8 million in assets is invested in companies that are focused on the residential sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of Thursday, the fund is down 6.05% in 2011, according to Morningstar.com. The one-year return is nearly 32%, fractionally below its benchmark, the MSCI EAFE index. The fund handily outperformed the benchmark during its first two full years, though, according to Morningstar, which doesn't assign an analyst to cover the fund since it isn't yet three years old.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fund has investments in about 30 countries, though about 25% of its assets are allocated to Brazil, which Mr. Wells says is in a development phase—housing boom, retail consolidation, major infrastructure investment—analogous to where the U.S. was in the 1950s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To that end, the fund's largest holding, at nearly 5%, is PDG Realty S/A Empreendimentos e Participacoes, which builds low-cost housing across the South American country, where the government has launched home-buying incentive programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wells says he also likes shopping center developer <span class="companylink">BR Malls</span> Participacoes S/A, low-cost home builder <span class="companylink">Direcional Engenharia S/A</span> and Sao Paulo-centered <span class="companylink">Even Construtora e Incorporadora S/A</span>, which caters to a more-affluent clientele.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wells also is high on the Turkish market, where a burgeoning mortgage industry paired with a shortage of housing has spurred him to invest about 3% of the fund's assets in real-estate investment trust <span class="companylink">Emlak Konut Gayrimenkul Yatirim Ortakligi</span> AS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It has a complicated name but it has a very simple business model," Mr. Wells says. The Turkish government is Emlak's primary shareholder. As such, the company has quicker access to land and permits than its competitors, Mr. Wells says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese stocks account for nearly 9% of the fund's portfolio, ranking it second to Brazil. Shares in Thai, Indonesian and Philippine companies also figure prominently in the portfolio. and are a good way to profit on growth in some of the countries that emerged strongest from the Asian financial crisis, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Thailand, Mr. Wells says the smart play is <span class="companylink">Amata Corp</span>., which acquires tracts of land, installs roads, sewers and power lines, and then sells the sites to auto and electronics manufacturers looking to diversify production, say from earthquake-damaged Japan, or to relocate from China in pursuit of even lower cost labor.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK—More evidence of a crumbling housing market deepened U.S. economic concerns and sent investors scrambling for safety into shorter-maturity Treasurys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treasury prices have rallied in recent weeks on a stream of disappointing U.S. economic data. Escalating concerns about a potential Greek debt restructuring and about the contagion spreading to other euro-zone debt markets have added to safe-harbor bids for U.S. government bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, government-bond prices initially fell as some investors booked profits from the recent rally. But buyers scooped up Treasurys on an 11.6% drop in pending home sales for April, which was much steeper than the 2% decline forecast by economists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are a long way from a true economic recovery, or at least one that causes inflation and higher interest rates," said Kevin Giddis, president of fixed-income capital markets at Morgan Keegan Inc. in Memphis, Tenn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traders said the Treasury market is overbought, with growing risks of profit-taking, yet a selloff is unlikely. The 10-year yield, trading at the lowest level in more than five months, has the potential to fall below 3% in coming weeks, they said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I have been buying on dips" on concerns about U.S. growth and the euro zone's sovereign-debt problems, said Sean Murphy, a senior Treasury trader at <span class="companylink">Société Générale</span> in New York. Mr. Murphy expects the 10-year note's yield to trade between 2.9% and 3.25% over the next few weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Friday afternoon trading, the benchmark 10-year note was 4/32 lower in price to yield 3.077%. Bond prices move inversely to their yields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The yield fell from 3.152% at the end of last week. It has dropped from about 3.5% in early April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shorter-dated notes did better Friday. The five-year note was 2/32 higher to yield 1.721%, and the two-year note was 1/32 higher to yield 0.476%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jason Rogan, director of U.S. government-bond trading in New York at <span class="companylink">Guggenheim Partners LLC</span>, said the 10-year yield faces strong resistance at 3.05%, which represents a 50% retracement of the yield from its October trough to its February peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A break of 3.05% would clear the last technical hurdle for the yield to break 3% and open the way for the yield to slip to 2.8%, traders said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bond market closed at 2 p.m. EDT and will also be shut on Monday for the Memorial Day holiday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. two-year swap spread, which measures the differential between the two-year swap rate and two-year Treasury yield and is a main gauge of credit risks, was 0.5 basis points wider at 19.25 basis points. The 10-year swap spread was 0.75 basis point wider at 9.75 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spate of weak U.S. economic data dragged the dollar down, as concerns about slower growth and a Federal Reserve committed to loose monetary policy sent the greenback to a two-week low against major currencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ebbing fears about Europe's sovereign-debt problems lifted the euro Friday, as a lack of news on Greece's financial crisis encouraged investors to buy back the single currency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fears that house prices still haven't hit bottom were underscored by the National Association of Realtors' report that the pending home sales index fell 12% in April, much worse than economists' forecast. Personal spending also missed expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dour U.S. data come just as the Fed is nearing the end of a $600 billion bond-buying program, also known as quantitative easing, designed to jump-start growth, hinting to some analysts that more stimulus may be needed. The possibility of lingering U.S. easy monetary policy fired the euro's late-week surge against the dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If it looks like we are heading toward another soft patch, it would be hard to make a case to remain long dollars in a major way," said Bob Keiser, vice president with <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Valuation and Risk Strategies Research. He said he believes the dollar is due for a rally, but mixed economic data raise risks to that scenario.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late Friday in New York, the euro was at $1.4286 from $1.4137 late Thursday. The dollar was at ¥80.85 from ¥81.35, while the euro was at ¥115.50 from ¥115.01. The U.K. pound was at $1.6481 from $1.6390. The dollar was at 0.8525 Swiss franc from 0.8660 franc late Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro began the week hunkered at a two-month low against the dollar below $1.40, amid concerns that Greece may restructure its debt and that promised financial support from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund might not materialize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A consensus has emerged among analysts that there is no way out for Greece, save a reorganization of its debt obligations, which could trigger a new round of market stress. However, the lack of new developments momentarily refocused attention on the euro zone's yield advantage over the U.S., sending the euro on a relief rally since Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In general, the euro has a strong tailwind and significant headwind," said Kevin Hebner, currency strategist at <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span> in New York. He sees the European Central Bank adding an additional 0.75 to 1.0 percentage point to its 1.25% rate, which should send the euro back up toward $1.48.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calling Europe's debt woes volatile but manageable, Mr. Hebner said "there's an awful lot of noise, but underneath that Greece will get the money it needs."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The woeful fundamentals of the euro and the dollar have made the Swiss franc the most reliable barometer of the market's risk aversion. The safe-haven franc has knocked both the dollar and euro to record lows, underscoring how neither is truly favored by traders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Unlike Germany, Switzerland is not part of the euro currency and therefore is not on the hook for bailing out the periphery countries," said Andrew Busch, global currency strategist at BMO Capital Markets in a research note Friday.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans spent a little less freely last month, suggesting the economic recovery is losing some momentum as people feel the pinch of higher food and gas prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity in the U.S., ticked up 0.4% in April after rising 0.5% a month earlier, the Commerce Department said Friday. Adjusted for price changes, spending rose just 0.1%, the same increase as in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers are "off to a subdued start" in the second quarter, said John Ryding, an RDQ Economics analyst. "They're having to spend more for necessities."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers face a litany of concerns, including high unemployment, stagnant wages and another slip in the housing market. Personal income rose 0.4% in April after rising by the same percentage a month earlier. The savings rate was flat last month at 4.9% of disposable income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising fuel and food costs drove a 0.3% rise in the price index for personal consumption expenditures in April, putting it up 2.2% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The core price index, which strips out food and energy and is closely watched by the Federal Reserve, increased 0.2% in April and was up 1% from a year earlier -- below the Fed's preferred range of around 2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report suggested that consumers' mood improved this month as gasoline prices leveled off. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment rose to 74.3 from 69.8. Expectations for annual inflation over the next five to 10 years were stable at 2.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market, though, looks set to decline further. An index of pending home sales, based on contract signings, that is designed to help predict sales, fell 11.6% to 81.9 in April, the National Association of Realtors said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales declined in the Midwest, West and South. The South reported the greatest drop, as pending home sales fell 17.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales in the Northeast rose 1.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bad weather may have played a part in last month's decline, analysts said, but the housing market continues to suffer from larger problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tight credit and uncertainty about where the market is headed appear to be holding back buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The pullback in contract signings is disappointing and implies a slower than expected market recovery in upcoming months," said Lawrence Yun, the group's chief economist.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices continued their downward spiral in March as the glut of foreclosures kept a lid on home values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report Wednesday showed activity in the U.S. manufacturing sector cooling in April, as orders for long-lasting goods and a measure of business investment both declined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of home-price declines slowed in March, as an index measuring prices for U.S. homes fell a seasonally adjusted 0.3% after declining 1.5% the month before, the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> said Wednesday. The index is based on sales prices from mortgages by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as the broader economy recovers, improvements in the housing market have been fleeting. A report this week showed new home sales were up 7.3% in April from March. While median prices of new homes have stabilized in recent months, sales volumes remain far below year-ago levels, when tax credits spurred more sales of lower-priced properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This time prices are not being driven down by a plunge in confidence and a sudden contraction in credit," Paul Dales, a Capital Economics analyst wrote in a note to clients. "Instead, they are being depressed by a chronic lack of demand and the effects of many foreclosed sales."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first quarter, home prices were down 2.5%, the largest quarterly decline since late 2008. Home prices have declined 5.5% compared with the first quarter of 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FHFA index, which tracks price changes in sales of existing homes, tends to fall faster when the share of foreclosed property sales rises. Foreclosures often sell at a discount because banks are faster than homeowners to cut prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices ticked up in March in four of the nine Census regions in the FHFA report, led by a 2% increase in the West South Central area, which includes Texas and Louisiana. The steepest decline occurred in the South Atlantic area, where prices fell 2% in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling home prices add another layer of uncertainty to an already-slow economic recovery. Declines tend to unnerve consumers and discourage builders from constructing homes. Dropping prices can also make it more difficult to access financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With little movement in the housing market, sectors such as manufacturing have been the drivers of the economy. But there are signs that factory growth is starting to slow its brisk pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New orders for manufactured durable goods—those designed to last at least three years—fell 3.6% to a seasonally adjusted $189.9 billion in April, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. Shipments also fell 1%. The decline in orders was driven by a drop in demand for aircraft as well as falling orders for autos, likely related to supply-chain disruptions from the earthquake in Japan. Excluding transportation, orders fell 1.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A measure of business investment also ticked down, in a worrisome sign for second-quarter growth. Orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft decreased 2.6% last month after rising 5.4% a month earlier.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A four-plus acre, oceanfront compound in Palm Beach that belonged to Metromedia founder John Kluge has hit the market for $59 million. The seller is Columbia University, to which Mr. Kluge, an alumnus, willed the estate as part of a $400 million gift he made in 2007</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kluge, who died in 2010 at the age of 95, cobbled together the estate over several years. Originally five lots, 'Casa Sin Nombre' has more than 21,000 square feet of living space, including a 12,000-square-foot home. The four other buildings on the property can be used for staff or guests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paulette Koch and Dana Koch of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span> and Carole Digges and Carole Hogan of Brown Harris Stevens, a Christie's International Real Estate affiliate, share the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tommy Hilfiger co-founder Joel Horowitz has cut the $100 million asking price on his Zephyr Cove, Nev. estate to $75 million after nearly five years on the market. 'Tranquility,' a stone mansion on 210 acres, has a staircase modeled on the Titanic's, a cigar lounge and an indoor pool. Total square footage, including seven other structures, is more than 38,000 square feet, and the property has its own private lake and a gym with an indoor basketball court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Horowitz said last fall he felt the property was 'worth every penny' of its original asking. He and his wife Ann, he said, had spent years designing and building the home and had bought items for the home, including fireplace mantels and 400-year-old flooring from French chateaux, on their travels before it was built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shari Chase and Susan Lowe of Chase International share the listing; Ms. Chase said in a statement the new price was 'an amazing value.'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bud and Betsy Knapp, former owners of Architectural Digest and Bon Appetit, are asking nearly $24 million for their home in the Bel-Air neighborhood of Los Angeles. The Knapps bought the property in 1991, tore down the existing house and spent the next several years interviewing architects and building the home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The roughly 15,000-square-foot, Hugh Newell Jacobsen-designed house is made up of 17 distinct 'pavilions,' square limestone buildings connected by long glass hallways and topped by pyramid-shaped roofs.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property borders the Bel-Air Country Club and has a pool, sculpture garden and extensive terrace and deck space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Knapp, 74, says he and his wife are selling to spend the last part of their lives in Colorado, where they have several eco-projects planned.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes posted a 7.1% gain in April from March, raising expectations that the downturn in residential construction could be near a bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New homes sold in April at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 323,000 units. That was an increase from March, but still down 23% from the sales pace of April 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February, new homes were selling at an annual pace of 278,000 units, tying the slowest rate since the Census Bureau began tracking the data in 1963, but sales have risen in the past two months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sale price of a new home also rose in April for the second month in a row, coming in at $217,900, up 4% from the same month last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in sales and prices is partly attributed to falling inventory, which some economists say is leveling out an imbalance between supply and demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But builders are still feeling pressure to slash prices to compete with foreclosures, which typically sell at steep discounts to market value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home inventory, or the number of new residences on the market, fell to 175,000 nationwide in April, the lowest level on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the Census reported that builders are on pace to start 523,000 homes in 2011. In early 2006, the peak of the recent housing boom, builders were putting up homes at a rate of about 2 million a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's likely that we're pretty near the low" for new-home sales, said David Stiff, chief economist for Fiserv Case-Shiller, a home-price research firm. "We're starting to see prices stabilize in some markets, and within those markets, we're seeing the better neighborhoods improve faster, and that includes neighborhoods with good school districts and shorter commutes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report by Metrostudy, which tracks home construction and sales, found that sales and prices are starting to pick up in some suburban communities. "The places where builders are raising prices are situations where all the stars are in alignment," said Brad Hunter, Metrostudy's chief economist. "They're near lots of jobs and entertainment . . . . Gas prices are part of it. If you're too far from where you want to be, the commute hurts."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for properties close to metro areas allowed luxury home builder <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> to raise prices about $2,000 per house in Loudon Valley Villages, an Ashburn, Va., subdivision not far from Northern Virginia's job-rich Dulles Corridor near Washington, D.C. That means four-bedroom town homes in the subdivision now sell for about $332,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Chandler, Ariz., about 25 miles from downtown Phoenix, builder <span class="companylink">Fulton Homes</span> has raised asking prices from an average of $301,700 to $305,233 at the Fulton Ranch community, after a year of keeping them flat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Here in the southeast valley . . . our inventory is way down, so we're actually competing for houses around here," said Nancy Niblett, a real-estate agent who sold a home in Fulton Ranch last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Canyon Springs, a community in Palm Beach County, Fla., builder GL Homes has raised prices by more than $30,000 for some luxury homes. A six-bedroom home that was selling for $394,900 in the second quarter of last year was asking $424,900 at the end of 2010.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Dana Rubinstein Special To The WSJ </div><div>1096 words</div><div>25 May 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Howard Lutnick, chief executive of investment-banking firm <span class="companylink">Cantor Fitzgerald</span>, doesn't just want to join the commercial real-estate game. He wants to change how it is played.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As he moves to finalize the firm's recently announced and surprising purchase of commercial-real-estate brokerage Newmark Knight Frank, Mr. Lutnick is looking for creative ways to combine his traditional business of complicated bond trading with the more prosaic world of square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the big ideas he is studying: developing a market in property derivatives pegged to rents in individual buildings as a way for landlords and tenants to hedge against unexpected market volatility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You know you can hedge orange juice and you can hedge corn, but real estate you can't?" said Mr. Lutnick in a recent interview. "It doesn't make any sense."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether Mr. Lutnick can pull this off, of course, remains to be seen, and there are plenty of Newmark competitors questioning whether it would work. But the idea represents the kind of fresh thinking that Mr. Lutnick plans to introduce into the clubby world of commercial real-estate brokerage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think property derivatives will become a common part of tenants' and landlords' transactions in commercial real estate," Mr. Lutnick said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It took the commercial-property industry and most brokers at Newmark by surprise late last month, when the firm announced it was going to be acquired by <span class="companylink">BGC Partners Inc</span>., a Cantor spinoff that also is headed by Mr. Lutnick. Few non-real-estate companies have attempted acquisitions of real-estate service companies or started businesses, and even fewer have succeeded. <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> both launched office-leasing brokerage firms in the late 1980s but got out of them after the market cratered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, there are no obvious synergies to the deal, which is set to close later this year. BGC was launched in 2004 as a shop in which traders work the phones to put together complicated bond deals and later added <span class="companylink">eSpeed Inc</span>., an electronic-trading business. Newmark is a traditional New York-based real-estate company that, since it was founded in 1925, has made the lion's share of its revenue from trading, leasing and managing office buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think it's still a little bit of a puzzling move," says Patrick O'Shaughnessy, a research analyst at Raymond James. "It's a substantial departure from BGC's normal course of operations."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the lack of overlap was one of the things that appealed to Newmark's executives, including Chief Executive Barry Gosin, Chairman Jeff Gural and PresidentJames Kuhn. They had been eager to figure out a source of capital to expand the firm, sensing opportunity in this turbulent time of real-estate consolidation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But they didn't want to do be acquired or merge with a larger real-estate company that would force scores of layoffs at Newmark, which currently employs about 425 brokers. They also were averse to accepting private-equity money, which typically looks for a relatively short-term return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price wasn't disclosed, but a person familiar with the deal says it involved cash and BGC stock and was valued in the $125 million to $200 million range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It gives us a strong financial partner to continue to grow," said Mr. Gosin, the Newmark CEO, in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, Mr. Lutnick has made a few forays into commercial real estate. In late 2009, at <span class="companylink">Cantor Fitzgerald</span>, he launched a commercial-mortgage-backed-securities underwriting and trading business. And earlier this year, <span class="companylink">BGC Partners</span> teamed up with <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>'s <span class="companylink">LaSalle Investment Management</span> fund-management unit to launch a property-derivatives business in the U.K.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lutnick contends that the commercial-real-estate and bond-trading businesses are a good fit because many of the clients overlap. The financial industry is one of the key users of office space in New York, he noted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, at the end of the day, he said, the job descriptions are fundamentally similar. "In commercial real-estate brokerage, it is a customer service, high-value-relationship-driven business that is very much akin to the brokerage businesses of BGC," Mr. Lutnick said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Cantor Fitzgerald</span> and Mr. Lutnick are best known from the Sept. 11, 2001, tragedy, when the firm lost 658 employees, more than any other World Trade Center tenant. Since then, Mr. Lutnick has slowly rebuilt the firm while continuing to honor the people who died and to support their families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the downturn, Mr. Lutnick's businesses have stayed relatively healthy. Like other niche firms, it has benefitted by the demise of bigger competitors like <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns</span> and <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span>. Besides commercial real estate, he has also expanded into other businesses, like Cantor Gaming, which manufactures and operates gambling systems at places like the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BGC's deal with Newmark comes at a time when the real-estate brokerage business is rebounding from the downturn, which saw an enormous decline in transactions. But even as it is recovering, the industry is going through considerable upheaval. Some of the larger firms, like <span class="companylink">Grubb &amp; Ellis Co</span>., have been struggling, and smaller firms are finding they need to grow to keep up with the demands of corporate tenants with offices throughout the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BGC is still working out the particulars of how the derivatives would work, but Mr. Lutnick predicted that they will be traded as well as used by tenants and landlords to hedge against rent increases and decreases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The broker's job would be to match those individuals as counterparties in a transaction," Mr. Lutnick said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone is convinced that such derivatives would work. They note, for example, that pricing in the office rental market is more amorphous than, say, the market for Treasury bills, so it would be harder to tie a derivatives contract to it. "I think it will certainly be a tough sell," says Gary Rosenberg, a prominent New York real-estate attorney.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Lutnick pointed out that his companies have been pioneers in information technology and that expertise could enable Newmark to pinpoint such metrics as market rents for the purposes of settling derivatives contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newmark's information division "would have enormous technological backing and financial backing," Mr. Lutnick said. "It will be a complete eye opener to our clients."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ian Schrager, the famed boutique hotel pioneer, said on Tuesday that he is close to securing deals to develop five hotels under his new brand Public, which rejects much of the hip hotel-design concepts he helped to popularize more than two decades ago as the founder of <span class="companylink">Morgans Hotel Group Co</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not about being a stylish hotel," he said. "It's really trying to get away from the iconic over-the-top blow-the-customer-away kind of design that people are sick of. It's become a Frankenstein monster and being replicated by companies who don't understand the purpose."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first hotel he plans to open under the Public brand will be in Chicago in October at the Ambassador East, a hotel Mr. Schrager said he purchased for $25 million with <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> two years ago and is renovating at a cost of $35 million. Other deals in the works are two in New York City, one in London and one in Los Angeles, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schrager, 64 years old, who first became known for creating the Studio 54 nightclub in the 1970s, opened his first hotel, Morgan's, in 1984, which helped to usher in a popular new category of hotels with generally small rooms and a focus on high-design and very social lobby spaces, as well as restaurants, spas and nightclubs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For his new venture, he said he drew inspiration primarily from the retail outlets for Apple and <span class="companylink">Trader Joe's</span>, a supermarket that sells specialty products at a discount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drawing on those service-oriented retail trends, he said he is hoping to insert a new stripped-down hotel category called "essential services" into the highly regimented hotel space. Like his earlier boutique concepts, the hotels will feature restaurants, bars and, in some cases, nightclubs, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What I did before was based on exclusivity, and this is inclusive," he said. "This is for everyone that wants it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schrager is simultaneously developing Public and another unnamed brand that he said will be more luxurious but has been more difficult to develop. He is also continuing a partnership with <span class="companylink">Marriott International Inc</span>. to develop Edition, Marriott's boutique-style brand. Introduced just before the economic downturn, Edition has been slow to develop, with just two hotels open. Marriott is investing to open additional hotels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schrager said he learned from Marriott executives how to simultaneously develop multiple hotels in order to launch a brand on a larger scale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Before I did 12 hotels over 20 years," he said. "Now, I hope to have 10 to 15 over five to seven years."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clock Is Ticking For Simon</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mall giant <span class="companylink">Simon Property Group Inc</span>. has an expensive decision to make within the next 90 days on one of its most lucrative malls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Australian property company <span class="companylink">Lend Lease Group</span> has reached a deal to sell its 50% stake in King of Prussia Plaza in King of Prussia, Pa., for a hefty $545 million in cash and assumed debt to a <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> fund. Simon, which owns the other 50% of the property with joint-venture partner Kravco Cos., has a 90-day right of first refusal to match the <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Simon representative declined to comment. Simon, owner of more than 300 U.S. retail properties, manages King of Prussia Plaza.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">King of Prussia Plaza is one of Simon's top-selling malls, with annual sales per square foot of $750. The 2.4 million-square-foot mall is 95% occupied, with shops including <span class="companylink">Neiman Marcus Group</span>, <span class="companylink">Macy's</span>, Burberry and an <span class="companylink">Apple Inc</span>. store.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I would expect Simon to match the offer," says Ben Yang, an analyst with Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods. "King of Prussia is a trophy mall, and opportunities to buy trophies don't come along very often."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kris Hudson</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outlet Center Bubble?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as mall owners rush into the outlet-center industry, some are wondering if the business is getting a little frothy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's definitely the flavor of the month," said Stephen Lebovitz, president and chief executive of mall owner <span class="companylink">CBL &amp; Associates Properties Inc</span>., at the International Council of Shopping Centers' annual leasing conference in Las Vegas on Monday. "Projects will be built, but there will be one in each market. I don't think there will be three in Phoenix or Toronto or anything like that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CBL and a partner are building an outlet center in Oklahoma City. In recent months, <span class="companylink">Tanger Factory Outlet Centers Inc</span>. has teamed up with a Canadian partner to start building an outlet center near Toronto. <span class="companylink">Macerich Co</span>. and <span class="companylink">Simon Property Group Inc</span>. separately have chosen sites for outlet-center sites in the Phoenix market. And Simon on Monday announced it has added its own Canadian partner to build a center near Toronto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We'll probably overbuild them," Greg Maloney, president of brokerage <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>'s retail division, said at the conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are roughly 214 outlet centers in the U.S., with another 40 on the drawing board, according to ICSC. <span class="companylink">Taubman Centers Inc</span>. CEO Robert Taubman is among the sector's fans, predicting that he will build five to 10 outlet centers in the next 10 years. "The demand has not yet been satisfied," he said. "Clearly, more supply can be built."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jeff Bater and Jeffrey Sparshott   </div><div>414 words</div><div>25 May 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>9</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales rose more than expected and the median price climbed in April, but the overall pace remained weak for the battered U.S. sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales increased 7.3% on a monthly basis to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 323,000 in April, the U.S. Commerce Department said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by had forecast sales would remain unchanged at an annual rate of 300,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the unexpected increase, sales have fallen 23.1% since April 2010, which is when a tax subsidy for first-time home buyers ended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales rose 8.3% in March, revised down from a previously estimated 11.1% increase. The March jump followed a February decline that was blamed on the weather as well as fundamental troubles in the housing sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Uncertainty over property prices has made prospective home buyers hesitant to purchase new houses. Lower selling prices weighed down <span class="companylink">Pulte Homes Inc</span>. in its first quarter, with the builder's revenue falling 21%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home construction in April fell sharply, the government reported last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders face competition from previously owned homes, which cost less, and foreclosures caused by the housing bust and the recession have swamped the market with cheap property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for an existing home in the U.S. is $163,700, the latest data show. The median price for a new home, on the other hand, was $217,900 in April, Tuesday's report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year earlier, the median price for a new home was $208,300. The increase was encouraging because prices have been sinking for a long time, making consumers reluctant to buy because of a belief prices might recede further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unsold homes on the market have kept down prices. Tuesday's data showed April inventories were at a record low. But the time it would take to exhaust the supply of unsold homes on the market was 6.5 months in April, above the baseline of six months that economists consider healthy. The supply in March was 7.2 months, and it had been higher last summer, hitting nine months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce report said new-home sales in April rose in all four U.S. regions on a monthly basis. Sales increased 7.7% in the Northeast, 15.1% in the West, 4.9% in the Midwest and 4.3% in the South.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Candace Jackson   </div><div>2783 words</div><div>20 May 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Asia</div><div>AWSJ</div><div>W1</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2011 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This spring, Russian billionaire Yuri Milner paid $100 million for a French chateau-style mansion in Silicon Valley, a deal that set a record for the highest price ever paid for a single-family home in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, Ukraine's Rinat Akhmetov closed on two of London's most expensive apartments ever for a combined $222.5 million. In Paris, a Gulf princess spent $96.9 million last year for a mansion with an inner courtyard, garden and private chapel on the Left Bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the biggest residential real-estate buyers in many cities are emerging from places halfway around the globe. In London, one report finds that 65% of buyers in the luxury market hail from abroad. According to the Miami Association of Realtors, nearly 60% of all sales last year throughout the city were to buyers from foreign countries. About half of the buyers in one new luxury condominium building on Manhattan's tony Fifth Avenue are from overseas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While foreign purchasers make up about 7% of the U.S. residential real-estate market, their numbers have swelled: According to the National Association of Realtors, 18% of Realtors in the U.S. market reported selling a home to at least one international buyer in 2010, up from 12% in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The makeup of these buyers is changing too, reflecting changes in the global economic scene. Buyers from Russia have returned, and the numbers are growing from Brazil, where the economy grew 7.5% last year. Australians are buying ski homes in Aspen. In Tampa, Florida, Venezuelan buyers are buying heavily discounted beach condos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the biggest factors in many areas is the emergence of Chinese buyers. As housing costs on China's mainland skyrocket -- raising concerns of a property bubble there -- some monied buyers are heading overseas, moving into markets that look safer and, in comparison, like a bargain too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Orange County, California, broker Steve High says Chinese buyers now account for more than half of his showings in tony Newport Coast, up from a very small handful two or three years ago. He says many Chinese buyers seek brand-new homes with more than 10,000 square feet to use either for vacations or as a place for their children to live when they attend college. "We have great big houses here, and they're sitting vacant," he says, "Or we have an 18-year-old kid living in the house by himself."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amy Williamson, the vice president of sales for Prodigy Network, which markets condo buildings like Trump Soho Hotel Condominium in New York, visited Shanghai last month, meeting with local brokers and potential buyers there. Beverly Hills-based broker Joyce Rey traveled to Beijing in October, arranging a reception at an art gallery where photographs of homes priced between $10 million and $125 million were displayed around the room like artwork. Tim Swannie, the Valbonne, France, director of Home Hunts, says one of his agents is working with two Chinese clients who are looking for vineyards in the $5 million-to-$10 million range in the Bordeaux region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S., many foreign buyers are taking advantage of the relatively weak dollar. In March, Pascale Saliou, a 44-year-old from Brittany, France, paid about $600,000 for studio in a building with a contemporary art-filled lobby in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood. Ms. Saliou has been visiting the city regularly for more than 20 years and finally decided to buy a New York apartment because of the exchange rate. "We never imagined we could one day do this," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all foreign purchasers are shelling out millions (in the U.S., the median price paid for a home by an overseas buyer was under $220,000, according to the National Association of Realtors). Not all are traveling thousands of miles. Canadians are the largest group of foreign buyers in the U.S. today, representing about 23% of foreign buyers, up from about 17.6% in 2009, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Global property buyers gravitate to a handful of highly specific locales: In London, Russians and people from the Middle East flock to central Knightsbridge, where blocks of sleek condos offer top-of-the-line amenities. In New York, newer condos packed with contemporary design attract foreign buyers. Here's a look at some of the top global real-estate markets for foreign buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, Russian composer Igor Krutoy -- who has recorded more than 100 songs in Russia and collaborated with many of the country's music stars -- made headlines when he and his wife, Olga, purchased a 6,000-square-foot 12th floor condo at the Plaza for $48 million. It was one of the highest prices ever paid for a condo in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Jonathan Miller, CEO of appraisal and consulting firm Miller Samuel, foreign buyers make up 15% to 20% of all home sales in Manhattan. They're particularly strong buyers of thoroughly renovated or newly built condos priced at several million dollars or more. Pamela Liebman, president and CEO of New York-based brokerage <span class="companylink">Corcoran Group</span>, says that in the first quarter of this year, nearly 20% of new condo sales at Corcoran went to foreign buyers. One deal under way includes a group of Asian investors who are buying 13 apartments in a building, each priced between $1.5 million and $2.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan has long one of the most popular markets in the world for international buyers. But the makeup of international buyers has shifted. Gone are the investors from Ireland who were snapping up condos amid the economic boom in their homeland, says Mr. Miller. Today, it's buyers from China and Brazil. In the past 18 months, brokers say Russians -- known during the boom years for making large real-estate purchases in opulent trophy buildings -- have returned after sitting on the sidelines during the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">International buyers tend to gravitate to certain buildings. Luigi Rosabianca, a real-estate lawyer who works with international buyers, says the Andre Balasz-designed William Beaver House in the Financial District is popular with his Latin American clients. "Certain people are attracted to certain energy and aesthetics," he says. At the Sheffield, a 582-unit condo building at Columbus Circle where 28% of sold units have gone to overseas buyers, sales staff now print marketing materials in Mandarin, French, Spanish and Italian.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At midtown's Setai Fifth Avenue Residences, where apartments are priced from $1.2 million to $15 million, about half of the buyers have been from overseas. Giuseppe Rossi, the executive vice president of <span class="companylink">Bizzi &amp; Partners Development</span>, who is originally from Italy, notes that many Italians have purchased apartments there. "We're Italian developers so there's a certain appeal to Italian products and the way we built," he says. Brazilian buyers have also made several purchases there, including Brazilian soccer star Kaka, who recently bought three apartments in the building which he plans to combine, says Mr. Rossi. (Kaka didn't respond to requests for comment.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Giorgio Castro, a 62-year-old Rome-based entrepreneur, says he dreamed of owning a place in Manhattan for decades. Last year, with the euro-dollar exchange rate giving him more than a 40% discount, he finally snagged a $1.3 million one-bedroom condo in a Wall Street building designed by David Rockwell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was a good opportunity to buy something I longed for," says Mr. Castro. "With the money I spent, I could not have bought something equivalent in Rome."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Liam Bailey, head of residential research at real-estate agent <span class="companylink">Knight Frank</span>, London's ratio of international to domestic buyers for prime real estate is the highest of any major city in the world -- 64% of buyers of central London homes priced over $8.1 million (GBP 5 million) are foreign, Mr. Bailey says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of nationalities represented has also swelled; 61 nationalities purchased homes in London last year, up from 46 in 2009, with Russian, Chinese, Indian and Middle Eastern buyers seeing the biggest growth, according to <span class="companylink">Knight Frank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many, the U.K.'s steady political environment and stable economy make London a safe haven for wealth. Sterling's decline against the dollar -- around 20% since 2008 -- makes property even more enticing. But currency arbitrage and safe-haven status aside, different nationalities are drawn by different aspects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For U.S. buyers, it's London's leafy Hampstead Village, according to Marcus Oliver, associate director at real-estate agent Chesterton Humbert's Hampstead office. He said 80% of foreign buyers in Hampstead over the past three months have been from the U.S. "Americans are attracted to the quintessentially 'London village' feel of Hampstead, with its quaint Victorian houses and the rolling Heath. It matches up with the cliched impression of London."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the status of a pad in central Knightsbridge are luring the newly monied Eastern Europeans and Middle Eastern buyers, says Roarie Scarisbrick of <span class="companylink">HSBC</span>-owned agent <span class="companylink">Property Vision</span>. Properties like the Knightsbridge, One Hyde Park and the Lancasters, where residents enjoy 24-hour security and amenities ranging from golf simulators to private movie theaters, are attracting some of the world's wealthiest oligarchs and sheiks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In neighboring Kensington, with its proximity to museums and coffee shops, the typical buyer is French, Swiss or Italian, says independent search agent Charles McDowell. He recently found a home for 38-year-old Parisian Michelle Dellion, in South Kensington. The five-bedroom townhouse on Mulberry Walk cost $16.3 million (GBP 10 million) and has 5,000 square feet of living space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mindful of this tendency to flock together, developers have launched targeted marketing drives. Within the last six months, luxury London developments The Heron, Bramah Chelsea, Wellington House and Neo Bankside have held marketing exhibitions in Singapore and Hong Kong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Tara Loader Wilkinson</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PARIS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Paris real-estate market is booming, driven in part by the high prices foreigners are willing to pay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the "Golden Triangle" -- the tony area near the Champs-Elysees -- apartment prices rose 38% in the last year, according to the Paris Notary Chamber. For Paris apartments costing over $2.8 million (2 million euros), three foreigners buy into the market for every one foreign seller, says Charles-Marie Jottras, president of the Daniel Feau network of real-estate agencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jottras just closed his first deal with a Chinese buyer, an apartment on the luxurious Avenue George V for $14.2 million (10 million euros). The six-bedroom apartment, down the street from the Chinese embassy, features a 2,150-square-foot living room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new influx of Chinese buyers is also looking at the 16th arrondissement near the Trocadero Place, where stately buildings appeal to foreign buyers. The Brazilian presence is also growing; Jean-Philippe Roux, manager of luxury real-estate agency John Taylor's new Paris office, says he has nine Brazilians interested in the seventh and eighth arrondissements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">France's neighbors Italy and Britain account for about a third of the international market. These buyers often seek apartments on the Left Bank, in the Saint-Germain neighborhood, as well as in the more bohemian Marais area because of the central location for train stations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russian and Middle Eastern buyers tend to concentrate in the "Golden Triangle," where there are the most luxurious hotels and boutiques. A 1960s-era building at 12-18 Avenue Montaigne, near the Louis Vuitton and Chanel stores, is a big draw, as is the recently renovated building at number 51-53 on the opposite side of the street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Christina Passariello</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HONG KONG</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's housing boom spilled over to Hong Kong, where property prices have surpassed record highs and are now among the highest in the world. According to property agency Savills, Hong Kong's homes are 52% more expensive than London's, and 111% more than New York's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April 2011, a 5,636-square-foot condo at 39 Conduit Rd. in the Mid-Levels district sold for $46.4 million (HK$361 million). Local newspaper Ming Pao reported that it was bought by Shi Yuzhu, Shanghai-based founder of online gaming company Giant Interactive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mainland Chinese buyers are more concentrated in the new luxury sector of condos priced over $1.5 million (HK$12 million), like the Cullinan in West Kowloon. In this sector, they represented 28.8% of the deals during the last half of 2010. In the ultra-expensive range -- $25.7 million (HK$200 million) and above -- Joseph Tsang, managing director at Jones Lang Lasalle in Hong Kong, estimates that almost all the transactions involve buyers from China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tsang says Chinese buyers look for luxury finishes, ornate decorations and grand hotel-style lobbies. "They're into glamour and bling," he says. "In order to attract the Chinese buyer [from the mainland], you need to put out the most expensive stuff on display."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past, the pricey homes along the southern coast of Hong Kong island were popular among well-heeled expatriate bankers from the U.K., Australia and the U.S. But the influx of Chinese buyers and the resulting spike in prices has even forced some members of this wealthy class out of their traditional stomping grounds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city's largest brokers routinely organize bus tours for interested buyers from mainland China to visit new development sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local brokerage firm Midland Realty recently organized three tours during the May 1 weekend, a public holiday. By the end of the weekend, the agency had 10 deals signed, starting at $643,000 (HK$5 million) for new condos. During a tour earlier this year, the agency says some buyers purchased units for $1.3 million (HK$10 million) on their first visit to Hong Kong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you look at the new apartments [in West Kowloon], over 60% are mainland Chinese buyers, but if you count the lights at night, you won't see many. It's sold out, but it's pitch dark," Mr. Tsang says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Jason Chow</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MIAMI</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Greater Miami area, nearly 60% of all sales last year were to buyers from overseas, according to the Miami Association of Realtors. For sales of newly built condos downtown, that figure jumps to 90%, says the group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the buyers are from Brazil, which experienced an economic growth rate of 7.5% last year. Brazil's currency, the real, has risen about 40% against the U.S. dollar in the last two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property developer and marketer <span class="companylink">Fortune International</span> focused heavily on Brazil to sell Jade Ocean, a 50-story building the company is marketing with infinity pools, a private movie theater and a children's playroom decorated with Philippe Starck furniture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its two-story penthouse loft apartments sold for between $3.5 million and $10 million. Nearly 85% of Jade Ocean's sales have gone to overseas buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fortune's principal developer Edgardo Defortuna says that last fall, he worked with <span class="companylink">American Airlines</span> to invite a group of potential buyers and <span class="companylink">American Airlines</span> contacts to a dinner party at an upscale restaurant in Brasilia. "The Black Eyed Peas were having dinner in the next room," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russian buyers tend to cluster in northern, beachfront areas. Mr. Defortuna says he's planning a trip to Moscow and St. Petersburg to pitch several of his Miami-area buildings. There, he hopes to throw a dinner party with Donald Trump Jr.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike Americans, who tend to look for single-family homes, overseas buyers favor condos. Italians have been drawn to the Capri South Beach, a condo building with downtown views and its own marina, says broker Nelson Gonzalez. The Icon Brickell, a three-tower complex downtown, has a large number of British and Brazilian owners, says Oliver Ruiz, a managing broker with Fortune International Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Venezuelans are also a growing presence, as are buyers from Italy, Spain and Switzerland. Phillip Yaffa, an owner of the Miami office of Engel &amp; Volkers, says a waterfront home sold last week for $9.4 million to a Swiss buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Henrik Wiingaard-Madsen, a shoe-manufacturing company owner from Denmark, says he got a 30% discount in July for two apartments in the Icon Brickell -- $520,000 for a two-bedroom and $840,000 for a three-bedroom -- plus a rebate. Icon "had so many units, they were kind of desperate at the time," he says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of American households behind on mortgage payments hovered at its lowest level in nearly two years during the first quarter, but the number of borrowers in foreclosure stayed near record high levels, the Mortgage Bankers Association said on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, sales of previously owned homes declined in April, further underscoring the challenges facing a troubled U.S. housing sector that has limped along since home-buyer tax credits ended last summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The MBA reported that 12.8% of mortgage loans on one-to-four-unit homes were 30 days or more delinquent or in the foreclosure process as of March 31, representing more than 6.2 million households. That was down from 14% one year ago and 12.9% at the end of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of borrowers that are seriously delinquent—meaning they have missed three or more payments—has now declined for five straight quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're looking at a market on the mend. We're not healed yet but things are looking better than they did certainly in the year before," said Jay Brinkmann, the MBA's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the report underscored the fragility of those gains. After adjusting for seasonal factors, the report found that the number of newly delinquent loans ticked up slightly in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the National Association of Realtors reported that existing home sales fell 0.8% in April from March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.05 million, a sign of a "very sluggish housing recovery," said NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun. The median sales price fell 5% to $163,700 from $172,300 a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventory of homes for sale climbed at the end of April to 3.87 million. At the current sales pace, it would take 9.2 months to sell those homes, compared to an 8.3-month supply in March. A healthy level would be about six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High foreclosure inventories remain one of the biggest threats to a housing recovery, particularly in light of anemic demand. Nearly 2.2 million households are in foreclosure, according to the MBA survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Anyone hoping for a sustained recovery in the housing market is not going to find it," said real estate professor Christopher Mayer of Columbia Business School. Given the heavy volume of foreclosures that tend to sell at discounted prices, "it's hard to predict anything but more declines in prices," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>'s chief economist Doug Duncan said rising gas prices and increased costs of loans from the Federal Housing Administration may be weighing on the overall real estate market. "All those small things can make for a significant percentage change," he said. "You just never know how they factor into buyers' perceptions."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks initiated fewer repossessions during the first quarter than at any time since the end of 2008, according the MBA data. The nation's largest banks have had to overhaul their foreclosure processes after signs that they were improperly preparing foreclosure paperwork last fall, which has sharply curtailed foreclosures in many states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data show how foreclosure inventories remain elevated largely as a result of a handful of states that have struggled to deal with a glut of foreclosures. Florida accounts for 24% of all loans in foreclosure for the country as a whole, and nearly one in seven borrowers in the state are in some stage of foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The states with the biggest increases in foreclosure inventories—Florida, New Jersey, and Illinois—require banks to process foreclosures through courts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California and Arizona have also faced unprecedented levels of soured loans, but foreclosure inventories are down from peak levels. Those states don't require foreclosures to move through the court system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You have to think regionally now, not nationally," said Fannie's Mr. Duncan. Judicial backlogs "will affect markets, particularly if they are not seeing strength in employment."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greece Seeks Salvation in Privatization</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Could Greece's tragedy yet have a happy ending?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many investors think the country has little chance of avoiding a default at some point. Its slim hopes of avoiding that depend on an ambitious 50 billion euro ($71 billion) privatization and real-estate development program by 2015, with 12 billion euros to 17 billion euros of receipts now promised by 2013. Wednesday's announcement of a raft of advisers for privatizations ranging from gambling companies to motorways suggests it may finally be serious. Still, execution risk remains high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greece has no shortage of assets. It has state-owned enterprises alone valued at 44 billion euros, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. These include ports, power, transport, water and gambling companies. In addition, the government owns real estate with an estimated value of 200 billion euros to 300 billion euros, including 2004 Olympics facilities, military property and land used for uncontrolled private development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But despite commitments given to the International Monetary Fund and European Commission, Greece has been dragging its feet. Unlike the U.K. privatizations in the 1980s, Greece seems likely to have to sell mostly to foreign investors rather than to its own public, heightening the sensitivities. But attitudes are changing: A recent poll showed more than seven in 10 Greeks support privatization. The Socialist government can count on support from the right-wing opposition for asset sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The challenge now is to find investors willing to put money into Greece. Spain's Gas Natural has indicated it may bid for a stake in gas company DEPA; Athens International Airport also looks set to draw international interest, though the deal's value will depend on the terms of a new concession agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hurdles remain. Financial buyers may find it difficult to borrow against Greek assets. And on the real-estate side, progress may be slow. Even now, Greece is only just establishing a single land registry; its banks are cataloguing its real-estate assets; and the country is having to develop surface rights and long-term leaseholds. Conditions for developers remain unclear. Yet Greece is relying on real estate to generate 35 billion euros of the 50 billion euro target. This is hugely ambitious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the prize is worth it. If it does raise 50 billion euros -- equivalent to 20% of gross domestic product -- Greece's debt-to-GDP would fall to 134% in 2015 from a current forecast of 151%, according to the IMF, and its debt would be on a clear downward trajectory. That estimate excludes other economic benefits, including increased foreign investment elsewhere in the economy, higher productivity and the opportunity to buy back debt at sky-high yields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What Greece is confronting is nothing less than a Thatcher-style revolution. But the comparison is a reminder that what is promised is achievable -- providing one has a Thatcher.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">London Property Scene's Gold Dust</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The London property gold rush shows little sign of flagging. Prime office values have soared more than 30% from June 2009's lows and yields average 5.25%, close to precrisis levels. Now <span class="companylink">Land Securities</span>, the U.K.'s largest real-estate investment trust, says rents are rising, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while London is booming, there is little to cheer elsewhere in the U.K. commercial real-estate market. Investors need to approach the sector with care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">London has had a remarkable run, largely driven by overseas investors looking for relatively liquid, safe-harbor assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rent rises add juice to the story: <span class="companylink">Land Securities</span> on Wednesday said rents rose 4.7% across its portfolio, helping it deliver a near-20% increase in net asset value in the year ended in March, well ahead of analyst expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That could be just the beginning. Long leases on older office blocks barely modernized since the 1990s are soon to expire, potentially fueling tenant demand at a time when London faces a shortage of new space. The squeeze could boost rents to almost GBP 60, or $97, a square foot by year end from GBP 55 a square foot in the first quarter, forecasts property adviser DTZ.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside London, it is a different story: Lower-quality secondary assets are still valued 40% below precrisis levels and may have further to fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Lloyds Banking Group</span> and <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Scotland Group</span> have almost GBP 70 billion in U.K. commercial real-estate exposure that they need to offload. Ireland's National Asset Management Agency holds a further GBP 10 billion, which it plans to reduce 25% by 2013; other borrowers may try to sell ahead of refinancing deadlines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With its primary focus on high quality, London real estate, <span class="companylink">Land Securities</span> is largely insulated against these risks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite an 18% rise this year, the shares still trade at a 4% discount to its March 2011 net asset value. With plans to build 4.4 million square feet of London space to take advantage of rising rents and strong investment demand, that looks cheap.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's Growth</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prospects</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worried about Chinese growth? Here is another reason: high inventories mean that if demand weakens, output could fall even faster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory cycle amplifies manufacturing's ups and downs. When demand is strong, businesses step up output and add to inventories, giving growth an extra boost. When demand falters, producers go slow and reduce inventories, giving growth an extra kick in the teeth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 2008 crisis, the global collapse in demand spurred businesses to cease production and sell down inventories, exacerbating the economic impact. When growth started to get back on track in 2009, restocking gave it an extra boost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The process is the same in China. But it is even tougher to find good inventories data than in other countries. What information there is points to high levels of inventory that will damp growth if final demand slows in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data from the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing show additions to manufacturers' stock of finished goods in March and April, unusual because the data normally point to falls in inventory. Calculations by Wang Tao, an expert on the Chinese economy at <span class="companylink">UBS</span>, show that in key parts of the industrial sector, the ratio of inventory to sales has returned close to precrisis levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The outlook for demand is tough to call. But there are reasons for concern. Growth in industrial value added was 13.4% year-on-year in April, from 14.8% in March. Real-estate investment remains robust, but a drop in construction because of government controls and oversupply is widely expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The joker is inflation. If a moderating consumer-price index means an end to tightening monetary policy, growth should bounce back and worries about the inventory cycle recede. But if inflation remains high, and policy tilted toward tightening, high inventories will amplify any slowdown in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Tom Orlik</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overheard</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The north-south divide couldn't be more stark. As Greece wrestles with slow privatizations and markets bet that some kind of debt restructuring or bond exchange will take place, Swedish debt managers are wrangling with the opposite -- and rather more welcome -- problem. Partly thanks to high privatization receipts, Sweden is forecast to have budget surpluses of 99 billion Swedish kronor ($15.7 billion) in 2011 and 68 billion kronor in 2012. But that means debt issuance is declining sharply. Government debt is forecast to fall to 30% of GDP in 2011 and to 27% in 2012. That makes it difficult to maintain liquidity in benchmark bonds. So the Swedish debt office will be offering a restructuring, of the positive kind, to let investors roll exposure into bonds that mature in 2022. It should have no trouble drumming up demand for that deal.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing markets could sure use some good news.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales out Thursday may provide a modicum of it. Analysts expect data from the National Association of Realtors to show that closed sales of existing homes in April rose about 2% from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of about 5.2 million units. While that is still down from the 5.8 million pace of April 2010, last year's figures were goosed by the home buyers' tax credit. That incentive did little more than pull sales forward; once it expired, they slumped to a 3.86 million trough in July 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest figures should provide a clearer picture of real sales activity. But as positive as that may be, there still isn't much to cheer about.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For starters, pending home sales, which typically lead closings by a month or two, rose 5.1% in March. That would imply that Thursday's figures could show growth of even more than 2%; anything below that consensus number will be particularly disappointing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real test comes later this month with the next round of pending-sales figures, for April, showing contract activity in the clutch spring selling season. Economists expect those signings to drop by about 2%, partly due to bad weather. Another potential factor: On April 18, premiums increased for mortgage insurance provided by the Federal Housing Administration. That likely led to higher demand for homes in March and early April, noted economists at IHS Global Insight. "This surge will result in higher closings in April, and possibly also in May, followed by a sharp drop-off," they wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So unless contract signings post a strong rebound in May, it is tough to see how housing will get up off the mat. And this doesn't bode well for prices. If sellers can't unload homes during the spring, they will be more inclined to aggressively cut prices. That, along with the wave of distressed properties still coursing through markets, may mean that any 2011 price drops are more severe than expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling mortgage rates, which averaged 4.63% last week, may be an offset. But they alone won't counter still-high unemployment. Until that improves markedly, and the huge inventory of unsold homes declines, investors should beware any housing head fakes.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home construction fell last month as a slowly growing economy has yet to revive the moribund housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of homes and apartments dropped 10.6% in April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 523,000, compared with a month earlier, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. Home starts are down 23.9% from the same month a year ago, reflecting a market that has struggled as foreclosures drive down prices and builders face financing difficulties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's flat at the bottom," said Patrick Newport, an IHS Global Insight economist. "It's not getting any worse, it's not getting any better."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family home building declined last month, falling 5.1% to an annual rate of 394,000. Construction was down in most of the U.S. last month, falling in the South, Midwest and West. In the Northeast, though, single-family home building rose 12.8%. Compared with the same period last year, new single-family home starts were down 30.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of multifamily housing with at least five units, which tends to be more volatile, plunged 28.3% last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Measures of future construction offered little hope of a quick turnaround. Building permits fell 4% to an annual rate of 551,000. Permits for single-family homes dropped 1.8%. Permits for multifamily structures with at least five units declined 13.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists predict the housing market is in for a slow recovery. Government incentives, such as the first-time home-buyer tax credit, helped home sales last year. But since its expiration, the housing market has faltered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, it will take stronger income and job growth to inspire more families to purchase homes, working through the inventory that accumulated during the downturn. In the meantime, residential construction is likely to weigh on the economic expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the housing market sputters, other U.S. industries are recovering. A semiannual survey of purchasing and supply executives in manufacturing and service industries showed both expected higher revenue and increased hiring this year, the Institute for Supply Management said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturers were more optimistic, as executives predicted revenue would rise 7.5% this year. That's an improvement from their forecast in December, when they expected revenue to increase 5.6%. Hiring is expected to increase 2.9% through the rest of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Service executives expected more subdued growth, forecasting a 2.1% increase in revenue this year, down from their earlier prediction of a 3.4% rise. Employment is expected to rise 0.9% for the rest of 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Price increases and slow employment growth are prominent areas of concern in the non-manufacturing sector," Anthony Nieves, head of the nonmanufacturing survey committee, said in a release.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CINCINNATI—For a place that's been empty for five decades, the grand old home of Ivory soap's inventor, James Norris Gamble, is seeing a lot of action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nonprofit group funded by the Gamble family fortune is trying to tear it down. An irregular band of amateur local historians and neighbors is trying to save it. All the while, termites are eating it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the past year, the two sides have been warring over the Victorian home—nestled on a 22-acre property here—in the streets, in court, at Cincinnati city council meetings and on Internet discussion boards. The loose-knit group trying to save the property has won some important battles, but a number of appeals are wending their way through county and federal courts. Most of them ultimately could grant the Gamble group, the Greenacres Foundation, a demolition permit. The latest appeals will be heard in county court Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are dealing with a national treasure," said Gregory Kissel, an ardent Gamble historian who often tops off his full-time work as an architect with 40-hour weeks to save the home, and who helped get it designated a local historic landmark. "There's an intrinsic value to this home that goes beyond just dollars and cents. This is our history."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Defenders of historic homes beyond Cincinnati are watching closely, worried the historic landmark designation could be undermined. "We don't want to set a precedent that these ordinances can be ignored when certain people don't want them to be enforced," said Royce Yeater, the Midwest director for the National Trust for Historic Preservation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the mounting public pressure, Greenacres is determined to take the home down, arguing that it is in irreversible disrepair and would be too expensive to fix. The foundation, which focuses on conservation and culture, has a net worth of $249 million, according to tax filings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greenacres wants to turn the property into an outdoor education center. It plans to rebuild some of the Gamble rooms inside a barn, which is in better condition than the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gamble was born in Cincinnati in 1836. His father had helped launch <span class="companylink">Procter &amp; Gamble Co</span>., today the world's biggest consumer-products company. Mr. Gamble joined his father's company as a young man, fascinated by the chemistry behind soap and candle making. In 1879, his experiments with a pure, white floating soap, strong enough to clean laundry but gentle enough for bathing, helped transform <span class="companylink">P&amp;G</span> from a regional player to a national one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, his home, prized by architects for its fixtures, has fallen deeper and deeper into disrepair. The roof leaks, the foundation sags, the paint peels and termites eat through structural beams. The furniture, ornate woodwork and other fixtures have been removed to protect them. Much of this now sits in the property's barn, including Mr. Gamble's eight-nozzle shower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neighbors, afraid Greenacres will try to sneak the demolition past them, keep watch over the house. Jan Peak lives next to it and spies on it from the cover of a large oak tree in her backyard, with a city official's number on hand in case she detects any suspicious activity. She is going on high alert this week as the court cases move forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My dogs help, too," Ms. Peak said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greenacres is headed by 99-year-old Louise Nippert, one of the wealthiest women in Cincinnati. Ms. Nippert's husband, Louis Nippert, was Mr. Gamble's grandson. The Nipperts founded Greenacres in 1988 and converted their estate and surrounding gardens into a cultural and environmental-education center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Gamble House, which is thought to have been constructed in the 1830s or 1840s, stayed in James Norris Gamble's immediate family for about 90 years. When his daughter, the last full-time resident, died in 1961, it passed to Mr. Nippert. His careful care of the property ended with his death in 1992.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home remained in Ms. Nippert's possession until 2009, when she passed it to Greenacres with the stipulation that it be demolished, according to Carter Randolph, executive vice president of Greenacres. Mr. Randolph said Ms. Nippert, a member of Greenacres' board, declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Efforts to save the house began in January of last year, when Bob Prokop, a Web developer and amateur historian, spotted hints of a plan to demolish the property on a site that lists violations of municipal code, including one against the Gamble property for peeling paint and broken sidewalks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That was when I sounded the alarm," Mr. Prokop said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That's when all hell broke loose," said Mr. Randolph. He sees the battle as a test of individual property rights, a point he underscored by handing a reporter a pocket-size Constitution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cincinnati's history buffs banded together. They wrote letters to city officials, worked the courts to block the demolition permit and marched in picket lines carrying bars of Ivory soap. "If you've used Ivory soap, you know Mr. Gamble!" protesters hollered. One sign read: "Greenacres: NOT the Place to Be."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They set up a <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> group called "Save the Historic Gamble Estate NOW!" and have attracted nearly 3,000 members. "It's like an obsession," Mr. Prokop said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house lacked a specific landmark designation until last spring, when city officials unanimously supported zoning it as a local historic landmark. City Councilman Charlie Winburn distributed bars of Ivory soap to fellow members so they could wash themselves clean if they voted the wrong way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greenacres has fought the landmark designation, an issue that will come up in county court Wednesday, as it disputes the city's denial of a demolition permit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Preservationists have tried to buy the home for as much as $250,000, but Greenacres wants $10 million—$2 million for the home and $8 million to endow it—plus a detailed plan for its future use. Mr. Randolph said that the price was based on estimates from preservation experts and that he has dismissed some offers because they were contingent on fund raising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're confident we can raise the funds, but only if we have an agreement with Greenacres in place," said Paul Muller, executive director of the Cincinnati Preservation Association, which has made offers to buy the home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Procter &amp; Gamble</span> has tried to steer clear of the fight. It said it would consider donating to the Gamble house's preservation, but a spokesman said the company "supports the role that [Greenacres] plays in respecting the wishes of the family that endowed it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather than maintain a grand, walled estate like other corporate giants of the time, Mr. Gamble, an active philanthropist, lived for some 60 years in his relatively simple Victorian home. Advocates for its preservation say if the house had featured more grandiose architecture, they might have had an easier time preserving it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He is an extraordinary figure whose modesty and humanity is, ironically, being used to dismiss the importance of his lifelong home when in fact it illustrates it," Mr. Muller said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lavish home of Cincinnati's yeast titan is faring much better. Greenacres funded a $7 million overhaul of the Julius Fleischmann estate, turning it into an arts education center and space for corporate events and wedding receptions that opened in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Randolph, pointing to the damaged siding of the Gamble house, said the two homes aren't comparable. "Every place you see here you see wood," he said. "At the Fleischmann house you have stone walls. Some of the slate must be close to an inch thick."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, the matter may be resolved by the insects and the elements. Time is not on the home's side. This year a local newspaper ran the headline "At Gamble House, Is It Demolition by Neglect?"</p>

"At that time, most foreign brokerage analysts were negative because Kia had been a chronic problem child of <span class="companylink">Hyundai Motor Group</span>," said Mr. Rana, noting that he was one of few analysts to put a positive rating on the stock early in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">&lt;b&gt;2011 outlook:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyundai Motor Group, because of robust car demand in the U.S. and in emerging markets like Russia and Brazil.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">&lt;b&gt;Best pick of 2010:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"We were bullish on PSU banks since the start of 2010 due to robust growth outlook, improved outlook on profitability and moderating concerns on asset quality. We initiated coverage on the PSU banks with a positive view. Our top call was <span class="companylink">Canara Bank</span>, which we upgraded from hold to buy in July. The return from the stock was 64% based on the closing price on Dec. 31, and based on the max price achieved by the stock during the year the return was 108%."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">&lt;b&gt;Worst pick of 2010:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"We initiated on IOB with a hold rating and maintained it throughout, even though the stock performed well mainly due to improving asset quality outlook. But given the higher restructured assets, we mainatained our hold rating with a relative underperform versus bankex."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">&lt;b&gt;2011 outlook:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Outlook for calendar year 2011 and fiscal year 2012 remains mixed. Fiscal year 2011 saw banks' margins peaking and with a sharper rise in deposit rates at the later part of 2010. However, lower pension-related costs and lower credit costs will keep the earnings growth momentum relatively healthy and banks should realize an earnings growth of 18% to 30% depending on individual banks."</p>

We spotted the tightening liquidity situation ahead of others, which led to the sell-off."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">&lt;b&gt;Worst pick of 2010:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hold on SBI during May to September 2010 on concerns of rising bad loans. "The stock did very well during this period as bad loans recognition was delayed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">&lt;b&gt;2011 outlook:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The next two to three months will be muted as rising inflation and rising interest rates do not augur well for banks.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">&lt;b&gt;Best pick of 2010:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I think my best call during 2010 was to buy Orix. We believed that Orix would come out of crisis mode and their business condition would normalize in 2010. As expected, the company's steady improvement in credit costs (-56% year-on-year) along with its management's focus on overseas growths, led to a consistent outperformance of its share price."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">&lt;b&gt;Worst pick of 2010:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I think my worst call during 2010 was neutral on Credit Saison. The company's initial guidance was too pessimistic and the company revised its guidance in both the second and third quarters, along with the fall of excess interest reimbursement claims. I thought that the investors' expectations would improve for the short term, however the recovery continued toward March 2011. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">&lt;b&gt;2011 outlook:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"We expect the recovery in capex in 2011, considering the historically high level of savings in the corporate sector. Although the earthquake in March 2011 and the possible electricity shortage posed a huge uncertainty, we still believe that there will be an increase in capex demand for restoration in the latter half of 2011. Another key theme for 2011 is the fiscal expansion for reconstruction of lost infrastructure and production capacities. If the government increases JGB issuance without too much of a tax hike, this is likely to reduce the high level of corporate savings and to increase the long-term interest rate. This will become a positive scenario for life insurance companies, particularly Dai-ichi Life."</p>

In the fourth quarter of 2010, the policies of reducing carbon emissions and of energy conservation would end in China. During that time, most of local Chinese governments limited the supply of electricity. I expected the price of steel would raise significantly, and I suggested to overweight Chung Hung Steel during that time. However, the supply of steel increased dramatically after the steel price went up. Further, the demand of steel was not strong in the fourth season. Therefore, the steel price only went up for one month, and then dropped, which was out of my expectation. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">&lt;b&gt;2011 outlook:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"For the Taiwanese steel industry, companies cannot gain excess profit like what they did before 2007. Therefore, I recommend trading buy in this industry. I think we can buy stocks when steel prices go up dramatically in the very short-term. For the Taiwanese airline industry, I think the price of oil will keep above USD$100. Although Taiwanese airlines can benefit from the global economic recovery and the Taiwan-China direct air route, the high oil cost will eat the profit of airlines...so, I will maintain a neutral recommendation for the Taiwanese airline industry."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Eliot Brown   </div><div>649 words</div><div>16 May 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A22</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The estate of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc</span>. is looking to sell its stake in the former International Toy Center building, seeking an exit from a property that has ridden the rocky ups and downs of the Manhattan real-estate market in the past four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank and partner L&amp;L Holding Co. paid $480 million in May 2007 for the mostly vacant 800,000-square-foot building at 200 Fifth Ave. It subsequently saw its value plummet with the market through 2009 to the point where it was viewed to be worth less than its mortgage of approximately $390 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Manhattan office market has improved significantly since, and the owners signed multiple new tenants last year. Now the failed investment bank believes its equity stake -- roughly 90%, according to people familiar with the matter -- has significant value above the debt once again. L&amp;L, led by David Levinson, intends to stay in the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planned equity sale by the Lehman estate marks an uncommon real-estate disposition by the bank, whose assets are being overseen by restructuring firm <span class="companylink">Alvarez &amp; Marsal</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lehman sought bankruptcy protection in 2008 and its estate has generally been reticent to sell off the billions in real-estate debt and equity positions in a bet that the market would improve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many cases, Lehman has even put new money into its assets in an attempt to salvage value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, for example, Lehman asked for court permission to invest an additional $25 million in 25 Broad Street, an incomplete condominium conversion project, and 45 Broad Street, a development site. The bank was the lender on the two adjacent properties in Lower Manhattan, and has filed to foreclose on both properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lehman now points to 200 Fifth, which used to primarily house toy firms, manufacturers and showrooms, as a vindication of its approach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeff Fitts, an <span class="companylink">Alvarez &amp; Marsal</span> managing director, said in a statement that the building is "a perfect example of how actively stabilizing our real-estate assets in lieu of selling in a down market has made sense."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm's stake is being marketed by brokerage Eastdil Secured.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Lehman and L&amp;L bought the building, they put more than $120 million into a renovation in an attempt to reposition the property, which was built around 1909.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They signed one tenant, the Grey Group, for 370,000 square feet in the property, before the economy soured in 2008, leaving most of the building's space unspoken for and not producing income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building's fortunes shifted last year when <span class="companylink">Tiffany &amp; Co</span>. signed a lease to take 260,000 square feet of space. The building is now more than 80% leased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, there has been a surprisingly fast rebound of prices paid for Manhattan office buildings, as investors are focusing their money on major cities considered safe long-term investments, such as New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Lehman's portfolio has benefited from this, the bank, which had one of the most active real-estate divisions on Wall Street at the market's peak, has other real-estate investments scattered around Manhattan that are still troubled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just across the street from 200 Fifth Ave., for instance, Lehman financed the purchase of 1107 Broadway, a 16-story building that Tessler Developments bought in 2007. Tessler had planned to convert that building, which was also part of the former International Toy Center, to luxury condos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lehman has filed a foreclosure action against the property claiming that Tessler failed to repay a $137 million loan in 2008 as the financing markets shut down. The bank has scheduled a foreclosure auction for June 6, according to a public notice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representatives of Tessler didn't respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Oakville, Calif., estate of Maria Manetti Farrow, an entrepreneur and philanthropist who splits her time between Oakville and San Francisco, has hit the market for $35.8 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nearly 60-acre property, in the Napa Valley, is known as the Villa Mille Rose. It comprises three separate parcels and has 43 acres of vineyards, an organic olive orchard and rose gardens.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is nearly five years since the peak of the housing bubble in the U.S., and that highly leveraged sector, with its $11 trillion in residential mortgage debt, continues to struggle. Home values just posted their biggest quarterly decline since late 2008, largely due to a steady stream of foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if we consider that the housing bubble inflated from roughly 1999 to 2006, that made seven fat years. An ancient authority would suggest that seven lean years should follow. That would mean two more lean years to go -- not a bad prediction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actually, what we experienced was a double bubble: one in housing and a parallel one in commercial real estate, which has mortgage debt of $2.4 trillion. Both of these sectors used the opening years of the new century to run up leverage and asset prices to an unsustainable 90% increase, with housing peaking in the second quarter of 2006, and commercial real estate in the fourth quarter of 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The causes of the housing bubble -- subprime mortgages, adjustable-rate mortgages, government-mandated loans, etc. -- are well known. The role of traditional lending by the heavily regulated banking system in the commercial real-estate bubble has received less attention, yet its toll in subsequent bank failures is apparent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inevitable bust brought a national price drop of 32% from the peak for housing, and an even steeper 42% drop from the peak for commercial real estate. These erased trillions of dollars of illusory bubble "wealth." The combined drop in market values was greater than $8 trillion -- that's more than the GDP of China last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why did house prices in the U.S. fall proportionally less than commercial real-estate prices after they both inflated to the same extent? In part, at least, this reflects large government programs and subsidies to support house prices. But even with this support, the asset prices on which huge amounts of debt had been built shriveled, leaving the debt under water. As an old banker told me long ago, "Just remember this, young man: Assets shrink -- liabilities never shrink!" The credit markets for housing and commercial real estate obviously did not remember this classic principle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We all know too well the result: huge defaults, losses, TARP and more than 350 bank failures -- not to mention the failures of government-sponsored enterprises <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. Even this long after the peaks of the double bubble, much of the debt overhang -- or better, hangover -- remains to be worked through. The industrial sector has recovered and is growing, with strong profits, cash build-ups, and a bull market in stocks. But the huge real-estate debt hangover continues to weigh down overall economic performance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps with some poetic justice, this is the inverse of the situation in the early 2000s, after the collapse of the tech-stock bubble. Then we had an industrial recession and the deflationary pressure from past euphoric overinvestment. Japanese-style deflation was feared and widely discussed. And an answer was found by the Federal Reserve: A housing boom could balance the effects of the industrial recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was the Greenspan Gamble, which intentionally fostered a boom in housing in the 2000s to counter the drag in the aftermath of the 1990s equity bubble. Then-Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan explained to Congress in 2002 that the negative wealth effect from the losses in the stock market was being offset by the positive wealth effect of the rise in housing prices. So it was, at that point. But the desired housing boom grew into another massive bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We now have the Bernanke Gamble to foster high prices for debt and equity securities, thus a positive wealth effect to offset the negative wealth effect of the huge losses in real estate and real-estate debt. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's gamble is being wagered on a long period of zero short-term interest rates and by the remarkable expansion of the Fed's own balance sheet, including the purchase of about $1 trillion in mortgage debt -- making the Fed, in a sense, the largest savings and loan in the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will it work? Perhaps. But large unrealized losses still need to be realized and swallowed. We will continue to move sluggishly through an extended period of negotiating how these losses will be distributed. Who will take the hit? Delinquent borrowers, banks, investors (domestic and foreign), the government and government-sponsored entities, and the strapped deposit insurance fund are all involved in these contentious negotiations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The negotiations also involve the role of <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, which although hopelessly insolvent and having their losses paid for by taxpayers, are nonetheless funding the majority of new mortgage loans with government-backed debt. Their supporters want to continue having them fund mortgages as big as $729,750 to help prop up high-end housing prices. Opponents like me point out that this prevents the necessary return of private capital to mortgage finance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the debt hangover works its way through the system, the outlook is for housing to continue along an extended rocky and bumpy bottom, generally moving sideways in nominal terms. Since we will have an overall inflationary regime, real house prices will be falling. After working through the concluding lean years, housing prices can reasonably be expected to regain their long-term trend of increasing a little over 3% per year in nominal terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This would take them back to their highs in 10 years or so. If this happens, it will be far better than the performance of Nasdaq stocks, which a decade later have never even remotely approached their bubble high.</p>

</div><div class="author">By A.D. Pruitt   </div><div>797 words</div><div>9 May 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seven years ago, real-estate developer Greg Smith purchased a failed nursing home in Danbury, Conn., with an eye toward converting it into residential condominiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a friend suggested instead a senior housing strategy known as assisted living Mr. Smith initially wasn't enthused. "I didn't even know what assisted living was," Mr. Smith says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now he knows. His company Maplewood Communities LLC has developed and is operating three assisted-living communities including the one in Danbury and has three others under development. Moreover, Maplewood also just cut a deal with <span class="companylink">Aviv REIT Inc</span>., one of the country's largest landlords of skilled nursing facilities, under which Aviv will provide capital for future growth, initially $60 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're talking about getting 15 to 25 communities under our belt," Mr. Smith says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Assisted-living housing is growing into a bigger business in the New York region. While development is slow of most commercial property types—like office buildings and retail centers—a number of developers are moving ahead with plans to provide facilities that occupy a middle ground between standard apartment buildings and nursing homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Assisted-living tenants typically are elderly people who are generally healthy and can take care of themselves, but the facilities provide services like nurses, aides, dining and memory care. Average rents at Maplewood are $4,700 to $4,900 per month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New York metro area has the second lowest number of available assisted-living units in the country with 2.6 units for every 100 households with seniors aged 75 years and older, according to the National Investment Center for the Seniors Housing &amp; Care Industry. The number of units has grown only 3% in the last five years in the region compared to 7.4% nationally, according to the center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the region's population is aging. People 75 years and older constitute nearly 20% of all households in the metro area, compared to 14.7% in the U.S. overall, according to the National Investment Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We see that demand [is growing] as baby boomers start to climb" in age, says Mr. Smith. "The amount of [new] supply over the last 10 years has been virtually nonexistent."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strategy so far has paid off for Maplewood. For example, it spent $11.5 million to buy the Danbury property and convert into an assisted-living facility equipped with a manmade waterfall in the dinning area. Today, it's roughly 90% occupied, has an annual income of $1.5 million. Mr. Smith estimates its worth at $18 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Altogether, Maplewood has invested about $35 million for its three existing properties. For the properties under development, it has invested about $45 million with a total of 225 units. Mr. Smith estimates that "conservatively" they're worth $55 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other regional operators also are expanding. Benchmark Senior Living, which is Connecticut's largest owner of assisted living with 15 facilities, is expanding into northern New Jersey and suburban New York as well as New England, according to Thomas Grape, Benchmark's chief executive. He declined to elaborate citing competitive concerns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The regional activity reflects a national trend. The biggest real-estate mergers so far this year involved national health- care landlords seeking to expand their senior housing exposure including Ventas's $5.8 billion acquisition of Nationwide Health Properties in February several months after it acquired <span class="companylink">Atria Senior Living</span>, one the biggest regional operators in the New York region. In addition, Health Care REIT recently enters a partnership with Benchmark Senior Living involving 34 assisted living facilities in New England.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeff Theiler, an analyst at Green Street Advisors, says there are nearly 2 million assisted living units in the U.S. and on average, the number has increased 5% every year for the past 25 years. "Because of that resiliency, there has been a big …interest in the property type among the health care REITs," Mr. Theiler says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, assisted living isn't without its pitfalls. Although rents have risen in recent years, the growth hasn't been robust. During the recession, many seniors or their children couldn't sell their homes or didn't have viable employment to pay for assisted-living accommodations, which are relatively expensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Smith&nbsp;started in commercial real estate by developing and acquiring office and hotel buildings more than 10 years ago. But, after he &nbsp;purchased his first assisted living facility in Danbury he decided to focus on this sector. He even recruited family members to live in the Danbury facility, including his great aunt and grandmother who died last year. "They fell in love with it. My grandmother was the matriarch of the community," Mr. Smith said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new wave of residential development is coming to the brownstone neighborhoods of Bedford-Stuyvesant and Clinton Hill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like projects in many sections of Brooklyn, numerous condo developments planned for Bedford-Stuyvesant and Clinton Hill got caught up in the financial crisis and were never finished. But while many of those plans remain in limbo, some smaller developments are on the horizon for the two neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's sort of like back to basics," said Ofer Cohen, president of TerraCRG, a real-estate service firm. "We don't want to go crazy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the active development plans for large buildings in the area are either rental buildings or are affordable-housing apartments that are eligible for city or state subsidies. Lenders remain skittish about funding large condo projects in Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The expiration of a popular city tax break for new construction has also made larger condo developments difficult to get built, driving some developers to smaller projects. "The tax burden is too great," said John Horowitz of Marcus &amp; Millichap Real Estate Investment Services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Townhomes, however, are less costly and easier to finance. "The primary appetite for land we are seeing is for townhome development," said Michael Amirkhanian, director of sales at Massey Knakal Realty Services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A contract has recently been signed for an 8,000-square-foot lot at 37-41 Lexington Ave. in Brooklyn, where the buyer intends to build four, three-family townhomes, said Mr. Cohen of TerraCRG, who marketed the property. The site previously was approved for a 24-unit condominium building, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another buyer has also signed a contract for an 11,000-square-foot plot of undeveloped land at 258-262 Greene Ave., Mr. Cohen said. The buyer intends to build five townhomes there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some townhomes are close to coming to market. At 101-107 Stockton St., construction is nearly complete on five homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While developers prepare for new projects, the area's housing market is still trying to bounce back from the financial downturn. The number of homes sold in 2010 fell to 72 in Bedford-Stuyvesant and to 112 in Clinton Hill from 291 and 309, respectively, in 2006, according to real-estate website Property Shark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are also more than a dozen stalled construction sites in the area, according to the city's Department of Buildings. That doesn't include stalled projects that never filed for building permits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the biggest unfinished sites in the area is 333 Greene Ave., a planned 12-story tower with more than 50 units. No work has been done there since 2009, according to the Department of Buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of the building's construction has angered several neighbors. "We have to learn to live with it, but I think it should be occupied. It shouldn't just sit there," said Daphne Tisdale, 49 years old, who lives in the neighborhood. Officials with project's developer, WT Construction Inc., couldn't be reached to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some larger developments did manage to weather the downturn and make it to market. At 315 Gates Ave., about half of its 72 condo units have sold since hitting the market in September 2010. "It was a game changer for this area," said David Behin, partner at Developers Group, which is marketing the site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More affordable housing is also slated for the neighborhood. At 482 Franklin Ave., there are plans to build a 78-unit, middle-income apartment building using financing from the city's Housing Development Corp., according to the developer, Yosi Cohen of Realty Within Reach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, nonprofit affordable-housing developer Dunn Development Corp. closed a deal on a lot in Clinton Hill where it has plans for a 59-unit rental building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Clinton Hill, when prices were high, was out of our reach," said Martin Dunn, president of the group. During the boom years, that land would have been a condo site, but can now work as an affordable housing development, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While construction financing for large, market-rate condo projects is still tricky to obtain from worrisome lenders, financing for rental buildings has improved, said David Kramer of developer Hudson Cos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hudson Cos. is in the process of searching for lenders to finance a new 114-unit, 17-story rental apartment building at 135 Emerson Place. The company originally planned to build condos there, but couldn't get financing after the financial crisis hit, Mr. Kramer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've been waiting impatiently since June 2008," Mr. Kramer said. "We feel the markets have rebounded."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cleveland</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'Arts and culture is losing its market share of philanthropy," according to the latest National Arts Index, published by Americans for the Arts. But several Cleveland performing-arts and public-media organizations are in better shape than their counterparts around the country because they are part of PlayhouseSquare, a unique business model in downtown Cleveland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After New York's Lincoln Center, PlayhouseSquare is the second-largest performing arts center in the country by audience capacity. Home to 10 performance spaces with a total of more than 9,000 seats, it attracts more than a million visitors to its approximately 1,000 performing-arts events annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In the late '60s, five wonderful theaters that were built in the '20s as vaudeville houses were closing, one by one," Art Falco, PlayhouseSquare's president and CEO, said in a recent interview. "Ray Shepardson, who worked for the Cleveland public-school system, stumbled into the lobby of one, the State Theater, looking for a place to hold a meeting. He knew nothing about theaters or urban renewal, but thought it would be a crime to tear that theater down." His early efforts to save these theaters led to the creation of the nonprofit Playhouse Square Foundation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What makes PlayhouseSquare unique is that it not only renovated and manages the performance spaces—including the five historic theaters (the Ohio, the Palace, the State, the Allen and the Hanna) that otherwise would have been bulldozed for parking lots—but it also created a local development corporation that owns more than 1.6 million square feet of office and retail space inhabited by more than 3,000 workers in five buildings; developed the 205-room Wyndham Cleveland Hotel; and manages an additional million square feet of real estate throughout the Cleveland metropolitan area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its budget of more than $60 million puts it ahead of the better-endowed Cleveland Orchestra and Cleveland Museum of Art. Two-thirds of PlayhouseSquare's annual budget supports the performing arts. One-third is reinvested in its real-estate ventures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The real-estate business is a working endowment for the theaters," said Gina Vernaci, vice president of theatricals for PlayhouseSquare. "The stages feed the neighborhood's excitement and vice-versa," she added. "People who work down here now think about PlayhouseSquare as a campus."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PlayhouseSquare got into commercial real estate when the office buildings containing the Allen and the Hanna theaters came on the market. "We were afraid of what another developer might do, so we bought them," Mr. Falco recalled. "We started a property-management business and hired Tim Luli, a top property manager," recounted Mr. Falco. PlayhouseSquare Real Estate Services started out operating only PlayhouseSquare's properties. Now it also manages more than a million square feet of other owners' properties throughout the Cleveland area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the project grew, the trustees and staff became concerned that downtown Cleveland had little in the way of hotel accommodations. So in partnership with <span class="companylink">Wyndham Hotel Corp</span>. they developed a hotel that opened in 1995 and generates profits for PlayhouseSquare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's no longer enough for performing arts centers to focus on what's on stage," said Lawrence P. Goldman, the New Jersey Performing Arts Center's founder, president and CEO. "This model is not only right but smart because it secures the urban environment around the arts center, which is good for the city and generates revenue. Lincoln Center revived a marginal piece of Manhattan's Upper West Side. But until recently all the benefit of the increased value went to the landowners, not the performing arts." Following the Cleveland model, the 12 acres in downtown Newark, N.J., occupied by the New Jersey Performing Arts Center include eight "developable parcels," Mr. Goldman said. Beginning in July, he will switch roles to head up a new subsidiary called Theater Square Development to focus exclusively on the real-estate business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of PlayhouseSquare's 21st-century extensions has been into broadcast media. "In 2003, we asked the owner of an old, almost entirely vacant department-store building next door to donate his property," Mr. Falco said. "He agreed, if the insurance company would also donate the mortgage on the building, which it did." Ninety thousand square feet of that building now houses Cleveland's WVIZ public TV and WCPN public radio outlets, as well as dance studios and art galleries. "We raised $29 million to redo the building, making it state-of-the-art technologically. We rent the remaining 150,000 square feet to tenants in design, high-tech, education and media—and it's more than 92% rented."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The enterprise keeps growing. Two years ago, PlayhouseSquare acquired the adjacent corner property, which now houses the Cleveland Urban Design Collaborative, which is supported by the College of Architecture and Environmental Design at Kent State University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ironically, the area's oldest and most highly regarded theater company, the Cleveland Play House, is moving its operations to PlayhouseSquare because real estate was a drain on its artistic resources. Until now, the 95-year-old theater was housed in a cultural no-man's land adjacent to the expanding Cleveland Clinic hospital complex in facilities constructed in the 1920s and added to in 1983 with a design by architect Philip Johnson. But as the Play House's current artistic director, Michael Bloom, said, "the move will allow us to focus on our mission, which is top-tier theater and education, and let PlayhouseSquare handle the real estate." Until now, some of his staff spent more time overseeing rental of their spaces than focusing on their theater projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With its move, the Play House's annual operating costs will be reduced by about a half-million dollars. PlayhouseSquare is reconfiguring the Allen Theater and building two smaller adjacent theaters for the Play House. The two organizations are jointly raising $32 million for the renovation and new construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next on the agenda is housing, according to Allen Wiant, who recently joined PlayhouseSquare from high-level positions with top commercial real-estate outfits Trammell Crow and C.B. Richard Ellis. "We want to build 58 stories of housing in the next few years." Virtually nobody lived in downtown Cleveland when this project began in the '70s. Now there are about 12,000 downtown residents and the residential occupancy rate is about 95%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The hallmark of PlayhouseSquare is that they realized a successful theater district could only work if there was a successful neighborhood," Joe Roman, the president &amp; CEO of the Greater Cleveland Partnership, said in a recent interview. "The business community expected a business rigor to what they were doing, and they got it. It's market-based and market-oriented. The theaters are the core, but now there's so much more. The project exceeded everyone's expectations."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sara Murray and James R. Hagerty   </div><div>582 words</div><div>3 May 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>11</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturing activity grew at a robust pace throughout much of the world last month, though high commodity prices, Japanese supply disruptions and monetary tightening in China began to take a toll.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Factory activity in the U.S. grew for the 21st consecutive month in April, though at a slower pace than in previous months. German and French manufacturers drove an acceleration in Europe even as Italy, Spain and Greece lagged behind. Meanwhile, activity in China stayed flat, helping ease concerns about overheating there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowdown in U.S. activity came as manufacturers reported strong demand from abroad but also noted the effect of rising raw-material costs and scattered supply disruptions related to Japan's March 11 earthquake. The Institute for Supply Management's index of manufacturing activity slipped to 60.4 in April from 61.2 the prior month as deliveries from suppliers slowed and order backlogs jumped. Levels above 50 indicate expansion. The prices portion of the index, at 85.5, stood at its highest level since July 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of this growth in manufacturing that's taking place is driven by the export demand and the weaker dollar and that looks to continue," said Norbert Ore, chair of the ISM's survey committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction-equipment maker <span class="companylink">Caterpillar Inc</span>., which reported surging first-quarter earnings last week, said it was having trouble keeping up with export-driven demand for some products, such as excavators and underground mining trucks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An index of overall factory activity in Japan dropped to a two-year low of 45.7 in April from 46.4 a month earlier, Markit Economics and the Japan Materials Management Association reported last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Caterpillar said it is benefiting from heavy spending on infrastructure in Latin America and Asia. About 90% of the large mining trucks Caterpillar makes in Decatur, Ill., are exported, many to Asia, Latin America or Africa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Crown Equipment Corp</span>., a $1.8 billion family-owned maker of forklifts with manufacturing plants in the U.S., Germany, Australia, China and Mexico, says orders are "very elevated" across the world and attributed the strong growth in part to pent-up demand as companies catch up with equipment updates they let slide during the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're getting back in the business of freshening their fleets," said Jim Dicke III, president of the New Bremen, Ohio, company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside the U.S., a purchasing managers' index in the euro zone ticked up to 58.0 from 57.5 in March, Markit Economics said Monday. The details underscored a widening divergence among core European economies such as Germany and France and heavily indebted countries such as Greece, Italy and Spain. Spanish and Greek manufacturers both reported job losses, while activity in Greece declined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In China, meanwhile, the government's efforts to cool the economy with various measures such as higher interest rates and reserve requirements appeared to be having the desired effect. Growth among China's factories was flat at 51.8 in April, according to <span class="companylink">HSBC Holdings PLC</span> -- a result that may help allay worries that inflationary pressures will require Chinese policy makers to engage in further tightening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report Monday, the U.S. Commerce Department reported that construction spending climbed 1.4% in March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $768.9 billion.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Melanie Lefkowitz   </div><div>1162 words</div><div>30 April 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A20</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fort Lee, on the New Jersey side of the George Washington Bridge, emerged as the center of the nation's early film industry, which used the area's dramatic cliffs along the Hudson River as a favorite filming site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A century later, those picturesque bluffs and Hudson views remain a draw for commuters seeking affordable real estate with easy access across the bridge or via ferry to jobs in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I run ads that say, why live in Manhattan when you can look at it for a 10th of the price?" says Michele Kolsky Assatly, a broker in Coldwell Banker's Fort Lee office. "We are the bedroom of Manhattan."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local real estate includes both condos and co-ops with river views -- appealing to young professionals and empty-nesters -- and million-dollar houses near the waterfront. The median sales price for houses, co-ops and condos in Fort Lee in the fourth quarter was $477,500, compared with a median sales price of $490,000 in the same period in 2009, according to StreetEasy.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The borough's population of 36,000 is remarkably diverse. Some 57% of the residents in the Bergen County community speak a language other than English at home, according to 2005-09 Census estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fort Lee's sizable Asian community, spurred by a rapid increase in the Korean population, has brought Asian restaurants and shops to the area. "We have everybody living here, every nationality," Ms. Kolsky Assatly says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the area's buildings have converted in recent years from rentals to condominiums, such as the Palisades, a luxury complex with a 41-story tower as well as townhouses. According to the New Jersey Multiple Listing Service, units for resale in the Palisades include a three-bedroom, three-bathroom unit with an asking price of $1.05 million and a one-bedroom condo listed for $209,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Waterfront property is at a premium in Fort Lee, where most available land has already been developed. Recently, however, the borough of Fort Lee reached an agreement with two developers to build on a long-vacant 16-acre site near the entrance to the George Washington Bridge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the site's two sections, to be known as Hudson Lights, will include 165,000 square feet of retail, as many as 475 residential units and at least three restaurants. The other half will have two high-rise apartment buildings, a park and a movie theater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There isn't anything like this -- this is going to supersede any of the other developments in the area," says Karen DeMarco, of Larry Kahn Real Estate. "What they're doing here is going to be like a little metropolis; it's going to be a little city within a city."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parks: The borough includes 11 local parks, encompassing more than 36 acres of open space. Palisades Interstate Park, which in New Jersey is a 12-mile-long, half-mile-wide expanse along the cliffs beside the Hudson River with 30 miles of hiking trails, passes through Fort Lee. The cliff-top 33-acre Fort Lee Historic Park, on a Revolutionary War fort site named for Gen. Charles Lee from whom the borough also takes its name, offers educational programs as well as bridge and river views.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Schools: The Fort Lee Board of Education includes four elementary schools, a middle school and a high school, with a total enrollment of more than 3,500 students.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 2009-10 school year, 82% of high-school students were proficient or advanced in math, and 93% in language arts, according to state data. All of the high school's students graduated, and 97% continued on to higher education. In the district's elementary schools, 73.4% were proficient in language-arts literacy, and 89.1% in math, state data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local private schools include Christ the Teacher, a Catholic school with about 300 students in grades pre-K through eight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shopping: The Shops at Riverside Mall in Hackensack, with stores including Bloomingdales, <span class="companylink">Barnes &amp; Noble</span> and Pottery Barn, is about 10 minutes away. Big-box stores such as Target and <span class="companylink">Bed Bath &amp; Beyond</span> are in nearby Edgewater, as is the Mitsuwa Marketplace, a massive Japanese grocery store with both fresh and prepared foods, including sushi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dining: Ethnic restaurants line Main Street in downtown Fort Lee. The area has become a destination for its many Korean restaurants, such as So Kong Dong and Madangsui. Hiram's Roadstand, a hot-dog and hamburger joint with outdoor seating, has been a local fixture for decades. The popular Italian restaurant Grissini is in nearby Englewood Cliffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Entertainment: Most residents travel to Manhattan or Hoboken for night-life options. The Bergen Performing Arts Center, a not-for-profit cultural and music venue, is nearby in Englewood. The Fort Lee Film Commission sponsors screenings and outdoor movies.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Robbie Whelan and Dawn Wotapka   </div><div>626 words</div><div>29 April 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three of the nation's largest new-home builders have reported quarterly financial results that were even weaker than the year before, further proof that the housing market has entered a double-dip downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">PulteGroup Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Meritage Homes Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Ryland Group Inc</span>. all had bigger losses and lower revenue as closings showed continued weakness and prices remained depressed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The grim results are expected to continue Friday, when the nation's biggest builder, <span class="companylink">DR Horton</span>, will report earnings for its fiscal second quarter. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the company, on average, to report a loss of five cents a share on revenue of $761 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales typically tick up in the spring selling season as buyers emerge from a winter lull and rush to close on purchases before the new school year starts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But potential buyers continue to bypass new homes, in part because they can pay less for existing homes and because they fear that the values of new homes will erode.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, a growing number of buyers are snatching up foreclosures or other distressed homes, which are often priced at hefty discounts. And other potential new-home buyers can't qualify for a mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen East, a building analyst with Ticonderoga Securities, said that the spring selling season has so far been even worse than most people expected. "Even some of the more bearish people didn't expect these trends, and it absolutely sets the tone for the rest of the year," Mr. East said. "There's no sense of urgency for the consumer to come out and buy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the builders concede that conditions have deteriorated. "The market has gotten significantly weaker than it was a year ago, and that has driven prices and profitability down for everybody," said Steven Hilton, Meritage's chief executive, in a conference call with analysts and investors on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We thought the spring selling season was going to be stronger than it was," he added. "We still feel confident that we're going to make money this year. But I can't be so bold as to say -- after losing $6-plus million in the quarter -- that we're going to make more money than we did last year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late Wednesday, <span class="companylink">Ryland Group</span>, which is based in Calabasas, Calif., reported a loss of $19.5 million, or 44 cents a share. A year earlier, the new-home builder posted a loss of $14.3 million, or 33 cents a share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, Pulte, based in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., said it had a loss of $40 million, or 10 cents a share, in the first quarter, compared with a loss of $12 million, or three cents, a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meritage, based in Scottsdale, Ariz., said its loss was $6.7 million, or 21 cents a share, in the first quarter, compared with a prior-year profit of $2.7 million, or eight cents a share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a brighter note, some builders say that traffic at new-home communities is picking up and could result in stronger sales in the summer. Pulte said that its new orders during the first quarter beat its internal forecasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some builders are seeing margins improve, but that's not necessarily because home prices are recovering. Instead, more builders are offering fewer freebies to potential buyers and selling homes built on land that was left over from the boom and could be snapped up cheaply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But margins could weaken as finished lots, or those ready for construction, run out, forcing builders to spend millions of dollars on land development.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Silicon Valley Estate of 12 Acres</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hits the Market for $59.5 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 12-acre Silicon Valley property that belonged to a great-grandniece of <span class="companylink">Levi Strauss</span> is asking $59.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sellers of the Atherton, Calif., property, called Pine Brook, are the children of San Francisco philanthropist Madeleine Haas Russell, who died in 1999. The family has owned it for a century and used it as a summer retreat. There's a main, English Tudor-style house of more than 11,000 square feet. There's also a 6,500-square-foot guest house, a swimming pool, pool house, tennis court and gardens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The family members say in a statement that they always intended to eventually sell the land. Listing agent Mary Gullixson of Alain Pinel Realtors says the estate is an unusually large offering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blixseth Home in Montana</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heads to Bankruptcy Auction</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 160-acre property that belonged to Edra and Tim Blixseth, the founders of Yellowstone Club in Big Sky, Mont., is being sold in a bankruptcy auction with an effective minimum reserve of $11.1 million. The property is located in the club, which counts Bill Gates and cyclist Greg LeMond among its members.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The timbered property has two three-bedroom homes built in 2007 as guest homes for a main house that was never built. Ms. Blixseth acquired the property, along with the Yellowstone Club and a 249-acre estate near Palm Springs, Calif., in a divorce settlement in 2008; she later filed for bankruptcy. Boston-based private-equity firm CrossHarbor Capital Partners acquired the Yellowstone Club in 2009 and Larry Ellison bought the estate near Palm Springs this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deadline to submit bids in the court-ordered sale is May 16, with the auction scheduled for May 20 in Missoula, Mont., if qualified bids are received. In their absence, the property is expected to go to CrossHarbor, the first lienholder on the property; it has submitted a bid of $10.9 million. Buyers would need to obtain membership to access the club's facilities. Bill McDavid of Hall &amp; Hall represents the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Glenn Beck Sells in Connecticut</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Talk-show host Glenn Beck and his wife, Tania, have sold their New Canaan, Conn., home for $3.6 million, 27% less than its $4.9 million asking price in late 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Beck, who earlier this month announced plans to leave his popular and controversial Fox News show, bought the home with his wife in 2005 for $4.3 million. The six-bedroom colonial farmhouse-style home is 11,320 square feet and sits on 2.8 flat acres overlooking a reservoir. The house was built in 2004 and has a covered porch and a pool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Beck recently announced during a live stage show that he had sold the home and planned to move out of the New York City area. Fox News, like The Wall Street Journal, is owned by <span class="companylink">News Corp</span>. Lynne Leonard of Lynne Leonard Realty represented the Becks.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Joseph De Avila   </div><div>417 words</div><div>28 April 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A21</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction spending in New York City dropped 12% last year, falling to its lowest level since 2005, according to a new report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders cut back on residential housing and office buildings even as the city's economy slowly began adding jobs again. Part of the drop last year was due to big projects like the new Yankee Stadium and Citi Field wrapping up in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of construction workers also fell by 8,900 to 111,800 in 2010. It's the fewest construction workers employed in the city since 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there were some bright spots for the industry. Spending held up on projects for government, universities and the health-care industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is good news -- and a lot of question marks," said Richard T. Anderson, president of trade association New York Building Congress, which prepared the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, builders spent $23.7 billion last year, down from $27.1 billion in 2009. Spending has dropped 23% since peaking at $31.06 billion in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending on residential construction fell by 14% to $2.2 billion last year from $2.6 billion in 2009. "It has effectively come to a screeching halt," Mr. Anderson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the real-estate boom, the construction industry churned out 34,000 homes or apartments a year. Last year it produced only about 5,400.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though the jobless rate improved last year, the city ended 2010 with nearly 9% unemployment, and demand for office space remains weak. Spending on nonresidential construction fell by 10% to $8 billion from $8.8 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would have been even worse if not for a few large projects, including the World Trade Center and the new basketball arena at the Atlantic Yards in Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government projects from the city and the state continued to be a reliable source of work for the construction industry. "The big question is what happens after this year," Mr. Anderson said. State agencies like the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the Department of Transportation still don't have capital budgets in place for 2012, worrying many in the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building congress forecasts that construction spending in the city for 2011 will be flat at about $24 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"So far in 2011, there seems to be an increased level of activity and optimism," said Joseph Mizzi, president of Sciame Construction Co., which builds projects for local universities and cultural institutions.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HONG KONG -- Higher borrowing costs may finally lead to falling prices in the world's least-affordable housing market, one that so far has resisted government efforts to cool it down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices of Hong Kong properties jumped 24% last year on top of a 30% surge in 2009, according to local property indexes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are signs that the pace of transactions in the market for existing housing has started to slow. Hong Kong leaders now worry that a small trickle of cash out of the market for luxury housing, driven by wealthy mainland Chinese, could accelerate and send prices tumbling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates are starting to rise, albeit from levels of less than 1% a year for some adjustable-rate loans. Earlier this month, <span class="companylink">HSBC Holdings PLC</span> and some other banks announced higher rates on certain mortgage loans for new customers; <span class="companylink">HSBC</span> now charges as much as 1.5 percentage point above the Hong Kong interbank offered rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span> forecasts that a steady rise in borrowing costs, to above 4% next year, in part as the U.S. Federal Reserve starts increasing its own interest rates, could eventually lead to a drop in sales. Because the value of the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar, local interest rates are effectively set by the U.S., even though banks can adjust their mortgage rates independently of central-bank moves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial Secretary John Tsang earlier this month warned investors not to count on cheap credit. "The current abundant liquidity and low interest rates will not last forever," he said. "Neither will rising property prices."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, government efforts to cool the market, including moves in November to impose new taxes aimed at discouraging speculative transactions and restrict credit for high-end purchases, haven't worked. Analysts say that the market remained strong because interest rates remained low and buyers had easy access to cheap loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the November measures, average housing prices have risen an additional 15%, according to an index compiled by Centaline, a property agency. Sales volume increased 9% in March from February, according to the latest Land Registry report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A survey on global housing affordability, published by Demographia International in January, ranked Hong Kong last among 325 urban markets. The territory's median house price was 11.4 times Hong Kong's gross annual median household income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By comparison, New York ranked 68th in affordability, with prices at 6.1 times median income. Atlanta was ranked most affordable; the median home price was 2.3 times income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hong Kong's housing prices now are above the peak reached in 1997, just before a financial crisis hammered most of the region, Mr. Tsang noted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discontent over unaffordable housing -- and the belief that government policy favors powerful property developers over ordinary people -- has become a political flashpoint. Recently, activists from the Civic Party's youth branch camped outside the offices of Li Ka-shing, Hong Kong's richest businessman, to protest what they call the "property-developer hegemony."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, some analysts are forecasting that the market is close to a tipping point. Analysts at <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span> predict prices will rise another 15% this year as the supply of new apartments remains low, even as the number of transactions starts to fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next year, they added in a recent report, prices could fall 15% to 20% from 2011 levels. In 2013, the report said, prices could fall another 10% from the 2012 levels. The <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> analysts also predict mortgage rates will rise to 2.5% at the end of this year and above 4% next year, an increase that would make housing less affordable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But others doubt that rising mortgage rates will stem demand, because of mainland Chinese buyers who don't rely much on loans to buy property. Newly affluent Chinese account for some 30% of luxury real-estate purchases in Hong Kong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That could change if the Beijing government take additional measures to cool down China's overheating economy, such as raising interest rates further or boosting reserve requirements for banks. This month, China raised the share of deposits banks must hold as reserves at the nation's central bank to 20.5%, the 10th increase since the start of last year, after boosting interest rates yet again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, a drop in home prices is unlikely to bring the sort of damage to banks that U.S. lenders suffered after the U.S. housing bubble burst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts say banks are protected from the impact of a downturn by the conservative loan-to-value ratios in use in Hong Kong, as well as the use of recourse lending, in which banks can go after borrowers who default on loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a sign of continued optimism about the housing market, developers behind two luxury residential projects haven't budged on prices, despite sluggish sales. The developers say that their current asking prices reflect the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Queen's Cube, a 96-unit luxury residential building jointly developed by <span class="companylink">Nan Fung Development Ltd</span>. and an arm of the Hong Kong government, has sold only eight apartments since the project was launched in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Units at Queen's Cube have sold for between roughly HK$14,000 a square foot and HK$18,500 a square foot (about US$1,800 to US$2,380), well above the average price of HK$12,292 a square foot in the Wanchai district, according to data from Midland Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Donald Choi, managing director of Nan Fung, said the firm hasn't lowered prices at Queen's Cube.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just five of 66 apartments have sold at <span class="companylink">Henderson Land Development Co</span>.'s 39 Conduit Road development in the Midlevels district; 20 of the first 24 sales fell through in June. One of the canceled sales was for a 6,158-square-foot duplex that went for HK$71,280 per square foot, which would have made it the world's most expensive apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 39 Conduit Road project has sold only one unit since the cancellations: a semi-duplex that fetched HK$60,000 per square foot -- a record price for a luxury apartment in Hong Kong, according to Henderson Land. Homes in the Midlevels district average about HK$15,000 per square foot, says Midland Realty broker Phoebe Wong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These developers are cash-rich, so they're waiting the market out," said Benedict Ma, associate director of research at <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joseph Chetrit, a New York developer and one of the owners of America's tallest building, is moving ahead with a long-delayed residential project overlooking Prospect Park in the latest sign of life in the city's real estate industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Chetrit has begun interior demolition on the former Caledonian Hospital complex at 100 Parkside Ave., which he is planning to convert into a 270-unit condominium and rental development, according to Karl Fischer, the architect on the project. "The rental units may come on the market, I suspect, within a year," he said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Moroccan-born immigrant, Mr. Chetrit is a member of a group of private investors who burst on the global scene in 2004 when they purchased the Sears Tower in Chicago, later renamed the Willis Tower. The members of the loosely knit group—which also includes Jeffrey Feil, Joseph Moinian and Lloyd Goldman—occasionally join forces but often do deals by themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Chetrit is moving ahead with the 100 Parkside project at a time that work is slowly being renewed on some projects stalled by the downturn, even as the real estate outlook remains murky and financing remains difficult to obtain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, a venture of his Chetrit Group and Stellar Management is close to signing a deal with the Manhattan division of Jewish Home Lifecare to do a major land swap on the Upper West Side that would give the venture the home's huge 106th Street campus for housing development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Chetrit is acting even more bullishly with the Brooklyn development because it's in a neighborhood that remains economically depressed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Flatbush area has seen some gentrification in recent years thanks to its proximity to the park and overflow from tonier neighborhoods like Park Slope. But the median household income in the census tract that encompasses the Caledonian Hospital site is $33,671, according to the Census Bureau's 2005-2009 American Community Survey, a 3% increase since 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 100 Parkside development also is unusual because residential projects launched since the downturn have primarily been rentals, as the market for those units has been stronger than the sales market. In the first four months of 2011 only 49 condominium offering plans were submitted to the New York Attorney General's office, compared with 78 in the same period of 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Chetrit, who very rarely speaks to the press, didn't respond to repeated requests for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chetrit Group made its name in New York real estate over the past 20 years with the purchase of properties like Park West Village on the Upper West Side, the International Toy Center on Madison Square Park, and 500 and 512 Seventh Ave. in the Garment District, often in partnership with Mr. Moinian.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chetrit Group bought the former Caledonian Hospital in August 2007 for $15.6 million, according to city records. The sale was part of Brooklyn Hospital Center's effort to come out of bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Joe's one of the smartest guys I've ever met," said James Kuhn, a friend of Mr. Chetrit's who, as president of Newmark Knight Frank, brokered the hospital transaction. "He has an amazing eye for value. Lots of guys buy trophy buildings, but Joe finds good real estate under rocks."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hospital purchase, however, was poorly timed. Soon after it closed, the housing market collapsed and the project was put on hold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The revived development is one of about 25 formerly stalled sites shedding their mothballs in New York City, according to Orest Tomaselli, chief executive of National Condo Advisors, a firm that helps market and liquidate condominiums across the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've seen a lot of developments that have started to come back, after suffering huge blows due to the marketplace and the economy," Mr. Tomaselli said. According to Mr. Tomaselli, condo developers are just learning how to comply with more stringent government regulations that enable home buyers to get government-backed mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, the development business remains difficult. The city is gaining jobs but uncertainty hangs over the national economic and real-estate market. Indeed, Jewish Home was on the verge of signing its land swap deal with Chetrit Group and Stellar last summer, but negotiations have proven to be more protracted than expected. Under the terms of the deal, the venture will get the Jewish Home's campus in exchange for a site on West 100th Street and an undisclosed amount of cash. Jewish Home plans to build a cutting-edge facility that will cost more than $250 million on that site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's been difficult," said Ethan Geto, a spokesman for the Jewish Home in an interview on Saturday. "But we think we have everything pinned down and that within a few months we'll finalize the deal," he said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices are rising rapidly in Australia, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Israel, Singapore, South Africa and Sweden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices are flat -- or falling -- in Britain, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Welcome to the two-speed global economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When most observers talk about a "two-speed economy," they are contrasting slow-growing mature or advanced economies (the U.S., Europe, Japan, etc.) with fast-growing developed or emerging-market economies (China, India, Brazil, etc.). Philip Suttle of the Institute of International Finance, a bankers association, calls it "a two-and-six world." In mature economies, growth and inflation are at around 2%; in emerging markets both are around 6%. Whenever anything nudges them off that course, he says, something else nudges them back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there's another way to divide the world: Some economies had a big banking crisis. Some didn't. And the ones that didn't are the ones where housing prices are shooting up. Slow growth in mature economies is leading them to keep interest rates low and credit conditions easy. Because they (so far) dominate world financial markets, that means global credit is easy, too easy for emerging markets where inflation -- in wages, prices and asset prices -- is the worry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In countries where the financial system was not seriously damaged during the global crisis, housing prices have risen rapidly," says Stanley Fischer, governor of the Bank of Israel. "That's because when interest rates were cut sharply to deal with the crisis, mortgage interest rates also fell rapidly, and people responded by borrowing to buy houses -- thereby driving up the price of houses."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low rates in the U.S. and other economies hit hard by the financial crisis aren't having the same effect. Their banks aren't yet eager or able to lend readily. In the U.S., for instance, the latest 20-city S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home-price index was 3.1% below year-earlier levels and those year-ago levels were 29% below the 2006 peak. The latest Federal Reserve survey found little evidence that banks are undoing tighter mortgage-lending standards imposed during the worst of the bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But elsewhere -- particularly in countries flooded with money fleeing super-low interest rates in the U.S., Europe and Japan -- banks are lending, people are buying and home prices are climbing. This isn't only an emerging-market phenomenon. In Canada, for instance, commercial banks were hardly shaken by the crisis but the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> has been holding its key rate at just 1% to foster economic growth. The consequence: Housing prices in February were up nearly 9% from year-earlier levels, the Canadian Real Estate Association says. The worry in Canada and elsewhere is that what goes up might come down, and history amply illustrates the economic harm done when housing prices plunge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Israel, banks were spared the worst of the crisis; they hadn't invested much in U.S. subprime mortgages. But Israel wasn't immune from shock waves from abroad so its central bank cut rates all the way to 0.5% in 2009. That made mortgages cheap. Over the past year, the house prices are up 16.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Continued rapid price increases could threaten stability, and in that sense could lead to the creation of a bubble," the Bank of Israel says. Raising rates will make mortgages more costly, and Mr. Fischer has been pursuing that, recently pushing the central bank's benchmark rate up to 3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But like many of his counterparts elsewhere, Mr. Fischer knows a side-effect of higher rates is a higher currency. And that hits Israel's vibrant export sector. So he is looking for alternatives more targeted on home prices: The Bank of Israel has imposed rules meant to increase the cost of mortgages. So far, they hit only mortgages larger than 800,000 shekels (about $235,000) with down payments below 40%, but there are no signs that the Bank of Israel will stop at that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this (and perhaps only in this) respect, Israel is not unusual. The average house price in Hong Kong rose more than 20% in 2010 following a 30% increase the year before. In the first two months of this year, prices rose another 7%. "The current abundant liquidity and low interest rates will not last forever. Neither will rising property prices," Financial Secretary John Tsang warned recently. Authorities are pushing lenders to make mortgages harder to get, lifting minimum down payments and imposing taxes of up to 15% on property sales to cool things off. Singapore has done much the same, levying a tax on residential properties held less than three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some big countries had a housing bubble that burst, provoking the biggest financial crisis in half a century. To avoid a depression, they flooded the world with credit. And that credit threatens to create new housing bubbles in other countries. No one ever said globalization was easy. ---</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes rose slightly in March, but prices continued to fall, underscoring the fragility of the housing market's recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales increased 3.7% in March from February, according to data from the National Association of Realtors released Wednesday. That represents a seasonally adjusted pace of 5.1 million—less than the 5.4 million rate in January and 5.2 million in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers disappointed an industry that has been hoping for a rebound in the all-important spring sales season. "The economic recovery has bypassed the housing market," Toronto-based Capital Economics wrote in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Distressed sales accounted for 40% of all sales in March, the highest in two years, according to NAR. All-cash buyers made up 35% of all transactions—the highest since record-keeping began in 2008—in a sign of a persistently tight lending environment keeping many entry-level buyers from inking deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A fundamental upturn in housing requires first-time home buyers," said Steve Blitz, senior economist with ITG Investment Research. "With tighter requirements and no low-down-payment [loans] available, the renting cohort is still renting and not making the necessary impact to believe that the housing market has turned," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until prices stabilize, the housing market faces a long slog toward recovery. The median price in March fell to $159,600, down nearly 6% from a year earlier. Home prices have fallen so low that investors are snapping up homes to fix and resell for a profit or to turn into rentals; investors accounted for 22% of sales activity in March, up from 19% in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realtors say sellers must accept the reality of low pricing and stop waiting for a return of boom-era values. "If sellers are realistic, their homes will move quickly," said Cindy Jones, a broker with C.J. Realty Group in Prince William County, Va., outside Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Jones says that homes priced right and in prime locations are seeing, in some cases, multiple offers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the spring season drags on, desperate sellers will have no choice but to further cut prices, leading some real-estate agents to forecast a sales pickup by summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, there are some signs for hope: Sales volume has risen six out of the last eight months. And applications for residential mortgages rose 5.3% last week, marking the first increase in a month, the Mortgage Bankers Association said Wednesday. The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 4.83% from 4.98% a week earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further, housing's downturn has not hit some segments as hard. SeattleHome.com managing broker Sam DeBord says waterfront sales, for example, remain strong. "Year-to-date sales of waterfront in Seattle and the Eastside are up 15%, compared to the sales volume at this time last year," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, overall, housing remains troubled, and the existing market's woes continue rippling into the new-home sector. Builders are having trouble competing with existing inventory, particularly rock-bottom prices on distressed deals. They, too, will likely cut prices in coming months to salvage the selling season, said Daniel Oppenheim, a home-builder analyst with <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some builders say they are losing business from would-be buyers who can't sell their existing homes. New construction remains dependent on such buyers looking to move into larger, single-family homes or downsize into smaller ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That's the biggest reason why they won't sign on the dotted line," said Bill Bonenberger, founder of Pennsylvania-based W.B. Homes. "It absolutely has to do with their insecurity about having to sell their home and get what they believe is the fair price."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anthony Bartolone of South Elgin, Ill., finds himself in that position. He wants to upgrade to a bigger new home, but his three-bedroom home hasn't sold in the nine months it has been listed. He priced it at $199,999, enough to cover what he owes, but below the $227,000 he paid six years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"New homes are so cheap, they're giving them away," the 32-year-old said. But "there are so many foreclosures and short sales. It's hard to compete."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home building rebounded a bit in March from a winter slump, but construction remains near historically low levels heading into the crucial spring selling season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of homes and apartments last month jumped 7.2% from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 549,000 from 512,000 in February, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures for February were revised upward and building permits, a gauge of future construction, climbed 11.2% from a month earlier to an annual rate of 594,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even with the monthly bounce, overall activity remains depressed: March's level of housing starts was the tenth lowest since records began in January 1959. Compared with the same month a year earlier, overall new-home construction was 13.4% lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing remains a significant soft spot in an otherwise recovering economy. Builders have remained idle due to weak demand and competition from the large stock of empty housing. Buyers, meantime, are having trouble getting credit or are wary of buying when home prices are still falling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, Tuesday, the Federal Reserve proposed a set of minimum standards for home lending as part of an effort to ensure that consumers can afford mortgages they take out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rules were required by the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul passed last year, which tasked lenders with ensuring that all borrowers have the ability to pay back their home loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential investment, which includes new home construction as well as and renovations, has been a crucial part of every economic recovery for the past half-century. But in this recovery it has slowed, not spurred growth. New-home construction last year peaked in April, but then fell sharply when tax incentives for first-time purchases expired. Last year was the worst year on record for new home sales, dating back to 1963.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists as well as many builders expect housing woes to continue through 2011 and beyond. Forecasting firm IHS Global Insight, for instance, is projectings residential investment will subtract 0.1 percentage point from first-quarter GDP growth, which will be released by the Commerce Department next week. As of Tuesday, the firm was forecasting GDP growth at a 1.9% annual rate in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist at MFR Inc., said, "The inability of housing to contribute in a meaningful manner to overall real (gross domestic product) growth is a large reason behind the sub-par nature of this recovery."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charter Homes &amp; Neighborhoods in Lancaster, Pa., sold 21 homes in March and expects to sell about 25 in April. That's good news, but average prices have fallen into the $290,000 range from about $315,000 last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is just another year that's going to require us to keep our nose to the grindstone," said President Rob Bowman. "It isn't the Spring I hoped it was going to be, but it's the one I knew was going to happen. I was really looking forward to a significant bounce off the bottom, but it's going to be a while longer before that happens."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month's housing starts were driven by construction of single-family homes, which made up more than three-quarters of all starts. Single-family construction was up 7.7% to an annual rate of 422,000.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Craig Karmin </div><div>712 words</div><div>18 April 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A20</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A high-profile downtown condominium conversion project by developer Kent Swig that hit the wall during the downturn is coming back to life as a rental apartment building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, the leasing office at 25 Broad St. will open, offering rentals of one-bedroom units starting at $3,133 and two-bedroom apartments beginning at $5,205. Mr. Swig had tried to convert the building into condos but he defaulted on his mortgage loan in 2008 and the following year a New York state court appointed a receiver to figure out what to do with it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conversion plan reflects the often stronger demand for rentals than for condos in the city's slowly recovering housing market. The Financial District, which suffered as badly as any Manhattan neighborhood during the downturn, also is showing renewed life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that doesn't mean leasing the 305 units at 25 Broad will be easy. Competition among landlords downtown has been intensifying lately as thousands of new units hit the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 20-story building just down the street from the New York Stock Exchange has had a number of lives. Completed in 1902 it was at one time considered one of the country's most valuable office properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But by the late 1990s properties that old were becoming obsolete as office buildings. Developer Crescent Heights acquired the property in 1997 and converted it into a rental building, one of the area's first conversion projects of that type.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2005, Mr. Swig paid $200 million for the property, adding to a portfolio of commercial properties he controlled in the Financial District. After he defaulted on a mortgage loan, the estate of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers Holdings</span> began foreclosing on the property and a court-appointed receiver hired developer LCOR Inc. to put the project back on the market. The Lehman estate invested $39.9 million in the building, including the completion of renovations and replacing the cooling and heating systems, according to court documents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The population of the financial district including Battery Park city has doubled over the past decade to nearly 40,000, according to U.S. Census Bureau. Developers of rental properties in the area are aiming to attract 20- and 30-something professionals who have disposable income but may lack the ability to finance a condo purchase or who remain concerned about the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, a new 76-story building designed by Frank Gehry began renting more than 900 units on Spruce Street. William Beaver House has rented 66 units since Los Angeles-based CIM Group late last year took control of the 209 unsold condos. This month apartment owner UDR Inc. completed a $261 million acquisition of a 493-unit multifamily building at 10 Hanover Square.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Metro Loft Management is converting an office building at 116 John Street to 418 rental apartments that are expected to hit the market by next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 25 Broad Street units are being marketed by Rose Associates. LCOR says it is counting on 25 Broad's condo-like finishes to separate it from the pack. Those fixtures include Italian cabinetry and Bosch stoves. The building also touts 35 different floor plans for 305 units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It offers what has become standard amenities for luxury rentals, most of which were planned by the previous developer for the condo, including a fitness center, lounge, and roof deck. A golf simulator will replace a private screening theater, which LCOR thought had become passe in the age of high-definition big screens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But its biggest appeal may be the concessions," says Ariel Cohen, a Prudential Douglas Elliman broker active in the area, The developers are offering one-month free rent and paying broker's fees for anyone signing a one or two-year lease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With other buildings phasing out these sort of incentives, "this should create some buzz for them," Mr. Cohen says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for Swig Equities said, "We are proud of the renovation of 25 Broad Street completed by Swig Equities in June 2008, and are pleased that tenants will be able to enjoy living in this magnificent historic property."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Josh Barbanel   </div><div>677 words</div><div>14 April 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A22</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last six unsold penthouses near the top of the clock tower that has dominated the Brooklyn skyline for a generation are due to be auctioned off next month, a sale that could fetch well over $10 million based on the units' previous asking prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 37-story tower, now known as One Hanson Place went on the market in 2006, with a development team that included former basketball great Earvin "Magic" Johnson. Now, following the ups and downs of the market, all but six of its 179 apartments have been sold, and the developers said they wanted to quickly sell the others and move on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Brooklyn tower was built in 1927 as a headquarters of the Williamsburgh Savings Bank, though for decades many offices in the buildings were rented by Brooklyn dentists. Until a few years ago, it was the tallest building in Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under plans announced Wednesday, the six units, including two with terraces larger than most New York apartments, will be sold on May 15 at an auction to be held in the building's limestone-and-marble banking hall. The hall, which features 63-foot-high vaulted ceilings, is now used as a catering facility and the site of a flea market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Misha Haghani, a principal of the auction company Paramount Realty USA, said at least two of the condos would be sold to the highest bidder without conditions or minimum prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five of the penthouses are full-floor units; the sixth is a duplex, on two full floors, with a terrace that once served as a private observation deck for the head of the bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asking prices for the six apartments once ranged between $3.7 million and nearly $5.8 million, but were significantly reduced during the downturn, when sales slowed down across the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The high-floor condos have crow's-nest views of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, the Statue of Liberty and the Manhattan skyline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current developers bought the bank building in 2005 from <span class="companylink">HSBC Holdings PLC</span>, the London-based bank which had acquired it as the result of a series of bank mergers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building was redeveloped by a joint venture of Dermot Co., a New York developer and the Canyon-Johnson Urban Funds. Mr. Johnson is a partner in Canyon-Johnson. The project includes retail and offices on the lower floors with condominiums above.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building, with its huge, four-sided clocks, towers over Downtown Brooklyn, but it is actually located in nearby Fort Greene, near Atlantic and Flatbush avenues, and a major <span class="companylink">Long Island Rail Road</span> terminal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It went on the market in the fall of 2006, and the first buyers closed on their purchases in 2007. As the real-estate market heated up sales soared, including more than 100 deals that closed in 2008. Sales then all but stopped for about six months, before strengthening again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A four-bedroom apartment with a 2,900-square-foot terrace was originally priced at $5.8 million, but was listed last year at $3.45 million. Now it is due to be offered at auction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maria L. Stamolis, a managing director at Canyon-Johnson, said that the developers had long since paid off their lenders, finished work on the building and were now looking to move their attention to other projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is no reason not to find market-clearing prices and sell these apartments," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Chapman, a broker at Stribling and Associates, who until recently held the listings at One Hanson Place, said that while the building was on the market, Fort Greene had become "more of a known neighborhood," further helping sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building department records list the height of One Hanson Place as 512 feet. The Brooklyner, a 51-story rental building in downtown Brooklyn that opened last year, is listed at 514 feet.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc</span>. real-estate engine was chugging during the boom years, the firm teamed up with developer LCOR Inc. on dozens of projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, as real-estate development begins to stir in a few markets, Lehman's bankruptcy estate is preparing to put its equity stake in about 10 of those projects on the block, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyer of Lehman's stakes also likely would step into the investment bank's old role as LCOR's financial partner in future developments, these people said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The makeup of the package being sold by Lehman isn't yet clear, and neither is the estimated price the package will fetch. Representatives of Lehman and LCOR declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The estate's preliminary plans to put the package on the block now reflect the heightened interest among lenders and investors for new construction in key markets such as New York and Washington, especially in the apartment sector. Last week, for example, apartment landlord Archstone -- another entity part-owned by the Lehman estate -- and Houston developer Hines broke ground on a long-delayed, $700 million mixed-use project in downtown Washington after securing equity financing from the real-estate arm of the Qatari Investment Authority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planned sale also comes as the Lehman estate steps up its effort to sell the bankrupt investment bank's huge portfolio of commercial real estate. "We would expect, over the next six to 12 months, to have a much more aggressive disposition strategy, particularly on the strategic real-estate assets," Bryan Marsal, Lehman's chief executive, said in bankruptcy court on Jan. 13, according to a transcript. "You're going to see some major transactions coming before this court."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LCOR, a developer based in Berwyn, Pa., for years partnered with Lehman on about 30 projects, from Terminal 4 at New York's <span class="companylink">John F. Kennedy International Airport</span> to the $850 million mixed-use project at the White Flint Metrorail station in Washington's Maryland suburbs. After Lehman's collapse in 2008, the investment bank continued to invest in some of LCOR's projects to keep construction going and preserve value for creditors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now, Lehman is looking to sell its interest in a large chunk of those projects to a buyer that also could secure a role as LCOR's partner in future development, people familiar with the matter say. The buyer could be a pension fund, an overseas sovereign-wealth fund or even a very wealthy individual, and could use the partnership with LCOR to get access to a development pipeline that could prove profitable if the economic rebound continues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, in a separate deal, Lehman and LCOR sold their share of the company that runs Terminal 4 to the owner of <span class="companylink">Amsterdam's Schiphol airport</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LCOR has its roots in national developer <span class="companylink">Lincoln Property Co</span>. Eric Eichler, LCOR's chairman, was Lincoln's Northeast regional partner before forming Linpro Co. in 1978. LCOR, formed in 1992, acquired Linpro's assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite Lehman's travails, LCOR has been forging ahead with preparations for new development, buying a site last month in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, N.Y., for an apartment project and planning a mixed-use development at the commuter-rail station in Hoboken, N.J. At the White Flint station in North Bethesda, Md., the company is building a 400,000-square-foot headquarters annex for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Lehman estate, meanwhile, has been slow to wind down the huge real-estate portfolio that the investment bank built up during the property boom, betting that it can maximize value for creditors by holding on to and, in some cases, doubling down on assets. For example, Lehman reinvested $263 million last year in a group of office buildings in Rosslyn, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But expectations are rising that Lehman will find a way to sell more of its real-estate holdings this year, with property values up from their lows and creditors waiting to be paid back. Apartment landlord Archstone, which was taken private in 2007 in a $22 billion buyout largely financed by Lehman, could go public this year. In California and elsewhere, Lehman is looking for joint-venture partners to help develop its $1 billion land portfolio.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Val Kilmer's Ranch Finds a Buyer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actor Val Kilmer is contracted to sell his 6,000-acre New Mexico ranch for an undisclosed price, according to a listing broker. It is also listed as "under contract" on the <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> website. The sale price and the buyer could not be learned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kilmer's lawyer, Ralph H. Scheuer, says that before the property sells, "a lot of contingencies have to be filled" and it is not actually in contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property most recently listed for $18.5 million; it originally came on the market in 2009 for $33 million. About 30 miles east of Santa Fe, the Pecos River Ranch has roughly six miles of a popular trout-fishing river running through it and is home to wildlife like mountain lions, elk and deer. The property includes a four-bedroom, four-bath log-built house as well as several guest and staff houses. There's also an equestrian complex.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kilmer, who has starred in films including "The Doors" and "Batman Forever," has operated the ranch as a bed and breakfast. Darlene Streit, Pam Sawyer and Bob Jacobs of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span> in Santa Fe have the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Phil's Beverly Hills Estate</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Goes Into Contract</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phil McGraw, better known as Dr. Phil, has agreed to sell his Beverly Hills, Calif., estate for an undisclosed price. The asking price on the home was recently reduced to $13.9 million from $16.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gated, Mediterranean-style mansion has eight bedrooms and seven bathrooms, as well as a movie theater, gym and billiard room. The property includes a two-bedroom guest house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, Mr. McGraw, who hosts a syndicated advice talk show, bought another Mediterranean-style 14,000-square-foot home in Beverly Hills for $29.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Billy Dolan of Hilton &amp; Hyland has the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Private Bahamian Island</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lists for $22 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A private island in the Bahamas has listed for $22 million. The sellers are Steve and Patrick Harrington, Miami-based brothers who are former investment bankers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The island, which includes a 4,000-square-foot-house, has two miles of coastline and 145 acres of land. It's about five minutes by boat from the island of Great Exuma, which has an international airport and luxury resorts. Celebrities like David Copperfield and Tim McGraw and Faith Hill own islands nearby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Harrington brothers purchased the island in 2006. Steve Harrington says they're selling because they're developing several other islands and need to raise capital. "We've taken an investment-banking approach to buying up trophy properties in the Bahamas," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The island is listed with Phillip Yaffa of Engel &amp; Volkers, a Miami-based real-estate company.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kris Hudson   </div><div>854 words</div><div>6 April 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Grubb &amp; Ellis Co</span>., one of the oldest commercial-real-estate brokerages in the U.S., was facing a bleak future in 1996 when Detroit real-estate investor C. Michael Kojaian rode to the rescue, helping to recapitalize it by buying a 5% stake. The company is on "a solid foundation," he said at the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now it is Mr. Kojaian, the firm's chairman and largest shareholder, who is looking for help. After sustaining a $78.4 million loss in 2010 and straining under its debt, Grubb said last month that it has hired JMP Securities to help it explore "strategic options," including a sale or merger. Mr. Kojaian owns 32.8% of Grubb's common stock if he converts all of his preferred shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One possible buyer is private-equity investor <span class="companylink">Colony Capital LLC</span>. Grubb disclosed last week that Colony provided it an $18 million short-term loan at an 11% interest rate. In addition, Colony received a 60-day exclusive period to evaluate a potential larger investment with Grubb. If such a deal is struck, Grubb has 25 days to find a better offer. Colony declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moves come at a time when Grubb, of Santa Ana, Calif., has fallen behind its competitors. While the stocks of firms like <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis Group Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle Inc</span>. are trading near 52-week highs, Grubb's shares have been struggling below $2 for much of the past year and below $1 for the past two weeks. In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading Tuesday, Grubb's shares rose 1.4%, to 72 cents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Grubb has struggled partly because its peers are larger and more profitable than it is. In comparison to Grubb's 2010 net loss of $78.4 million, CBRE posted $201.3 million of net income last year and Jones Lang posted $154 million. Brandon Dobell, an analyst who tracks brokerages for <span class="companylink">William Blair &amp; Co</span>., summed up Grubb's struggles as "a convergence of ill-timed decisions, a very difficult commercial real-estate environment and the challenges of competing with some very large and specialized players."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A chief concern is Grubb's debt, which totals $30 million of convertible bonds, $16 million in corporate debt, a $10 million mortgage and $90 million of preferred stock. The brokerage's effort to get holders of the convertible bonds to agree to changes in default guidelines has met resistance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For his part, Mr. Kojaian remains bullish about Grubb. He declined to comment on whether he might again recapitalize the company or take it private. "We feel the company is very well-positioned," he said in an interview Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industry analysts and executives tie Grubb's problems partly to the commercial-real-estate market, which during the downturn has seen a drop in leasing and sales activity. While volume has picked up in the past six months, it still is far from where it was during the boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, Grubb has suffered by not being as successful as its competitors as rolling out new services. Both <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> and CBRE expanded into selling services to corporations eager to outsource real-estate operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather than expanding into this area, Grubb opted to branch into managing real-estate investments. It did so by merging in 2007 with closely held NNN Realty Advisors. NNN, formerly called Triple Net Properties, specialized in forming and managing real-estate investment trusts and managing tenant-in-common, or TIC, deals in which small investors collectively invest in commercial properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the merger, the TIC business has weighed on Grubb's financial results. The number of TIC deals, as well as fees resulting from them, plummeted in the recession because many small investors soured on such deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Grubb's TIC division generated a $6 million loss in operating income, according to research by JMP Securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When asked who spearheaded Grubb's merger with NNN, Mr. Kojaian said the entire board made the decision. "I look through the windshield, not the rearview mirror," he said. "We made a good decision at the time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics of Grubb said the firm suffered from lack of direction before and after Mr. Kojaian got involved. In the past 10 years, the brokerage has changed CEOs six times. Current CEO Thomas D'Arcy joined in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Grubb &amp; Ellis</span> declined to comment about its CEO turnover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, in a bid to boost its brokerage business, Grubb has increased the "split," the percentage of commissions that brokers get to keep. The firm hoped to attract better brokers by offering them roughly 65%, compared with the 50% to 55% being offered by other firms. But the move cut into the firm's profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kojaian remains optimistic. "We're positioned to be one of the beneficiaries of the improvement in the marketplace," he said.</p>
