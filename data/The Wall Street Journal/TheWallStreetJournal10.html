<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign home buyers in the Canadian city of Vancouver will face an additional 15% property transfer tax beginning next week, the provincial government of British Columbia said Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new tax legislation comes as concerns grow about skyrocketing prices [http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/canada-grapples-with-housing-bubble-risk-1453229761] in housing markets in Vancouver and Toronto and the role that foreign buyers may be playing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some real-estate officials say Chinese buyers, in particular, have helped fuel price increases for high-end Vancouver homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The benchmark price for a detached Vancouver home increased 39% to nearly 1.6 million Canadian dollars ($1.2 million) in June from a year earlier, according to the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on homes of that value, a foreign buyer would have to pay an extra C$240,000 under the new tax law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The new tax [http://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/taxes/property-taxes/property-transfer-tax/forms-publications/is-006-additional-property-transfer-tax-foreign-entities-vancouver.pdf], which is to take effect Aug. 2, will apply to foreign corporations and individuals buying residential properties in Vancouver. It is in addition to the province's general property transfer tax, the British Columbia government said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The general transfer tax equals 1% on the first C$200,000 of a home's value and 2% on the remaining value up to C$2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province will also allow the city of Vancouver to impose an annual vacancy tax on some residential properties that are left uninhabited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's federal government said this year that it would help fund an effort to collect data on the role of foreign buyers in the country's housing markets, which officials have acknowledged isn't well understood. Separately, Ottawa has taken steps [http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/canadian-prime-minister-vows-to-tackle-housing-affordability-1466109891] in recent years to limit risky borrowing, including a move to increase the minimum down payment required for more expensive homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province of British Columbia released preliminary data earlier this month suggesting that foreigners were involved in 5% of real-estate transactions in metropolitan Vancouver, accounting for 6.5% of the overall value. The data were collected over a period of 19 days in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Individuals who aren't citizens or permanent residents of Canada must file an Additional Property Transfer Tax Return at the time the transfer is registered, according to the provincial government. Those who don't pay could face a fine of C$100,000 for individuals or C$200,000 for corporations and up to two years in prison, the government said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Husky Energy Inc</span>. on Friday reported a second-quarter loss and a 58% decline in cash flow, hurt by lower oil prices and a drop in production[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/fires-cause-drop-in-canadian-oil-output-1462484697] following wildfires in Alberta[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/no-relief-from-canadian-wildfires-expected-wednesday-1463582022] and maintenance work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calgary, Alberta-based Husky said it swung to a net loss of 196 million Canadian dollars ($150 million), or 20 Canadian cents a share, marking the latest in a string of losses for the oil and gas producer as crude oil prices remain well below levels in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While down from a profit of C$120 million in the same year-ago quarter, the latest loss was smaller than the company's C$458 million first-quarter loss. Excluding items, the company said its adjusted loss was C$91 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have fortified our balance sheet, reduced our earnings break-even oil price and lowered our sustaining and maintenance capital requirements," Chief Executive Asim Ghosh said in a release.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Husky has completed a number of asset sales this year as it focuses on core resource plays in western Canada. Earlier this month, it closed the sale of a 65% stake[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/canadas-husky-energy-posts-another-quarterly-loss-1461629202] in pipeline and oil-storage facilities in Western Canada to two companies controlled by its top shareholder, Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, raising a total of C$1.7 billion. It also agreed in May to sell assets in southwest Saskatchewan for C$595 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On closing of its asset sales, Husky said its net debt will drop to below C$4.5 billion from about C$7 billion in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company said production in the quarter fell 6% to 316,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. Wildfires in northern Alberta in May forced Husky to shut down production at its Sunrise oil-sands operation, crimping production. Operations restarted last month and production is ramping up, it said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Husky maintained its annual production guidance at between 315,000 and 345,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, but expects it will be at the low end of the range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash flow for the quarter ended June 30 fell to C$488 million from C$1.18 billion a year earlier. It said its average realized price fell 30% to C$34.59 a barrel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company's results come a day after it shut down a pipeline after about 1,500 barrels of heavy crude mixed with a thinning agent spilled into a river in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. Husky didn't say if crude-oil output had been affected.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes rose to their fastest pace in nearly a decade in June amid low mortgage rates and an improving economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of existing-home sales increased 1.1% last month from May to a seasonally adjusted rate of 5.57 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said. That puts them at their highest level since February 2007. Sales for May were revised to 5.51 million from an initially reported 5.53 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has been boosted in recent months by strong job growth, improving wages and mortgage rates that have dipped near historic lows since Britain's decision to leave the <span class="companylink">European Union</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists had predicted the pace of home sales would moderate in 2016 due to a lack of homes for sale and lackluster economic growth. Thus far, the market has largely outperformed those expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, NAR economist Lawrence Yun said the market is likely to slow throughout the rest of the year. Pending contracts for home sales and foot traffic at open houses have both fallen recently. Inventory shortages are likely to depress purchases, even if demand remains strong.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Home building in the U.S. rebounded in June, a sign demand for housing continues to firm heading into the second half of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts rose 4.8% from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.189 million in June, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home building continues to gradually recover from the housing bust that accompanied the great recession," said PNC chief economist Stuart Hoffman. "Demand for new single-family homes is slowly but steadily improving."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That rising demand has led to concerns about the low inventory of new and existing homes on the market, which is pushing up prices and could weigh on further expansion. But Tuesday's report showed an estimated 1.015 million homes under construction in June, the highest level since February 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">June's uptick was driven by a jump in starts in the West and the Northeast, two of the pricier regions in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conditions underpinning demand are still in place, namely historically low interest rates and steady -- if slowly moderating -- job creation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starts on single-family homes, rose 4.4% in June from May, to 778,000. Starts on multifamily buildings with five or more units rose 1.6% to a rate of 392,000 in June from the prior month.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The son hasn't traveled recently to an area where Zika is being circulated by mosquitoes, he didn'thave sexual contact with an infected person, and the Aedes mosquitoes that can spread Zika aren't normally found in Utah, Angela Dunn, deputy state epidemiologist with the <span class="companylink">Utah Department of Health</span>, said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The son did help to care for his ailing father, and Dr. Dunn said the elderly man had "a very high level" of Zika virus in his blood. That raises the possibility that the son was infected through contact with bodily fluids of the father. That hasn't been identified before as a possible mode of transmission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Dunn identified the new case as a close family contact, but people familiar with the case confirmed that the contact is the deceased man's son. He has recovered, Dr. Dunn said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kim Mackrael   </div><div>1096 words</div><div>17 July 2016</div><div>20:07</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OTTAWA—Low interest rates around the world are fueling a familiar threat of housing bubbles, and central bankers in a number of key economies feel powerless to stop them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is being acutely felt in Canada, where home prices are soaring even as the country's energy- and mining-dependent economy slows. Sweden and Australia are dealing with similar surges in the value of homes, leading officials in all three countries to worry about the risk of a destabilizing bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Canada's hottest market, Vancouver, British Columbia, the benchmark home price rose 32% over the 12 months ended in June, with a typical detached home now costing 1.56 million Canadian dollars (US$1.2 million), according to a <span class="companylink">Canadian Real Estate Association</span> index. In Toronto, home prices were up 16% during the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those price gains in two of the country's biggest cities are likely unsustainable, the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> warned in June. Yet even as central bank Gov. Stephen Poloz worries about a potential bust, he said in an interview last week that rising home prices wouldn't prevent him from driving rates even lower if he believed that was needed to stimulate the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Poloz, whose bank has cut interest rates twice since January 2015, also acknowledged that Canada's ultralow-rate environment is helping to fuel rising house prices and household debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The risks are clearly rising," Mr. Poloz said, when asked whether the housing markets in Vancouver and Toronto are in a bubble. "I just don't know how big the risks are."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian housing officials have said foreign buyers are likely playing a significant role in the housing price increases, while real estate industry officials point to Chinese buyers in particular.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Poloz is among the central bankers who are increasingly caught between supporting their economies and addressing financial threats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their dilemma gets at a key question in central banking: Should monetary-policy makers stick to their primary goal of controlling inflation, or do they also need to use their powers to stop emerging asset bubbles before they get too big? There is little agreement on the point even after the U.S. housing crisis showed the consequences of leaving markets to deal with such problems themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is a kind of a shared issue," Mr. Poloz said of the risk of housing bubbles. "Low interest rates is something we all have in common, and that's going to cause these things to happen."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing bubbles can do economic damage by pulling investment into a relatively unproductive sector of the economy and piling up debt that can quickly go bad when prices deflate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Reserve Bank of Australia</span> warned in June that housing prices had begun to rise again after a May rate cut. Housing in Sydney, Australia's largest city, is already among the least affordable in the world, and the <span class="companylink">Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development</span> ranks Australia's household debt among the highest for developed countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the central bank held its interest rate steady at its policy meeting on July 5 and signaled in a statement that it may need to cut rates in the future. One reason is that inflation is running below the RBA's desired target, a predicament shared by its counterparts in the U.S., Europe and Japan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Australia's bank regulator has tried to address the risks of a bubble by implementing tougher guidelines for lending to property investors in the past year, which helped cool the growth in prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the <span class="companylink">OECD</span> warned last month that Australia may be nearing a "dramatic and destabilizing" end to its housing boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Sweden, rapidly rising house prices, fueled in part by 17 months of negative interest rates, also are generating concerns about the risk of a correction. Stockholm has become one of Europe's hottest property markets, one where prices rose 16% last year. The country has introduced measures aimed at limiting risky borrowing, but they haven't fully offset the lift from record-low interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Sweden's Riksbank</span> said on July 6 that its original plan to start raising interest rates by the middle of next year would likely be postponed, after the U.K. vote to leave the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> raised uncertainty about the outlook for global growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When policy rates globally are very low, it's not in the cards for us to embark on a path which is radically different,'' <span class="companylink">Riksbank</span> Gov. Stefan Ingves said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Poloz took over running the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> in 2013, when predecessor Mark Carney moved to the <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span> . <span class="companylink">Canada's central bank</span> held its key interest rate at 0.5% on Wednesday, as it downgraded its economic-growth forecast in response to a weaker investment outlook and sluggish exports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The central bank is only doing their job, which is to try to keep inflation on target," Mr. Poloz said in the interview. Weak growth since the financial crisis, he said, "has kept central banks in the game much longer than anyone would have expected."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central banker said rates are a blunt instrument that would require triggering a recession to slow down the housing market. Instead, he said, policy makers need to be responsible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada has tightened housing-financing rules five times since mid-2008 to curb excesses. Earlier this month, the country's main bank regulator issued a letter to lenders calling on them to ensure adequate internal controls on mortgage underwriting, including properly verifying borrowers' incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some economists suspect Mr. Poloz might consider cutting rates further were it not for the concern about housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're really stuck between a rock and a hard place," Bank of Nova Scotia economist Derek Holt said before Wednesday's rate decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Poloz disputes that housing concerns are preventing more cuts. He said his goal is to make sure the economy stays on a good growth track. The problem isn't rate cuts, he said, but their yearslong duration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Normally, it doesn't last long. You know, you might have a year or something while interest rates are lower than normal," Mr. Poloz said. "It's only when they last a long time that they begin to accumulate into something that is of concern."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Key data points this week include retail sales and consumer prices, while corporate earnings begin to ramp up with some key second-quarter reports from the railway and energy sectors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main economic indicators for the week are due out Friday in the form of May retails sales and June consumer prices. Analysts expect headline inflation to remain unchanged at 1.5% in June from May[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/canada-inflation-slowed-in-may-on-food-prices-1466170671], according to RBC Economics, while core year-over-year inflation is expected to slow to 2.0% from 2.1% in May. TD expects the latest CPI report to show a "modest increase" in gasoline prices and a rebound in food prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts expect retail sales for May to come in flat, according to RBC. TD, however, is guiding for a 0.3% increase from April[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/canadian-retail-sales-rose-in-april-1466603272], fueled by stronger auto sales and slightly higher gasoline prices. "Rising consumer prices in May will restrain retail volumes which are expected to be very subdued and therefore provide little support to industry-level real GDP," TD noted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the earnings front this week, reports from <span class="companylink">Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd</span>., <span class="companylink">Encana Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Husky Energy Inc</span>. are all due out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CP, which kicks off Canadian railway earnings on Wednesday, has already warned[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/canadian-pacific-warns-of-weaker-than-expected-results-1466516523] its second-quarter results would take a hit from lower shipping volumes due to the commodity swoon, wildfires in Alberta [http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/canada-wildfire-prompts-new-evacuation-of-oil-sands-workers-in-northern-alberta-1463473452]and a stronger Canadian dollar. It has guided for a 12% drop in revenue and around an 18% decline in adjusted per-share earnings. Analysts polled by <span class="companylink">Thomson Reuters</span> expect revenue of 1.47 billion Canadian dollars ($1.14 billion) and a profit of C$2.01 a share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the oil patch, <span class="companylink">Encana</span>'s second-quarter results are due out on Thursday, followed by <span class="companylink">Husky Energy</span> on Friday. According to CIBC World Markets, key themes for some energy firms will include stronger oil prices quarter-over-quarter and the effects of the Alberta wildfires in May. Analysts expect a loss of 9 cents a share from <span class="companylink">Encana</span>, according to <span class="companylink">Thomson Reuters</span>, while Husky is expected to post a loss of 20 cents a share for the quarter ended June 30.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Chris Kirkham </div><div>483 words</div><div>17 July 2016</div><div>20:46</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of new housing in the U.S. isn't keeping up with demand in part because of local delays in getting building permits approved, according to new research set to be released next week by real estate tracker <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study finds that in metro areas with longer delays in building and zoning approvals, developers are less quick to respond with new housing units when prices are rising and demand is high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Ultimately what really matters for builders, what really impacts them, is this delay," said Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>. "If builders know that it's going to take them a year to a year-and-a-half, and they think there will be downturn in that time, they'll just say ‘We're not going to build.'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family housing starts across the U.S. remain nearly 30% below the previous 30-year average, and <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>'s study found that the rate of home building relative to demand is also below historical averages. But the rate at which builders are bringing supply to the market as prices go up varies widely across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Places such as Las Vegas, Raleigh, N.C., and Atlanta have been able to meet rising demand with additional housing units over the past 20 years, the study found, while the new housing supply in markets such as Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco was much less responsive to rising prices over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McLaughlin correlated the rate of new housing supply with a land use and regulatory index developed by the <span class="companylink">University of Pennsylvania</span>, which measures the amount of delays and other forms of real estate regulation in markets across the country. He found that the longer the average delay in getting building permit approvals in a market, the less responsive the housing supply was during periods of increased demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas, Raleigh and Atlanta had average delays of about four months, compared with average delays of eight to 12 months in New York and coastal California markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frank Flores, development manager with Signature Development Group Inc. in Oakland, Calif., said his company expects at least six to nine months for building permit approvals in Oakland. The process can take much longer, he said, if a property also needs a new zoning designation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those delays are factored into the cost of doing business, Mr. Flores said, but they affect the decision-making on whether to proceed or hold off on certain projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've got an enormous housing shortage, and the only way to bring rents and pricing down is to get the market moving," he said. "Open the floodgates when the market is hot."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, investors will be watching for post-Brexit fallout in the U.K. and Europe as data reveals how the vote is affecting the regional economy. Also, the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> will make its first policy decision since the U.K.'s vote, <span class="companylink">Brazil's central bank</span> may send signals on a prospective rate cut later this year, and U.S. housing-market data should offer clues to whether the American economy is gathering pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WEDNESDAY: The <span class="companylink">European Commission</span>'s preliminary measure of consumer confidence for July in both the eurozone and the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> as a whole should provide evidence of how the U.K.'s Brexit vote might affect the Continent's economic outlook. The index is expected to show a weakening of sentiment, hinting at slower growth in consumer spending over coming months, with economists forecasting a fall to minus 8 from minus 7.3 in June. In Brazil, the central bank is largely expected to hold its 14.25% Selic benchmark rate steady, but investors will be listening for indications for when officials might cut borrowing costs as the country struggles to pull out of a recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THURSDAY: <span class="companylink">The ECB</span>'s governing council is seen following its counterparts at the <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span> and leaving policy unchanged, since <span class="companylink">the ECB</span>'s economists will be providing new forecasts in September accounting for the Brexit impact. But the bank may tweak its bond-buying program intended to spur weak lending. In the U.S., the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>' June existing-home sales data could prove the American housing market stands a strong chance of maintaining its momentum through the year. May's annualized sales pace, at 5.53 million, was the strongest since February 2007, but June is seen down a hair, to 5.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FRIDAY: Preliminary measures of activity in Europe's manufacturing and services sectors in July from Markit's purchasing managers indexes also will help show how Brexit is affecting the economy. For the first time, these will include a measure for the U.K., in addition to the readings for France, Germany and the eurozone. All are expected to record a softening of activity; the question is how severe and widespread the impact.</p>

</div><div class="author">By David George-Cosh </div><div>475 words</div><div>15 July 2016</div><div>11:17</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TORONTO—Sales of existing homes in Canada fell for the second consecutive month in June as fewer homes changed hands in two of the country's hottest markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Canadian Real Estate Association</span>, the industry group representing realtors across the country, on Friday said existing-home sales fell 0.9% from May. Sales in Canada's most closely watched areas of Vancouver and Toronto were down 5.3% and 1.2%, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monthly declines in the past two months have left sales activity 2.6% below a record set in April[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/canadian-housing-sales-extend-record-pace-in-april-1463407862], CREA said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing activity and prices throughout Canada, particularly in both Vancouver and Toronto, have been on a strong upward trajectory over the past few years, raising concerns among Canadian policy makers about a potential real estate bubble and prompting government efforts to tame conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> highlighted the sharp increases in Vancouver and Toronto home prices and said any expectations for continued growth in those markets may result in heightened sensitivity for a negative shock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's business as usual in Canada's housing market, with fire-breathing strength in Toronto and Vancouver, corrections playing out in the oil-exposed markets, while most others fall somewhere in between," <span class="companylink">BMO Capital Markets</span> said in a note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes were up 5.2% from a year earlier, but year-over-year increases have been steadily losing momentum since February, CREA said. According to the industry group, a total of 45,456 homes were sold in June, down from 45,889 in the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While national sales activity remains strong, there are still significant differences in housing market trends across Canada," CREA President Cliff Iverson said in a news release. ‘While home sales activity and price growth are running strong in B.C. and Ontario, they remain subdued in other markets where homebuyers are cautious and uncertain about the outlook for their local economy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National average prices for homes sold in June jumped 11.2% from a year earlier, to 503,301 Canadian dollars ($390,216). Excluding Vancouver and Toronto, which CREA said "are among Canada's tightest, most active and expensive housing markets," the year-over-year increase was a smaller 8.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, Statistics Canada said Canada's new-housing price index for single-dwelling, semidetached and row houses rose 0.7% in May [http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/canadian-new-home-prices-jump-1468504633]from the previous month. It also rose 2.7% from the same year-earlier period, its fastest pace in nearly nine years. The increase in house prices was largely led by the greater Toronto region as well as the metropolitan area of Vancouver.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Johnny Depp Relists French Estate for 50 Million Euros</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Johnny Depp is relisting his compound in the South of France for about 50 million euros, or about $55.5 million -- more than double its previous asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The actor's estate, a former village with more than a dozen buildings, first went on the market in June of 2015 with Cote d'Azur <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span> for roughly $26 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The listing was taken off the market after a few months, and is now being relisted with Rick Hilton of Hilton &amp; Hyland and Michael Zingraf of France-based Michael Zingraf Real Estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both firms are exclusive affiliates of <span class="companylink">Christie's International Real Estate</span>: Mr. Depp sold eight works by artist Jean-Michel Basquiat through <span class="companylink">Christie's</span> for a total of $14.6 million in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The actor is in the midst of a highly publicized divorce from actress Amber Heard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hilton said the "Pirates of the Caribbean" star thinks the property was priced too low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Mr. Depp feels that 50 million euros is the appropriate price for this asset," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added that the property is ideal for a buyer seeking privacy and that several billionaires have expressed interest in the estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alexander Kraft, CEO of Sotheby's International Realty France, said the original price was already "ambitious" considering the "rustic" nature of the property and its location. The property is roughly 17 miles outside the French Riviera resort town of Saint-Tropez.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Creator of Rockstar Energy Drink</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pays $20 Million In Miami Beach</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a home fit for a rock star. Russ Weiner, the youthful creator of Rockstar Energy Drink, paid $20 million in cash for a lavish Miami Beach property, according to his real-estate agent, Brett Harris of Douglas Elliman Real Estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The roughly 9,500-square-foot, seven-bedroom house sits on over an acre with a private dock on Biscayne Bay, a swimming pool and a gym. The home has an elevator, a wine cellar and a rooftop terrace. Near the swimming pool, there is a cabana and a covered outdoor kitchen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weiner liked that the property, which has about 160 feet of bay frontage, is one of the largest available lots on North Bay Road, Mr. Harris said. While he has an oceanfront home in Delray Beach, Mr. Weiner had been looking at homes in Miami for several years, Mr. Harris said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've been circling this property," Mr. Harris added. When it returned to the market at a reduced $24.9 million with David Hunt Solomon of EWM Realty International, he said, they made an offer. The home originally listed for $29.5 million in late 2013 with another firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sellers were Jared and Michelle Goldberg, according to public records. Mr. Harris said the Goldbergs had the home built around 2013, and are selling because they decided to move. Mr. Goldberg declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weiner, 46, launched Rockstar in the early 2000s. The energy drink found success with a 16-ounce can that helped set it apart from <span class="companylink">Red Bull</span>'s 8-ounce container. Mr. Weiner couldn't be immediately reached to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Onetime merv Griffin Estate in L.A. Asks $100 million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A fully furnished Beverly Hills estate once owned by Merv Griffin is going on the market for $100 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Built around 1940, the Georgian-style home sits on about 5 acres in prime Beverly Hills. The main house measures about 12,000 square feet with seven bedrooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was owned by Mr. Griffin, the late TV host, in the 1980s and 1990s, according to his son, Tony Griffin. The property has been restored and updated by its current owners: filmmaker Jefery Levy and fashion designer Pamela Skaist-Levy, co-founder of the labels Juicy Couture and Pam &amp; Gela.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale price includes the home's furnishings and art, including works by Robert Motherwell and Julian Schnabel, Mr. Levy said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The estate, listed with Josh Flagg of Rodeo Realty, includes a pine forest where a 1920s wooden cabin is nestled amid the trees, Mr. Levy said. A formal rose garden encompasses roughly another acre of the property. A separate building housing the gym is next to a sunken tennis court. There's a saltwater swimming pool, and the pool pavilion doubles as a movie screening room with space for about 100 people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple paid $17.5 million the house in 2005, according to public records. At the time, "it was in a terrible state," Mr. Levy said, noting that the house needed new plumbing and electrical systems. "It took us 10 years to really bring this house to where it is now." In total, Mr. Levy estimated they spent about $12 million updating the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said they're selling because their son will soon be headed to college and "it's a very big house for the two of us." Plus, several recent big-ticket home sales in Los Angeles -- including the Playboy mansion -- suggest that market conditions are favorable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said they've decided to sell the art and furniture because much of it was designed or selected specifically for the house. He said they plan to keep a home they own in Malibu and will likely buy a home in New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'Today' Show's Matt Lauer Lists for Nearly $18 million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After snapping up actor Richard Gere's waterfront <span class="companylink">Hamptons</span> estate, "Today" show co-anchor Matt Lauer is listing his nearby Sag Harbor home for $17.995 million, according to listing agent Susan Breitenbach of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With roughly 25 acres, the gated estate contains a six-bedroom house built by Mr. Lauer and his wife, Annette, around 2001. The traditional-style house measures approximately 8,000 square feet. The grounds also include a roughly 70-foot-long pool, a pool house and a tennis court, she said. There is another building lot on the property for a guesthouse; Ms. Breitenbach said she isn't sure whether the property could be subdivided.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lauer is in contract to buy Strongheart Manor, Mr. Gere's bay-front estate about 7 miles away in the village of North Haven. It had been listed for $36.5 million. Ms. Breitenbach, who is also the listing agent for that property, declined to reveal the sale price. The roughly 6-acre property first went on the market in 2013 with another firm asking $65 million. Ms. Breitenbach relisted the property about two months ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lauer is also listing a three-bedroom cottage he owns in Southampton for $3.95 million with Ms. Breitenbach. Mr. Lauer paid $2.15 million for the house in 2009. Bright Side Farm, his roughly 40-acre equestrian facility in Water Mill, isn't on the market.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Risk: Britain's Residential Property</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON -- A post-Brexit shutdown in the U.K. commercial-property market flared into the open this week. Mutual funds invested in offices and shops, which normally offer daily liquidity, closed their doors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the real risk isn't in commercial but residential real estate. If the small investors that have bought flats to let out also decide that the U.K. property gold rush is over, things really would get messy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six funds have now halted withdrawals, sometimes after abrupt valuation movements. M&amp;G, the fund-management arm of <span class="companylink">Prudential</span>, wrote its GBP 4.6 billion ($5.95 billion) property fund down by about 5.5% last week. <span class="companylink">Aberdeen Asset Management</span> decided not to raise the drawbridge, but instead demanded that sellers accept a 17% discount. The company reckons values have fallen about 7%; the extra 10% is the price of liquidity -- the haircut required to sell properties within a week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Open-ended property funds received GBP 8.1 billion from investors in 2013, 2014 and 2015. Managers needed to invest the cash, further stoking an already hot London market. Now some of these investors are bailing out, forcing managers to sell. Suspending redemptions won't stop this dynamic. The <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span>'s financial stability report, published Tuesday, presciently warned that the open-ended fund structure "could amplify any market adjustment."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The risk is that bad property debts clog up the banking system like they did in 2008. But banks are far better prepared than they were: The total stock of debt secured against U.K. commercial property is about a third lower than it was in 2007, and lending standards higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real nightmare scenario would be a parallel wave of investor selling in the residential market. So-called buy-to-let loans have been a major growth sector for U.K. banks, as investors have used cheap debt to chase house-price growth. They now account for 17% of all outstanding secured lending in the U.K.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If residential landlords follow mutual-fund investors out of the door, it could trigger a correction in Britain's notoriously high house prices. This is what the <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span> meant when it warned Tuesday that "buy-to-let investors could behave pro-cyclically, amplifying cycles in the housing market as a whole."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although borrowing against home equity remains subdued, homes form such a high share of the net worth of most Britons that this would still hit the consumer economy hard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent tax changes have made buy-to-let a less profitable business than it used to be. But with interest rates so low it probably remains cash-generative for the vast majority of landlords. That, combined with the difficulty and cost of selling homes, makes it more likely that investors will hold on to their assets. If prices do start falling, that could spur more sales, making the declines a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Think of the anxiety produced by redemptions from property funds, which have about GBP 35 billion in assets under management. Then imagine what would happen if selling began in buy-to-let, which received GBP 18.2 billion in loans in May alone. No wonder the <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span> is worried.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China Outflows Slow -- But Aren't Over</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beijing seems to be exercising restraint in the face of chaos in global financial markets. For now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's foreign-exchange reserves in June registered their biggest monthly increase in more than a year -- up $13.4 billion to $3.21 trillion. This happened while the yuan fell almost 1% last month.The consensus was that reserves would fall, but the increase is likely because China holds fewer British pounds or more Japanese yen than expected. The rise was largely cosmetic with the Japanese yen climbing almost 7% last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By keeping to a predictable path of weakening the yuan, Beijing hasn't sparked market panic as it did in January and in August of last year. It has also managed to slow capital flight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason outflows have slowed is that companies seem to have paid down a fair amount of their foreign-exchange liabilities. That eases fears that a substantial depreciation could hurt China's businesses. Another is that households are facing restrictions on taking money offshore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are signs that more is flowing out than meets the eye. An estimated $170 billion of yuan has, according to <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>, gone to the offshore Hong Kong market since last October. Put another way, since last October, about $500 billion net has flowed out. That is 50% more than the $330 billion implied by central-bank data, according to <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the positive month, Beijing hasn't halted the flight of capital out of China.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What Mobileye Technology Is Driving At</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors seem to have accepted the notion that the future of self-driving cars won't get here without many fits and starts. That bodes well for Mobileye.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week's report of the first fatal accident involving <span class="companylink">Tesla Motors</span>'s Autopilot feature could have posed a major problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mobileye's chips and software help power Tesla's automated driving features. The company's technology hasn't been implicated as being at fault, but the accident is serving as a stark reminder of the limitations of self-driving systems and the dangers posed when those systems lull drivers into taking their attention off the road.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That may dent the image of automated cars for now. Technology and auto companies are pressing on, though. A day after the accident was reported, Mobileye announced a partnership with <span class="companylink">BMW</span> and <span class="companylink">Intel</span> that aims to put a fully self-driving car on the road by 2021. Mobileye's stock is up more than 6% since the news.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, launching a fully automated car in five years' time seems a stretch when one of the most advanced vehicles on the road now can't detect an 18-wheeler blocking the highway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fortunately for Mobileye, it has significant prospects in less speculative areas. The company makes most of its money now from advanced driver-assistance systems, or ADAS, that provide features such as automatic parking and adaptive cruise control. That business alone is expected to grow briskly. Mobileye projects revenue will grow more than 40% annually -- hitting $1.1 billion by 2019 -- mostly on contracts it already has in place for ADAS features.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That doesn't mean there are no potholes ahead. Mobileye trades around 60 times forward earnings, with about 19% of its float sold short. But it also is much cheaper than Tesla as a play on the future of cars, and that future looks headed in the right direction.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forget negative or minuscule yields. Hong Kong is selling the highest-yielding triple-A government bonds in the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is a catch: The only people who can buy them are Hong Kong residents over 65 years old.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The semiautonomous Chinese city will sell three-year Silver Bonds, as they are called, that will pay out coupons linked to the city's inflation rate, which was 2.6% in May, with a minimum of 2%. The debt will yield more than government bonds with the same maturity in all of the 12 economies that enjoy triple-A ratings from <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hong Kong's own three-year yield, meanwhile, stands at about 0.5%. In years past, Hong Kong has refunded some of its regular budget surplus to all residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time, just the older generation with cash to invest will benefit.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Testifying before the Senate on June 21, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said the chances of the U.S. economy sliding into recession this year are "quite low." I agree. But the Fed still faces the difficult problem of what to do when the next downturn occurs if interest rates are still extremely low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed's traditional response to an economic slump is to cut rates sharply in order to stimulate interest-sensitive spending. When the U.S. economy headed into recession at the end of 2007, the Fed cut the short-term federal-funds rate by three percentage points within 12 months. But it can't do that anytime soon with short rates at less than 1%. And raising the federal-funds rate now to 3% or more would push the economy into recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, whether by accident or intent, Fed policy is headed down a path that could eventually solve this problem. The Fed's plan to continue a very easy monetary policy over the next few years is likely to drive the inflation rate to more than 3%. The Fed could then raise the federal-funds rate rapidly, reaching at least a 3% nominal rate, while still keeping a low or negative real fed-funds rate. This would put the Fed in a position to cut rates sharply when a new downturn occurred.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on the Fed's own numbers, the real federal-funds rate will still be negative at the end of 2017. All of this is aimed at driving down the unemployment rate to only 4.6% in 2018, the median of the Federal Open Market Committee's projections. Since that rate is less than the 4.8% rate Fed policy makers judge to be the long-term sustainable rate, their projections of unemployment imply that inflation will continue to rise beyond the Fed's stated 2% target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the Fed succeeds in achieving this -- raising the inflation rate above 3% and then raising the fed-funds rate close to that level without pushing the economy into recession -- it will have solved the problem of having a high-enough fed-funds rate to deal with a traditional economic downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial markets may of course get nervous if the Fed continues to have a very low interest rate even after it has achieved its dual goals of low unemployment and a 2% inflation rate. But the Fed could then argue that the 2% inflation rate was never intended as a ceiling but as an average rate to be achieved over time. Since annual inflation has been below 2% for more than three years, it would arguably be consistent with the Fed's goal to have inflation temporarily above 2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, this path of future inflation and interest rates may not be what the Fed has in mind. But it does look consistent with the Fed's current actions and its projected plans for interest rates over the next two years. It would be a clever policy but it would also be a policy of high-risk fine-tuning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's risky because the financial markets may not be convinced that the Fed will act to reverse an inflation rate that has drifted above 3% and continues to rise. That could cause long-term interest rates to rise sharply, leading to declines in the prices of equities and of commercial real estate. The resulting higher mortgage rates would depress house prices and housing demand. The higher long-term interest rates would also inflict large losses on bondholders who had bought long-term bonds with very low coupons. These financial losses could precipitate an economic downturn. Fed actions to cut its newly increased fed-funds rate might not be enough to reverse that downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is the alternative? It's not helpful now to say that the Fed should have started to normalize short-term rates back in 2014. But there is no reason for the Fed to continue to aim for a negative real fed-funds rate through 2017 in an economy that is already essentially at full employment and experiencing a rising rate of inflation. The Fed could now accelerate the planned increase in short rates, limiting the rise in inflation. The higher real interest rates would also reduce the incentive for investors and lenders to reach for yield in ways that create risks of financial instability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the U.S. economy does experience the next economic downturn, economic recovery need not depend on monetary policy alone. The appropriate response would add a short-term fiscal stimulus combined with longer-term reductions in spending that would prevent a net increase in the out-year deficits. Once the coming election is behind us, it would be good for the next president and the Congress to design such a fiscal package so that legislative action could happen promptly when it is needed.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tyra Banks is selling her Los Angeles home for $6.4 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The model-turned-entrepreneur listed the Spanish Colonial Revival house [http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/model-tyra-banks-lists-los-angeles-home-for-7-75-million-1443115156] for $7.75 million last September with Heidi Lake of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>, then reduced the price to $6.9 million before taking it off the market. Ms. Banks relisted the home about a month ago with a new price of $6.5 million, Ms. Lake said, and found a buyer "immediately." The deal is slated to close next week, she said. Ms. Banks could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyer is an American businessman who is returning to the United States with his family after a stint in Europe, according to his agent, Richard Maslan of Hilton &amp; Hyland. Mr. Maslan declined to name the purchasers but said the family had been looking for a Spanish-style home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Built in the 1920s, the four-bedroom house is located in the Beverly Hills Post Office area and measures about 6,000 square feet. Ms. Banks purchased it in 2004 for $3.085 million, according to public records. She then spent approximately $2 million renovating it and lived there for about 11 years before moving to another house in Malibu.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It feels like the market has picked up a little bit," said Ms. Lake of the sale.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Charles Duxbury </div><div>735 words</div><div>6 July 2016</div><div>13:06</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STOCKHOLM—Britain's Brexit vote and people like Alexander Horre have created a volatile mix for <span class="companylink">Sweden's central bank</span> and its negative-rate policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mr. Horre realized recently he would need to fork out an additional 15% to win the bidding on an apartment in his favorite part of Stockholm, he called his bank. In no time and over the phone, his lender arranged for a bigger mortgage, allowing him to acquire the place for the equivalent of $505,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such transactions have the <span class="companylink">Swedish Riksbank</span> increasingly nervous that its 16-month experiment with negative interest rates is yielding the kind of undesired byproduct that textbooks often predict: a real-estate bubble. Stockholm has become one of Europe's hottest property markets, one where prices rose 14% last year and money keeps flowing thanks to the central bank's ultraloose interest rate of minus-0.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To cool demand for mortgage loans, the <span class="companylink">Riksbank</span> had been planning to start increasing interest rates by the middle of next year. But the central bank said on Wednesday that turbulence created by the U.K.'s plan to leave the European Union[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-k-projected-to-leave-european-union-1466740486] had hurt its confidence in the global economic outlook, adding that any tightening of monetary policy would likely have to be postponed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Riksbank</span> Gov. Stefan Ingves said he couldn't look only at the local Swedish situation given the stances of much larger central banks. The <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span> has already signaled it may cut interest rates over the summer[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/boes-mark-carney-hints-at-summer-rate-cut-1467299787] to cushion the effects of the Brexit vote. Policy makers at the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> have long said they want to gradually raise rates this year, but recently they have cited the U.K. vote and weakening domestic data as reasons for caution as they assess the outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When policy rates globally are very low," Mr. Ingves said in an interview, "it's not in the cards for us to embark on a path which is radically different."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sweden is a striking example of a dilemma facing a small number of affluent corners of the globe, such as Denmark and Switzerland. These countries have strong economies with relatively low unemployment, and would appear to be in no need of monetary stimulus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Central banks in those three countries have driven benchmark rates below zero—long considered an inviolable floor on rates—in bids to keep their currencies in synchrony with a falling euro. Now, even though there are concerns about undesirable side effects, such as fast-rising housing prices[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/the-upside-down-world-of-negative-interest-rates-1460643111], they aren't rushing to tighten monetary policies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is a small-open-economy problem," said Carmen Reinhart, a professor of economics at Harvard University. "While the authorities have been cognizant that households have been taking on record levels of debt, their monetary policy has done nothing but encourage it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sweden has taken a number of steps to ease the risk posed by the housing market. Policy makers hope those moves can counteract the effects of low rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The country has introduced a requirement that home buyers make a down payment equivalent to 15% of a home price. And, as of last month, households taking mortgages of more than 50% of the value of the home must pay down the principal, not just the interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The country has also launched a program of house building, hoping that greater supply will ease the pressure on prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ingves, the governor, has recommended that a 30% reduction all Swedes get on their mortgage costs through a tax-deduction program be removed. But successive governments have been reluctant to take such a politically sensitive measure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some policy makers, including the head of the financial-services watchdog, known as FI, have said that it will be hard for regulatory measures to bite when interest rates remain at record lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Sweden is still a hothouse for debt growth," FI head Erik Thedeen said in a recent speech.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Horre, the new Stockholm homeowner, is anxiously waiting to see whether prices keep rising or whether he has bought at the top of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My friends tell me not to worry," he said. "But I check the financial pages of the newspaper every day."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Martin Feldstein </div><div>901 words</div><div>5 July 2016</div><div>19:55</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Testifying before the Senate on June 21, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said the chances of the U.S. economy sliding into recession this year are "quite low." I agree. But the Fed still faces the difficult problem of what to do when the next downturn occurs if interest rates are still extremely low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed's traditional response to an economic slump is to cut rates sharply in order to stimulate interest-sensitive spending. When the U.S. economy headed into recession at the end of 2007, the Fed cut the short-term federal-funds rate by three percentage points within 12 months. But it can't do that anytime soon with short rates at less than 1%. And raising the federal-funds rate now to 3% or more would push the economy into recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, whether by accident or intent, Fed policy is headed down a path that could eventually solve this problem. The Fed's plan to continue a very easy monetary policy over the next few years is likely to drive the inflation rate to more than 3%. The Fed could then raise the federal-funds rate rapidly, reaching at least a 3% nominal rate, while still keeping a low or negative real fed-funds rate. This would put the Fed in a position to cut rates sharply when a new downturn occurred. ​</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on the Fed's own numbers, the real federal-funds rate will still be negative at the end of 2017. All of this is aimed at driving down the unemployment rate to only 4.6% in 2018, the median of the Federal Open Market Committee's projections. Since that rate is less than the 4.8% rate Fed policy makers judge to be the long-term sustainable rate, their projections of unemployment imply that inflation will continue to rise beyond the Fed's stated 2% target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the Fed succeeds in achieving this—raising the inflation rate above 3% and then raising the fed-funds rate close to that level without pushing the economy into recession—it will have solved the problem of having a high-enough fed-funds rate to deal with a traditional economic downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial markets may of course get nervous if the Fed continues to have a very low interest rate even after it has achieved its dual goals of low unemployment and a 2% inflation rate. But the Fed could then argue that the 2% inflation rate was never intended as a ceiling but as an average rate to be achieved over time. Since annual inflation has been below 2% for more than three years, it would arguably be consistent with the Fed's goal to have inflation temporarily above 2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, this path of future inflation and interest rates may not be what the Fed has in mind. But it does look consistent with the Fed's current actions and its projected plans for interest rates over the next two years. It would be a clever policy but it would also be a policy of high-risk fine-tuning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's risky because the financial markets may not be convinced that the Fed will act to reverse an inflation rate that has drifted above 3% and continues to rise. That could cause long-term interest rates to rise sharply, leading to declines in the prices of equities and of commercial real estate. The resulting higher mortgage rates would depress house prices and housing demand. The higher long-term interest rates would also inflict large losses on bondholders who had bought long-term bonds with very low coupons. These financial losses could precipitate an economic downturn. Fed actions to cut its ​newly increased fed-funds rate might not be enough to reverse that downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is the alternative? It's not helpful now to say that the Fed should have started to normalize short-term rates back in 2014. But there is no reason for the Fed to continue to aim for a negative real fed-funds rate through 2017 in an economy that is already essentially at full employment and experiencing a rising rate of inflation. The Fed could now accelerate the planned increase in short rates, limiting the rise in inflation. The higher real interest rates would also reduce the incentive for investors and lenders to reach for yield in ways that create risks of financial instability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the U.S. economy does experience the next economic downturn, economic recovery need not depend on monetary policy alone. The appropriate response would add a short-term fiscal stimulus combined with longer-term reductions in spending that would prevent a net increase in the out-year deficits. Once the coming election is behind us, it would be good for the next president and the Congress to design such a fiscal package so that legislative action could happen promptly when it is needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Feldstein, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Ronald Reagan, is a professor at Harvard and a member of the Journal's board of contributors.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clears Senate Hurdle</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bipartisan Puerto Rico debt-relief bill survived a key vote in the Senate on Wednesday, putting it on track for final passage before Friday, when Puerto Rico's government says it will default on its most senior debt payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bill cleared a Senate procedural hurdle on a 68-to-32 vote. Sixty votes were needed to advance the measure. A final vote, requiring a simple majority, was expected later Wednesday or on Thursday. The legislation creates a process to handle what could be the largest municipal-debt workout in U.S. history.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors index suffered its first annual decline since August 2014. A headline in the online version of this story erroneously said it was the first annual decline since May 2015. (July 27)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—A gauge of upcoming home sales slid in May, a possible sign of slowing in the U.S. housing market heading into the summer months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>' pending home sales index, which tracks contract signings for purchases of previously owned homes, d ecreased a seasonally adjusted 3.7%[http://www.realtor.org/topics/pending-home-sales] in May from the prior month, the trade group said Wednesday. Sales typically close within a month or two of signing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a more modest decline of 2.0%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index was 110.8 in May, down from a downwardly revised 115.0 in April and little changed from March's 110.7 reading. The gauge was down 0.2% last month compared with May 2015, its first annual decline since August 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">May's decline in pending sales followed a similarly sharp April rise, said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. More broadly, "housing demand is rising as the labor market improves and renting becomes even more expensive," he said in a note to clients. "But progress will not be rapid, with mortgage lending standards still tight."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, the NAR's chief economist, also pointed to tight inventory and fast-rising prices as mounting problems for the housing sector. "Realtors are acknowledging with increasing frequency lately that buyers continue to be frustrated by the tense competition and lack of affordable homes for sale in their market," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing sector has posted solid gains in recent years, helping lift overall economic growth. The market's long postrecession recovery has been supported by historically low interest rates, which have moved even lower so far this year. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in May was 3.60%, down from 3.87% in January, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned U.S. homes rose in May at its fastest pace[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-rise-to-fastest-pace-since-2007-1466604369] since February 2007, the Realtors group said last week. Sales of newly built single-family homes, which are a small fraction of the overall market, rose 6.4% in the first five months of the year[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/pace-of-u-s-new-home-sales-slows-in-may-1466690670] compared with the same period in 2015, according to Commerce Department data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-building activity has been rising, too. Housing starts in the first five months of 2016 were up 10.2% compared with the same period a year earlier[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-housing-starts-fell-0-3-in-may-1466166942], including a 14.5% increase in the construction of single-family homes, according to the Commerce Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, as Mr. Yun noted Wednesday, the supply of available homes has remained tight, which is putting upward pressure on prices. At the end of May, there was a 4.7-month supply of unsold existing homes and a 5.3-month supply of newly built homes at the current sales paces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>, in its June 15 policy statement[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/fed-leaves-policy-rate-unchanged-lowers-outlook-for-increases-1466013979], noted that "the housing sector has continued to improve" since the start of the year. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen told lawmakers last week that "housing has continued to recover gradually, aided by income gains and the very low level of mortgage rates."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's pending home sales declined in May across the country, led by a 5.3% drop in the Northeast and a 4.2% decline in the Midwest. Pending sales were down 3.4% in the West and 3.1% in the South compared with April. On an annual basis, sales in May were down in the Midwest, a bit lower in the West, flat in the Northeast and up slightly in the South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> will release existing-home-sales data for June on July 21. MFR Inc. Chief U.S. Economist Joshua Shapiro said Wednesday's report "points to little change" in June sales.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices continued rising at a steady clip in April, a reassuring signal of strength in the U.S. economy amid global uncertainty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index, covering the entire nation, rose 5% in the 12 months ended in April, slightly less than a 5.1% increase in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-city index gained 4.7% from a year earlier compared with 4.8% last month, and the 20-city index gained 5.4% year-over-year, compared with 5.5% in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected a 5.7% increase in the 20-city index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After years of volatility, home prices have grown at a rate of around 5% since early 2015. Strong growth in home prices along with growing demand for new homes have helped make the housing market one of the strongest sectors of the U.S. economy in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hottest markets in the country, primarily on the West Coast, continued to show double-digit price gains, with Portland reporting a 12.3% year-over-year gain, Seattle showing a 10.7% rise[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/in-silicon-seattle-high-home-prices-1461163535], and Denver with a 9.5% increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More cities have surpassed the highs they hit during the housing boom, including Denver, Dallas, Portland, San Francisco, Seattle, Charlotte and Boston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Month-over-month prices the U.S. Index rose 1% in April before seasonal adjustment, the 20-city index increased 1.1% and the 10-city index rose 1% from March to April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After seasonal adjustment, the national index rose 0.1% month-over-month, the 10-City index posted a 0.3% increase, and the 20-City index reported a 0.5% month-over-month rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The impact on the housing market of Britain's decision to exit the European Union[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/global-markets-steadier-after-brexit-related-rout-1467099488] and the ensuing turmoil in global financial markets is likely to be mixed. On the one hand, falling yields on U.S. Treasurys[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/government-bond-yields-sink-as-investors-flock-to-safety-1467037489] are helping to push mortgage rates lower. Several lenders posted rates for 30-year fixed mortgages of about 3.5% on Monday, near their lowest levels in several years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If mortgage rates remain low, it makes monthly payments more affordable and can help push up home prices or encourage buyers who are on the sidelines to decide to purchase a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But on the other hand, it could undercut consumer confidence and have a slight negative impact on the U.S. economy, making people hesitate to go out[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/home-price-surge-stymies-first-time-buyers-1461317401] and make a major purchase such as a home.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Sales of new homes slipped in May, but the pace was still the second best for a month since the recession ended, behind April's jump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Purchases of new, single-family homes[http://www.census.gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/construction/nrs/index.html] fell 6% in May from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 551,000, the Commerce Department said Thursday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">April's rate was cut to 586,000 from an initially estimated 619,000 but still rose 12.3% from March. April's rate was still the fastest pace since February 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Through the volatility, the trend still looks upward," said Jim O'Sullivan, economist at High Frequency Economics. Year to date, new-home sales advanced 6.4% compared with the same period in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New homes make up just a tenth of all home purchases, and figures are often subject to large revisions. May's report came with a margin of error of plus or minus 12.8 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Broadly, other data show the housing market as a bright spot in an otherwise choppy economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Sales of existing homes[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-rise-to-fastest-pace-since-2007-1466604369] rose to their highest level in more than nine years, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Wednesday. A separate Commerce Department report showed that newly started home construction[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-housing-starts-fell-0-3-in-may-1466166942] was well above year-earlier levels in May, though the pace slipped slightly from April. Spending on home construction and remodeling grew at the fastest pace in more than three years at the start of 2016, helping support an otherwise lackluster quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consistent employment gains and low mortgage rates are supporting the housing market. While hiring slowed in May[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-added-only-38-000-jobs-in-may-1464957215], the economy has been adding jobs for 6½ years. A 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 3.54% for the week ended June 16, down from 4% a year earlier, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rick Fletcher, vice president of sales and marketing at MBK Homes in Irvine, Calif., said several of the company's communities exceeded sales expectations during the spring selling season, when the real-estate market tends to pick up as families look to settle into school districts for the fall. He expects that pace to continue through the rest of the year because “There just aren't enough houses, especially in Southern California."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week major public builders <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> both posted double-digit increases in the value of new orders and home deliveries for the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">May's new-homes sales pace, meanwhile, keeps the market on track to beat 2015's total 501,000 new homes, the highest annual level since 2007. But the month's rate remains below the annual average of 653,000 on records back to 1963.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, two recent trends in the new-home market, higher prices and shrinking inventories, reversed in the latest data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a new home—the point at which half of homes were sold above and half sold below—was $290,400 last month. That was down from April, and up 1% from a year earlier. Prices aren't adjusted for seasonal factors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's report showed that inventories of new homes expanded in May. Based on the current sales pace, it would take 5.3 months to exhaust the supply of new homes on the market, compared with 4.9 months during the prior month. The total number of new homes for sale at the end of the month was 244,000, the highest figure since September 2009.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of existing homes rose to their highest level in more than nine years and prices climbed to a new peak in May, the latest sign of rising demand amid steady job creation and low interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales climbed 1.8% in May from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.53 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Wednesday. That was the strongest pace since February 2007. April's sales figure was revised down to 5.43 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national median sale price for a previously owned home, meanwhile, was $239,700, up 4.7% from a year earlier and the highest figure recorded by the Realtors' group.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Low inventory, especially for starter and tradeup homes, continues to stifle home sales activity," said Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist at real estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for homes has been especially strong as wages edge higher and mortgage rates remain historically low.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the cost of flour is higher than the price of bread, what should a baker do? Chinese property developers are choosing to buy more flour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices for land, the main ingredient of the property world, have hit record highs in auctions this year in many Chinese cities. The average land price per square meter for the top 100 cities in the first five months of this year jumped by nearly 50% from the same period last year, according to Wind Information. In fact, some land prices are even higher than housing prices nearby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">State-owned developer Poly Real Estate, for instance, bought a piece of land in a Shanghai suburb for 5.5 billion yuan ($835 million) last month. This translates to roughly 44,000 yuan per square meter of buildable space. Houses in the region meanwhile only go for approximately 40,000 yuan per square meter. After taking into account the construction costs, taxes and other expenses, property prices would have to nearly double for the developer to make money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime land in the biggest cities always costs a lot, but increasingly the voracious buyers are showing up in less prime locations and smaller cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Suzhou, a city near Shanghai, with a population of 1.1 million, land sales in the first five months of this year already have exceeded the total of last year. And the average prices have doubled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the buyers of the most expensive parcels are state-owned enterprises. A property subsidiary of <span class="companylink">China Gezhouba Group</span>, a state-owned builder of power plants and dams, spent 3.3 billion yuan last month to buy the most expensive land, in terms of price per square meter, in Nanjing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another state dam-construction company, <span class="companylink">Power Construction Corp</span>. of China, snapped up a piece of land in China's bubbliest property market, the southern metropolis of Shenzhen, for 8.3 billion yuan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Cinda Real Estate</span>, a subsidiary of state-owned "bad bank" <span class="companylink">China Cinda Asset Management</span>, has splurged on at least 35 billion yuan of land just over the past year, even though the market value of the company, which is listed in Shanghai, is just 7.3 billion yuan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To fund the purchases, Cinda's net debt has swelled to more than three times its shareholders' equity. Nevertheless, it still managed to raise three billion yuan last month in a bond financing at 5.5%, mostly because of its state backing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The domestic bond market and growth in asset-backed securities have made financing easier for developers, causing companies to chase whatever assets they can.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Continuing overhauls of state-owned enterprises also could be a spur for investment as these firms have incentives to inflate their balance sheets to gain clout in consolidation talks. For some companies that already have invested heavily in real estate, keeping land prices high makes sense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, instead of overpaying, developers should do as the baker would and stop making bread.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That had been a nickname for Chinese developers paying sky-high prices for land parcels during China's property boom earlier this decade, which left so-called ghost cities of unsold housing across China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, with housing prices in China's larger cities again rising rapidly, frothy bids for land parcels are back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On June 8, <span class="companylink">Logan Property Holdings Co</span>. agreed to pay 14.1 billion yuan ($2.14 billion) for a piece of land in Shenzhen's Guangming district, the largest-ever price tag in the southern Chinese city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Logan says it didn't overpay, calling the price “relatively favorable" in a hot market.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Heard on the Street: Why China's Developers Can't Stop Overpaying for Property[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/why-chinas-developers-cant-stop-overpaying-for-property-1466385119]
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier in June, a joint venture between two firms, one of which is backed by state-owned <span class="companylink">Power Construction Corp</span>. of China, outbid 17 rivals with an 8.3 billion yuan offer for a plot in Shenzhen's Longhua district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The soaring land prices show the challenges facing the government as it tries to prevent property bubbles. Moves to stimulate China's slowing economy and to trim excess housing in smaller cities across the country—such as interest-rate cuts and eased mortgage rules—have fed into speculative demand for homes in top-tier cities that are now scrambling to cool prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average housing prices in 70 Chinese cities were about 5% higher in May than a year earlier, the fifth straight month of increases. In top-tier cities, prices were up 19% to 53%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But land prices are shooting up not just in Shenzhen, Shanghai and Beijing, but also in lower-profile cities such as Hangzhou, Hefei and Zhengzhou.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials face a dilemma in trying to tame land prices: Land is commonly used as debt collateral; a sharp drop in valuation could trigger defaults and produce a wave of bad loans, hurting the economy. On the other hand, runaway land prices make it harder for ordinary Chinese to afford apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Suzhou and Nanjing, bidding wars at land auctions have compelled the authorities to cap land prices. To find another way in, bidders now compete on the volume of affordable housing they are willing to commit to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For developers, it is also a tricky game, as land could end up being more expensive than any housing that can be erected on it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In some cases, the price of flour is more expensive than the price of bread," said Chen Sheng, a Shanghai-based analyst who heads the government-backed China Real Estate Data Academy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also concern that financial firms with little experience as builders are viewing land as an opportunity for arbitrage. After winning an auction, financial firms with access to cheap funding can apply for a loan with the land as collateral, and use that to extend a construction loan at a higher rate to a partner, which is typically a property developer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ministry of Land and Resources is seeking to rein in the bidding wars. The message is, “Don't blindly drive up land prices," said a property executive with knowledge of the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is a challenging task.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There's not much that can be done to cool the land market even if there is some sort of madness that developers are engaging in," said Nicole Wong, a property analyst at CLSA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts say the higher land prices are eroding property developers' profit margins, but the firms say they have no choice but to replenish their land banks in cities that are showing signs of growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Cinda Real Estate Co</span>., the Shanghai-listed arm of <span class="companylink">China Cinda Asset Management</span>, has gobbled up five land parcels in Shanghai, Hangzhou and Shenzhen since November, ringing up a bill as high as 31.8 billion yuan, according to stock-exchange filings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within a span of five days recently, Cinda defeated more than 20 rivals to win two land auctions in Hangzhou and Shanghai, submitting bids totaling 18.1 billion yuan. Cinda says it has a 50% stake in the Hangzhou project, without naming its joint-venture partner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's actually normal business behavior. People are making a big fuss," said a real-estate executive at Cinda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent weeks, Shanghai-based property developer China Jinmao Holdings Group Ltd., a subsidiary of state-owned <span class="companylink">Sinochem Group</span>, purchased four land plots in Hangzhou, Shenzhen and Nanjing alongside other partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Moody's Investors Service</span> estimates that Jinmao could have incurred a total bill of up to 15 billion yuan for these projects, or the equivalent of 11% of the company's total assets at the end of 2015, warning that the purchases will weaken the company's liquidity and that the high cost of the plots will squeeze its profit margins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jinmao, which has participated in more than 30 land auctions so far this year, said it remains in good financial shape and that the land purchases won't put too much pressure on its balance sheet. In a statement, it called its entry into the Shenzhen market “a strategic move."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We maintain a cautious approach for all land purchases," Jinmao said in the statement.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Home building in the U.S. slowed a little in May, more evidence that the supply of new houses will have trouble keeping up with steady demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts fell 0.3% from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.164 million in May, the Commerce Department said Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has been one of the economy's bright spots in recent months as low mortgage rates and a long stretch of job creation push more Americans toward buying a home. Builders have responded by breaking ground on more projects during much of this year but activity remains well below historical norms, leading to thin inventories and rising prices, factors keeping some would-be buyers at bay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Single-family starts remain badly depressed from a longer-term perspective but have shown more recent strength," said Ted Wieseman, economist at Morgan Stanley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starts on single-family homes, which account for roughly two-thirds of new construction, rose 0.3% in May. Starts on structures with two or more units, which include apartments and condominiums, sank 1.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New applications for building permits, a bellwether for forthcoming construction, increased 0.7% to 1.138 million, from a revised April rate of 1.130 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected housing starts and building permits both to clock in at a rate of 1.15 million in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-starts figures are volatile and often revised. May's figure came with a margin of error of plus or minus 14 percentage points. New-home starts were revised down to 1.167 million from an initially reported 1.172 million in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the small decline in May, there are plenty of signs that builders are trying to feed home buyers' demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts in May were 9.5% above the same month one year earlier. Through the first five months of the year, starts are up 10.2% compared with the same period in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family housing starts are up 14.5% in the first five months of 2016, compared with the same period a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the number of homes under construction—regardless of when ground was broken—hit the highest level since February 2008 last month. The number of single-family homes under construction was the highest since October 2008 and the number of buildings with five or more units was the highest since October 1974.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The number of new homes under construction continues to rise, which will help to support rising new-home sales over time," said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities. “Thus, the housing sector continues to be one of the bright lights of a very mixed economic picture."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with steady gains, construction levels for new homes remain historically low. From 1970 through the end of 2000, a span that includes five recessions, starts averaged more than 1.5 million a year. Single-family starts averaged more than 1 million during the same decades, significantly higher than the 764,000 pace last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other housing indicators point to a relatively healthy market. New-home sales posted their strongest month in more than eight years in April, according to separate data from Commerce. The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> last month said existing-home sales[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-rose-in-april-1463753517], which account for the bulk of the market, rose for the second straight month in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steady demand is leading to higher prices. The S&amp;P/Case-Shiller national home-price index showed home prices approaching their 2006 peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But builders complain about shortages of lots and labor, factors constraining the supply of new homes. Stricter lending standards since the financial crisis also have made it tougher for lower earners to qualify for mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has led to a focus on building bigger, more expensive homes.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rents and rates matter for apartment construction. But so does supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is now a decade since the housing bust began, but new-home construction remains weak. Economists reckon construction figures due Friday from the Commerce Department will show that an annualized 1.15 million homes were started last month, versus 1.17 million in April, adjusted for seasonal swings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is better than the 554,000 started in 2009. But even in the 1960s, when the working-age population was half what it is now, housing starts averaged one-fifth higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overall number is weak because developers are building far fewer single-family homes. By contrast, apartment construction has made a complete recovery. In April, an annualized 373,000 homes were started in projects with five or more residences, well above levels that prevailed prior to the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the apartment-building boom may be in for a cooling-off period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strength in apartment construction is due to a confluence of factors. First, even though rates are low, it is still hard for many first-time home buyers to qualify for a mortgage. So as more Americans have started households of their own, they are renting apartments instead of buying houses. The subsequent increase in rents has made becoming a landlord an attractive proposition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem, says Bank of America Merrill Lynch economist Michelle Meyer, is that much of the recent apartment construction has been concentrated in luxury buildings in the largest U.S. cities. Now it looks as if these high-end markets may become oversupplied. Indeed, the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s most recent survey of loan officers showed tightening lending standards for multifamily commercial real estate -- an indication that banks may view funding luxury apartments as a riskier proposition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There still is plenty of demand for more affordable rentals, but before the market can start meeting that builders will need to change their focus.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York City made a bid on Thursday to complete a long-promised park along the Brooklyn waterfront, offering $100 million to buy the huge CitiStorage complex that was badly damaged by fire last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CitiStorage's owners didn't accept the $100 million offer at a meeting on Thursday, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later, a broker for the owners noted that the property has been on the market since April, with an asking price of $325 million, as a prime development site for a 15-story, 600,000-square-foot office or commercial complex.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We are delighted to include them in our process," said Paul J. Massey Jr., who is president of New York Investment Sales at <span class="companylink">Cushman &amp; Wakefield</span> and represents CitiStorage.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the offer itself was hailed by local elected officials who have been pressing Mayor Bill de Blasio to move forward on plans to complete the 27-acre Bushwick Inlet Park in Williamsburg and Greenpoint that the city committed in 2005 to build.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January 2015, a CitiStorage warehouse on the site burned for more than 24 hours, sending a blizzard of singed paperwork over Williamsburg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a letter to the owners of the property sent on Thursday, Deputy Mayor Alicia Glen said that the fire “has brought increased focus on these properties, and the City would like to reopen discussions and come to an agreement on acquiring the CitiStorage site."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The park was an amenity promised by the administration of Michael Bloomberg when the city rezoned much of the waterfront area, setting off a building boom of luxury high-rise residential developments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the park was delayed for years, while property values rose. A sports field opened in 2010, and a park office and playground opened a few years later in a corner of the future park. But the CitiStorage site, with 6.75 acres, cut the planned park site in half. It was mapped as park land in the 2005 rezoning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Natalie Grybauskas, a spokeswoman for the mayor, said the offer comes to about $3 million more per acre than the price paid for other parcels in the park. She said the property would be worth far more if zoned residential, but that no rezoning would be permitted without support from the surrounding community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Councilman Stephen Levin of Brooklyn said “there is absolutely no chance of a rezoning."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The de Blasio administration has really stepped up and has taken a great step forward," he said. “This is proof that the city's commitments carry through from one administration to another."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The offer, if eventually accepted, would bring the total cost of the park to about $325 million, plus $22 million already allocated for demolition and environmental cleanup, making it one of the most expensive parks in the city even before it is built out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brooklyn Bridge Park, at about three times the size, has cost about $400 million to date.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $100 million appropriation for the purchase was included in Mayor de Blasio's budget as an acquisition cost, but no details were specified.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The offer was made a day after the city council and Mr. de Blasio agreed on the budget.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON—U.K. house prices are predicted to fall this summer for the first time in four years, with property brokers widely blaming uncertainty over the coming referendum[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/specialcoverage/eureferendum]  on Britain's membership of the [http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/specialcoverage/eureferendum] European Union[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/specialcoverage/eureferendum] .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors</span> said Thursday that more of its members think house prices will fall rather than rise in the next three months. This was the first time since 2012 the balance of a monthly RICS survey tipped toward falling prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Uncertainty surrounding the June 23 vote was “by far the most prevalent suggestion" among reasons property brokers cited, said RICS, which trains and accredits real estate surveyors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for U.K. housing also dropped sharply in May, with 33% more RICS members saying enquiries from potential home buyers fell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What we are looking at is a short-term drop caused by the uncertainty resulting from the forthcoming <span class="companylink">EU</span> referendum, coupled by a slowdown following the rush to get into the market ahead of the tax change on the purchase of investment properties," said Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at RICS, which surveyed 326 property brokers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Britons on June 23 will vote whether to leave the <span class="companylink">EU</span>. Polls show the public is split. Uncertainty ahead of the vote has stalled commercial real estate sales, caused volatile trade in sterling, and hampered corporate deal-making.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Proponents of quitting the bloc argue the economy will flourish outside the <span class="companylink">EU</span> and any market jitters will soon pass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other major factor weakening the housing market in May was a change to the so-called stamp duty landlords pay when buying homes, RICS said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This raised the purchase price of rental homes by 3% on April 1, causing a rush to buy before the change came into effect. The U.K. housing market cooled in April for the first time in over a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RICS said the long-term outlook for house prices remains positive due to a shortage of new homes being built. “There is not, at this point, a sense that a fundamental shift is taking place in the market," Mr. Rubinsohn said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.K. house prices have soared in recent years. The average price in March was £292,000, up from a financial-crisis low of £187,000 in March 2009, according to <span class="companylink">Office for National Statistics</span> data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">London has been the center of the housing boom, with the average house price hitting £552,000 in March, ONS data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In central London, where the market is heavily influenced by wealthy international investors, house prices have been falling. The RICS survey showed 35% more property brokers reported lower prices over the past month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The outlook is particularly weak in London," RICS said, noting 43% more brokers expect prices to fall further in the near future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any short-term dip in prices won't necessarily make buying homes more affordable, an issue that has become front-and-center in U.K. politics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is unlikely that we are seeing the emergence of a more affordable market," Mr. Rubinsohn said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On China</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banking</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With its banking system seemingly awash in cash from savings, China may seem an implausible place for a liquidity crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the mix of funding for Chinese banks is changing fast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is becoming less a safe and sound deposits-based financial system and more one funded by potentially flighty sources such as bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking at a set of banks that accounts for almost 87% of banking-sector assets, UBS Securities analyst Jason Bedford estimates deposits as a portion of liabilities have fallen to 72% from 76% in 12 months, a stark change for such a short time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With loan growth exceeding deposit growth, the systemwide loan-to-deposit ratio is heading toward 80%. And that doesn't take into account off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be fair, there is some space before the point at which banking systems become particularly prone to crisis: holding just one yuan in deposits for each yuan lent out. But how long will it take to cross that space?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here is one scenario: If credit across the Chinese economy continues to grow at 15% to 18%, assuming a reasonable amount of capital flight, by Mr. Bedford's estimates that would bump up the loan-to-deposit ratio in the banking system by three to five percentage points a year. At that pace, banks could reach a 95% loan-to-deposit ratio in about three years.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property-Stock Warning</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China has had a real-estate boom lately, but one wouldn't know it by looking at property-developer stocks. That disconnect is a warning to investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices in China are up an average 11% since early 2015. The so-called tier-one cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen have led the gain with a 30% surge in that time. Recently, the rally has spread to the slightly less-big tier-two cities, where prices are up 5% so far this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of home builders, however, haven't showed the same optimism. A benchmark of mainland-listed property stocks has fallen 20% this year, a worse showing than the broader market. In Hong Kong, shares of the biggest Chinese developers have dropped 14%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many Chinese developers are trading below their book values in Hong Kong, where the market is freely accessible to foreign investors. These property companies in general trade at lower valuations than those listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This may mean a massive buying opportunity. But, more plausibly, the stock market is hinting that the current property recovery is unsustainable. The rapid rise in property prices has led to government policies to restrict home buying in some cities. The clampdown likely will expand if housing prices continue to surge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers haven't benefited much from the housing rally anyway. Average net-profit margin for mainland-listed developers fell to 7.9% in the first quarter, from 10% at the end of 2014, despite the higher prices. Part of the reason: Home builders still are sitting on a large stockpile of unsold homes in China's many smaller cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the profit situation may worsen. Land prices, especially in top cities, have risen greatly -- in some cases outpacing average housing prices nearby -- which will squeeze developers' margins further. The housing glut is set to intensify in tier-two cities, where construction starts have picked up sharply. <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> expects new starts to rise 33% in tier-two cities this year, while staying flat for the biggest ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Midsize developer <span class="companylink">Sunac China</span> , for instance, had a gross profit margin of 12% last year, down from 17% in 2014. Last month, it paid a record price for a piece of land in Shanghai. Its shares, traded in Hong Kong, are off 15% this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there is leverage. Total debt issuance by Chinese developers in the first five months of 2016 was three times that of a year earlier, according to Dealogic. Some of the new debt is being used to refinance costlier offshore loans taken out in the previous building cycle a few years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a substantial part is new borrowing. The sector's net debt-to-equity ratio rose to 101% in the first quarter, from 89% by the end of 2014, according to Wind Information.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Net debt at Greenland Holdings, one of China's biggest developers, swelled 16% in just the first quarter, rising to more than four times equity. <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> downgraded the company's rating to junk last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greenland's Shanghai-listed shares have fallen nearly 30% this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices may be rising in China, but property investors would be wise to take the warning from the stock market.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rate Timetable</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Projections aren't promises. All the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> has to do is convince investors that statement is true.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">gave a speech on Monday that, in the wake of Friday's disappointing employment report, provided an upbeat assessment of the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I see good reasons to expect that the positive forces supporting employment growth and higher inflation will continue to outweigh the negative ones," she said, going on to list a number of reasons she thinks that is so, including the low level of weekly jobless claims and the recent step up in consumer spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What she didn't do, however, is give even a hazy indication of when the Fed might again raise rates. This contrasts with last month when she said it would probably be appropriate to raise "in the coming months." And it was in contrast to the minutes of the April Fed meeting, which repeatedly mentioned the possibility of raising rates next week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After veering in the direction of putting policy on a timetable as a way to convince investors of the possibility of a June rate increase, the Fed seems to have a newfound love for not following a set course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the preamble to her speech, Ms. Yellen emphasized that policy is "not on a preset course," going on to point out that "all economic projections are certain to turn out to be inaccurate in some respects, and possibly significantly so."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the idea here may have been to de-emphasize the projections the Fed will release following next week's meeting. These include not just how policy makers see the job market, inflation and economic growth faring, but what they think the trajectory of their target range on overnight interest rates will be. The implication is that investors should look at the projections more as a model of how the Fed thinks about the economy and interest rates than as an indication of where policy is headed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed governor Lael Brainard, who has emerged as an influential voice at the central bank, on Friday provided more detail on why rates shouldn't follow a preset course. One is that given still-heightened global uncertainties, the Fed needs to reassess the outlook each time it raises rates. And it needs investors to understand that. Another is that the neutral funds rates -- where they should be once both inflation and employment are at the Fed's target -- may be quite low. If so, each Fed tightening could pack a much bigger punch than in the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The danger here is that if investors become too complacent about low rates, the Fed might have a hard time shaking them out of it. For now, that seems to be a trade-off the central bank is willing to accept.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OTTAWA--Canadian building permits declined unexpectedly in April, led by lower construction intentions for multifamily dwellings such as condominium units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The total value of building permits issued by Canadian municipalities in April fell 0.3% to 6.89 billion Canadian dollars ($5.44 billion), Statistics Canada said Wednesday. Expectations were for a 1.5% increase, according to economists at <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Canada</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the second consecutive monthly decline in building permits, according to the data agency. The previous month's data were also revised, with permits issued falling 6.3% to C$6.91 billion, versus the earlier estimate of a 7.0% decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits are meant to provide an early indication of construction activity in Canada and are based on a survey of 2,400 municipalities, representing 95% of the country's population. While permits grant firms permission to build, they don't necessarily mean construction will begin immediately.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data also tends to be volatile from one month to the next. On a year-over-year basis, permits issued fell 8.1% in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential permits fell 1.8% to C$4.35 billion in April from the previous month, led by a 6.2% decline in multifamily dwellings. Non-residential permits rose 2.5%, with higher permit demand for universities and government buildings contributing to the advance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The construction sector accounts for roughly 7% of total employment in Canada, while housing-related spending accounts for roughly one-sixth of total economic output.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The southern city of Shenzhen aspires to become China's Silicon Valley. But while it boasts some well-known technology companies, perhaps its strongest resemblance to the U.S. tech hub is something less enviable: sky-high housing prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shenzhen topped Beijing and Shanghai to become China's most expensive housing market in May 2015, according to E-house China R&amp;D Institute, a real-estate research organization. Through April, housing prices in Shenzhen had risen 62% from a year earlier, compared with 28% in Beijing, another tech center, according to Lianjia Real Estate Agency, a top brokerage firm in China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On average, homes in Shenzhen sold at 49,259 yuan per square meter, or roughly $690 a square foot, in April, according to Lianjia. That's nearly as much as the Rockridge neighborhood in Oakland, Calif., a pricey part of the San Francisco Bay Area, where home prices averaged $704 a square foot in April, according to Estately, a Seattle-based homebuying site—even though average income levels in Shenzhen are about one-tenth of those in the Silicon Valley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In China's tech industry, runaway hype can be destructive. With Shenzhen, the rapid rise in housing prices threatens to undermine the very goal that fueled the surge: the dream of transitioning from a manufacturing center to a city with “innovation as its main growth engine," as the Shenzhen government put it in its annual work report this year. The lack of affordable housing is causing talent and companies to leave or consider leaving for more affordable cities. Executives have to scramble to find ways to retain staff and reduce turnover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ren Zhenfei, founder of <span class="companylink">Huawei Technologies</span>, one of the biggest Shenzhen-based companies, recently lamented the effects of the city's housing prices. He warned in an interview last month with the state-run <span class="companylink">Xinhua News Agency</span> that high costs could destroy the city's competitiveness during an age when capital and jobs can move with ease. “People need housing and living facilities," he was quoted as saying. “When living facilities become too expensive, companies can't bear it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shenzhen's prices are soaring for several reasons. It is a small city by area relative to China's biggest metropolises, at about one-eighth the size of Beijing and one-third of Shanghai, so there is limited land to build out. It also is near Hong Kong, among the most expensive housing markets in the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it also is an example of the speculative fever that has driven much of China's property market over the years, especially whenever there is a so-called concept that can justify price increases. The concept of China's Silicon Valley provides a lot of room for imagination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The original Silicon Valley is having its own difficulties[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/in-facebooks-hometown-the-first-responders-arent-local-1458924085] with high property prices. Tech executives in Shenzhen worry that the ill effects in the Chinese city could be more significant because the spike in housing prices is hurting its competitiveness before Shenzhen has had time to develop into a full-fledged tech hub.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Silicon Valley's housing prices are supported by a concentration of top talent and the biggest tech companies in the world, Shenzhen is still on its way, says Bill Liu, who founded flexible-display startup Royole in Silicon Valley and Shenzhen simultaneously in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cities need to have housing prices that are in proportion with salaries, he says. “It will be beneficial to both the city's sustainable growth and companies' global competitiveness."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Wu Kailong, a co-founder of Smartind Technologies, asked some factory owners to use his company's technology for automation and data exchanges, they in turn asked, “Why bother?" Mr. Wu said they told him that they would rather invest in apartments than factory upgrades because if they had sold their factories earlier and invested in real estate, they would have made a lot more money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To cool the market, Shenzhen's government has issued stricter rules for people to qualify as buyers, and housing prices fell 0.4% in April from March, after an 18-month rally. The government also set aside subsidized housing for rent for qualified talents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But people in the tech industry say that the supply is limited and doesn't solve long-term problems. An official with the Shenzhen government's foreign-affairs office referred questions to the city's propaganda office and science and innovation commission, where calls went unanswered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The phenomenon is pushing up costs for startups. Aaron Zhang, founder of drone maker Shenzhen Simtoo Intelligent Technology, provides 500 yuan a month to low-salary employees because rents can take as much as half of their monthly pay, which stands around $1,000. He says even his top engineers, who earn over 300,000 yuan a year—a decent salary in China—joked to him that their annual pay would only buy them a small bathroom in Shenzhen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, Mr. Zhang moved his dozen-member research-and-development team to the central city of Wuhan, where apartments sold for 11,217 yuan per square meter in April, or about one-quarter of Shenzhen's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other startups are providing free dormitories to their staffs—a practice reminiscent of old-line manufacturers that employ troops of low-cost labor. Hardware-designing company Crazybaby rented its first dormitory—a three-bedroom apartment—in May for six female employees and is renting another for male workers. “There's not much privacy, but what can you do?" says Crazybaby's founder, Allen Zhang.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dorm-living didn't work out for programmer Jacob Yan, who resided with three other people in a one-room dormitory when he joined a hardware startup in 2014. Earning 7,700 yuan ($1,170) a month after taxes, he didn't think he would ever be able to afford to buy an apartment in Shenzhen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, he left Shenzhen for the southwestern city of Chongqing after he and his girlfriend decided to get married. They plan to buy an apartment later this year. At 6,950 yuan per square meter, or 14% of the Shenzhen price, homes in Chongqing are much more affordable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Shenzhen felt temporary," says the 29-year-old. “This is a place we can settle down."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto and Chris Kirkham   </div><div>1132 words</div><div>31 May 2016</div><div>19:55</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are back to near-record highs across the U.S. amid rising demand and supply constraints, a sign that the lopsided housing-market recovery of the past five years is gaining some strength.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P/Case-Shiller national home-price index, released Tuesday, has clawed its way back to within 4% of its 2006 peak, a steep rise from the near 30% decline at the bottom in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. new-home sales, meanwhile, in April posted their strongest month in more than eight years, with a nearly 17% jump from a month earlier, the Commerce Department said last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After years of volatility, home prices have grown at a rate around 5% since early 2015. That bodes well for sellers heading into the peak home-selling season in May and June but could pose challenges for buyers, especially first-timers who may be priced out of the market as supply, particularly among starter homes, remains thin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the rise in prices comes amid lingering weakness in some parts of the market. Overall sales volume and new construction remain well below their pre-crisis peaks. And a broader collection of figures point to an uneven recovery that has seen a flourishing market at the high end, mainly in big U.S. cities, while the lower end lags.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's a great market if you have pristine credit and lots of money," said Sean Becketti, chief economist at Freddie Mac. “The people starting out who are looking for that first home—they're having a tougher time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the unbalanced recovery, <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> officials have seen housing as a bright spot for the U.S. economy in recent years. Residential construction has contributed to overall economic output for eight straight quarters, expanding at a 17% annual rate in a first quarter marked by slow growth in other sectors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet while sales are increasing, they have nonetheless been stymied by a lack of new inventory and first-time home buyers. Sales of existing homes, which account for the bulk of the overall market, clocked in at a 5.45 million seasonally adjusted annual rate in April, the second consecutive monthly increase but below the peak seen during the last decade's boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P/Case-Shiller national index rose 5.2% in March. But that is mainly because of a lack of inventory, economists said. When adjusted for inflation the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index remains about 20% below its peak reached in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building activity, meanwhile, remains muted compared with normal markets. April's single-family housing starts were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 778,000 units, down from a more than five-decade average of about 1.03 million, according to Census data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, several markets have surpassed their 2006 price peak, prompting concerns about a bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Dallas, where prices have returned to record levels, first-time buyers have struggled to get into the market. Shriveling inventories of starter homes have driven up prices and led to bidding wars, while wealthier buyers enjoy a better selection of luxury properties to choose from.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has made it difficult for buyers like Jeremy Ponce and his wife, Lyndel, who started looking to purchase a home in Dallas last spring after living in a rental apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They were hoping to find a smaller starter home in the urban center, but quickly realized how competitive the market had become. With inventories at nearly three-decade lows in Dallas, most of the homes in their price range required too many repairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The price they wanted just didn't seem realistic," said the 31-year-old Mr. Ponce, who works as a project manager for a company that builds rail cars. “Some of them were only a little bit bigger than our apartment."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple widened their search away from downtown, but it still took about six months to find what they were looking for: a 3-bedroom, 3½-bath home that was about a five-minute drive from popular entertainment districts. They put in an offer of $417,000, above the asking price of $399,000. Yet Mr. Ponce said they considered themselves lucky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeownership has been declining since the peak of the housing bubble. The national rate slipped in the first quarter to a near four-decade low of 63.5%, according to the Commerce Department. The homeownership rate for households headed by someone under 35 years old fell to 34% in the first quarter of this year, the lowest level since at least 1994.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One main culprit: stricter lending standards since the financial crisis, which have made it tougher for lower earners to qualify for mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, in turn, has prompted builders to focus their efforts on the higher-end segment of the market. New homes under $200,000 made up 19% of U.S. sales last year, down from 38% four years earlier, according to U.S. Census data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An influx of high-earning workers to big U.S. cities is magnifying the imbalances by driving up rents and setting off a scramble among developers to build luxury condominiums and apartment buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index covering the 20 largest U.S. cities rose 5.4% in the 12 months ended in March, outpacing the overall market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the hottest regions in the country, primarily on the West Coast, prices rose at a double-digit pace in March, with Portland, Ore., reporting a 12.3% year-over-year gain, Seattle showing a 10.8% gain and Denver logging a 10% increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Portland has been one of the nation's most robust real estate markets over the last few years as its growing technology sector attracts workers. That has created strong demand for available parcels of land, driving up the individual lot prices—and thus the asking price for a new home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim Chapman, president of Legend Homes, said lenders often are only willing to finance surefire projects at the higher end of the price spectrum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Even if you have a lender who will loan you money to operate with, you have to show that that project is actually going to make a profit," Mr. Chapman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Chapman said he is spending between $250,000 and $350,000 just to acquire and develop the land, before even starting to build the home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You can't build a house that's going to sell for $299,000 to an entry-level market if you spent more than that for the land," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes going under contract to be sold climbed in April to the highest level in more than 10 years, a sign that the housing market is gaining traction amid steady job creation and historically low interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending sales of previously owned homes, reflecting contract signings, rose 5.1% last month from March, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales index climbed to 116.3, the highest level since February 2006. An index of 100 is equal to the average level of contract activity during 2001, which the <span class="companylink">NAR</span> considers a "normal," or balanced, market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"U.S. housing-market activity continues to improve, and all indications thus far point to a strong spring selling season," said Barclays economist Jesse Hurwitz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steady demand for housing has tightened supply and pushed up prices in many markets, especially those where job creation has been robust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that doesn't seem to be deterring buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's figures showed the highest jumps in the West and South, two regions with swiftly appreciating home prices. The Midwest showed a slight slowdown, despite being the most affordable region. That could be a reflection of a slight cooling off as sales of existing homes in the Midwest rose sharply in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists are concerned that scarce inventory could cap further strengthening in the market, and are looking to builders to add more houses. Inventory of new homes for sale sank at the end of April to 4.7 months' supply, its lowest level in more than a year, the Commerce Department reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Housing appears to have had a really good early spring market but this could be due to the fact that the winter was mild and spring set in early," said Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Mizuho Securities USA</span>. "I expect this will prove to be a short-lived development."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending sales in April rose 4.6% compared with a year earlier, marking the 20th consecutive month of year-over-year gains. Pending sales provide a more up-to-date assessment of the housing market than other measures because they are based on contract signings, the earliest stage of the sales process.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Mike Cherney   </div><div>442 words</div><div>26 May 2016</div><div>17:35</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar fell Thursday as investors took profits ahead of key commentary from Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen and new data reflected a mixed outlook on the U.S. economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro gained about 0.35% against the dollar to $1.1195 and the dollar shed about 0.4% against the yen to ¥109.7640. The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the dollar against 16 currencies, was down 0.24% and has been in the red for three of the past four trading days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The selling comes after a rally in the dollar this month, which is up 2.8% in May through Thursday, according to the WSJ Dollar Index. The dollar gained steam as some Fed bank presidents hinted that the central bank could raise rates at its next policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee meeting in June, which at the time was contrary to market expectations. Higher rates are positive for the dollar because it makes the currency more attractive to yield-seeking investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the suggestions that the Fed could raise rates next month, investors will be closely watching comments from Ms. Yellen on Friday when she speaks at <span class="companylink">Harvard University</span> for additional clarity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Without continued strength in U.S. economic data and the endorsement of Fed Chair Janet Yellen, the dollar's recent gains remain fragile," <span class="companylink">Commonwealth Foreign Exchange</span> said in a note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar fell as investors sifted through some mixed economic data on Thursday. Initial jobless claims[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-jobless-claims-fall-for-second-straight-week-1464265989], the number of Americans applying for unemployment checks, which serves as a proxy for layoffs, fell 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 268,000 in the week ended May 21, better than market expectations. Separately, pending home sales [http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/pending-home-sales-climbed-to-highest-level-in-10-years-1464271244]rose 5.1% in April from the previous month and climbed to the highest level in more than 10 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
New orders for durable goods [http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-durable-goods-orders-jumped-3-4-in-april-1464266098]also improved to a seasonally adjusted 3.4% in April from a month earlier. But a large jump in civilian-aircraft orders underpinned the April increase and orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft, which measures business investment, fell 0.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Despite the sharp rise in headline orders, the guts of this report were quite weak, reflecting further softening in business capital investment activity," <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span> said in a note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest-rate futures are pricing in a 26% chance the Fed raises rates at its meeting in June, up from 4% earlier this month but down from 34% the previous day, according to <span class="companylink">CME Group</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A <span class="companylink">Boston Fed</span> paper looks at whether the severe decline in house prices during and after the Great Recession in late 2007 may have hampered adjustment [https://www.bostonfed.org/economic/wp/wp2016/wp1601.pdf?utm_campaign=Hutchins Center&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=29958711&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9Ot0IHaIG29oyWKN-NHJZ8OcZDVgmM2N1HXJSDhOX20lFLALM7i7ccaefYWQXc2rgnsGr1GqQZ21U3uNOq3Dpjb-wQWg&amp;_hsmi=29958711]in U.S. labor markets by limiting the mobility of unemployed workers. The paper, by Yuliya Demyanyk, Dmytro Hryshko, María José Luengo‐Prado and Bent E. Sørensen, finds that individuals with low equity are more likely than other residents in their ZIP code to move to another labor market. But using a model in which the economic benefits of accepting job offers outweigh the costs of moving, they find the sharp decline in house prices in the Great Recession should not limit labor mobility.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spring has sprung for the housing market. Even the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> isn't likely to spoil the fun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steady job growth, rising wages and low interest rates have helped prop up housing demand. Friday's positive report on U.S. existing-home sales underscored this. And even with the specter of another Fed rate increase looming, housing's foundation isn't likely to be shaken.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are a few worries after three consecutive months of declines in new-home sales, but government data and quarterly results from luxury-home builder Toll Brothers Inc., out Tuesday, should ease concerns. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal estimate sales of newly built homes rose 2.3% in April from a month earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, home builders are feeling pretty optimistic about current conditions, which should bode well for Toll. A gauge of home-builder sentiment, released last week, held firmly in positive territory, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>. Perhaps more important, expectations for sales in the next six months jumped to the highest level of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates also remain favorable. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 3.61% in April, the lowest monthly average since May 2013, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. Of course, rates didn't stay low for long back then as the taper tantrum roiled the market. This time, an actual Fed rate increase likely wouldn't provide as much shock value to markets as the mere hint of tapering bond purchases did then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And a factor that has held housing back -- affordability -- might give buyers a breather. On the surface, rising home values have made it more difficult to buy a home, particularly for first-time home buyers. But a measure of housing affordability, compiled by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>, tells a different story.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Realtors</span>' group, assuming a 20% down payment, measures a typical mortgage payment for the median priced home and compares it with median household incomes. By this measure, housing has actually been getting more affordable since the summer. It isn't last call yet for this house party.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of existing homes rose in April for the second straight month, as housing demand firms up alongside steady job growth and historically low interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales rose 1.7% in April from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.45 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest figures confirm "that U.S. housing markets remain healthy," said Barclays economist Jesse Hurwitz. "We expect national construction and sales activity to expand throughout the quarter."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">April's uptick to the highest level since January follows a choppy first quarter that saw sales tumble in February then partially recover in March. Despite healthy job growth, wage increases haven't been keeping pace with home-price appreciation in many desirable markets, stymieing some first-time home buyers and those at the lower end of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But demand continues to grow, especially in more affordable regions like the Midwest. Across the U.S., April's sales were 6% higher than April a year ago. March's sales pace was revised up slightly to 5.36 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, affordability remains a key issue. The national median sale price for a previously owned home last month was $232,500, up 6.3% from a year earlier, marking the 50th straight month of year-over-year gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But where they can, people are buying. In the Midwest, the most affordable region in the country, sales soared 12.1% in April from the prior month. Sales edged up in the Northeast from the prior month, but dropped in the West and South, two regions where home prices have risen fastest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">NAR</span> said there were 2.14 million existing homes available for sale at the end of April, up 9.2% from March. But compared with April a year ago, inventory was down 3.6% from April a year ago. That is a 4.7-month supply at the current sales pace.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just how effective are macroprudential policy tools? A new index from New York Federal Reserve researchers[http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2016/05/international-evidence-on-the-use-and-effectiveness-of-macroprudential-policies.html#.Vz92KvkrJpi] suggests that macroprudential tightening, including caps on loan-to-value ratios for housing loans and caps on debt service-to-income ratios can “significantly reduce credit growth and house price appreciation." The researchers find that “tightenings have been much more common than easings across all groups, with actions more frequent in emerging economies." Had macroprudential measures never been enacted, the growth rate for housing prices and bank credit would have been “significantly higher" over 2011-13, the period measured by the researchers. They conclude that the results “provide new evidence in support of adopting macroprudential policies to attenuate credit and house price cycles," but caution that their research does not demonstrate that the tools can “fully eliminate booms."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kristina Peterson   </div><div>578 words</div><div>19 May 2016</div><div>14:13</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—An angry fight erupted on the House floor Thursday when an antidiscrimination measure failed by a single vote after some Republican lawmakers changed their positions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Democrats chanted “shame" when last-minute GOP opposition sank an amendment from Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D., N.Y.) that appeared moments earlier to have the votes to pass. The amendment to the military construction spending bill would have prevented taxpayer funds from going to government contractors who refused to comply with an executive order[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/obama-to-bar-gay-discrimination-by-federal-contractors-1402934436] barring them from hiring or firing employees based on sexual orientation or gender identity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The measure was blocked in a 212-213 vote, with all 213 no votes coming from Republicans. Yes votes came from 183 Democrats and 29 Republicans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Infuriated Democrats said GOP leaders had changed normal House floor procedures Thursday to enable those switching their votes to do so quietly from the electronic voting machines in various spots on the House floor, rather than coming down to the well, where it would be obvious who was changing their position.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They didn't want their members who were flip-flopping to have to go down to the well and take that walk of shame," said Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D., Ill.).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GOP aides said all normal House floor procedures were followed. Some Republicans changed their votes because if the Maloney amendment had been approved, that could have derailed the entire military construction spending bill, aides said. The broader spending bill later passed in a 295-129 vote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rep. John Fleming (R., La.) said he opposed the amendment on Thursday because “it takes away the protections of religious liberty."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's floor fight followed a contentious vote Wednesday night on the annual defense policy bill, which included a provision that the White House and many rights groups believe will allow government contractors to disregard federal guidelines against gender and sexual-preference discrimination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In the past day, House Republicans have gone out of their way to rig votes and block bills that prevent discrimination against LGBT people," Mr. Maloney said in a statement after Thursday's vote. “When they break their our own rules to make sure taxpayer dollars can go to folks who discriminate, they showed who they truly are—bigots and cowards."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The House fracas came at a time when the country is wrestling with issues of gender identity and sexual orientation. A group of 78 House Republicans so far have signed a letter asking the Justice and Education departments to clarify last week's guidance on transgender students' bathroom use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last Friday, the Obama administration told educators around the country they should allow transgender students to use the bathroom[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/obama-administration-directs-public-schools-on-transgender-bathroom-rights-1463112023] and locker facilities of their chosen gender, saying federal law bars discrimination against such students. The Justice Department and the state of North Carolina sued each other[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/justice-department-sues-north-carolina-saying-bathroom-law-violates-civil-rights-1462823205] last week over a new law in that state requiring people to use public bathrooms according to the sex on their birth certificates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) told reporters Thursday the issue should be left to the states to decide. He gave a similar response when asked his stance on the Maloney amendment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The states should do it. The federal government shouldn't stick its nose in this business," he said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Ben Leubsdorf   </div><div>789 words</div><div>18 May 2016</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2016, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. economy is stabilizing after another rough winter, shrugging off worries about a recession or prolonged slowdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economic gauges released Tuesday showed a pickup in industrial output, continued momentum in the housing sector and firming inflation all pointing to stronger -- though still unspectacular -- growth in the second quarter. That joined other recent data showing a rebound in retail sales, rising consumer confidence and continued job gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've gotten confirmation that the fears of recession or deflation . . . that we saw earlier this year have been dispelled," said economist Diane Swonk, founder of consultancy DS Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> officials, wary of volatility in financial markets and weakness overseas, have held short-term interest rates steady this year after raising them in December from near zero. A second-quarter rebound for domestic growth and rising inflation, if sustained, could help push officials to raise rates in the coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of goods and services produced across the U.S. economy, expanded at a 0.5% annual rate in the first three months of 2016. But growth appears poised to accelerate. Forecasting firm <span class="companylink">Macroeconomic Advisers</span> on Tuesday estimated GDP would expand at a 2.3% pace in the current quarter. The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta</span> put its estimate for second-quarter growth at 2.5% after Tuesday's data. Ms. Swonk said she expected 2.5% growth, calling it "nothing to write home about, but a nice snapback."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the recession ended, first-quarter GDP growth has frequently come in weak, followed by a stronger second quarter. This year may have been no exception, and Tuesday's reports reinforced the picture of resumed modest growth in the overall economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed said industrial production -- a measure of everything made by factories, utilities and mines -- surged 0.7% in April, the biggest jump for a single month since November 2014. Utilities drove the increase, boosting output by nearly 6% to respond to higher demand for electricity and natural gas. The Fed attributed the jump to a return to normal weather in April after a warmer-than-usual March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Factory output grew 0.3% in April after falling by the same pace in March. Demand for big-ticket items like machinery and cars picked up last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturing production as measured by the Fed has been flat since January, a sign that the factory sector remains weakened after more than a year of pressure from falling oil prices and a strong dollar. But the situation is no longer deteriorating. A closely watched gauge of industrial sentiment, published by the <span class="companylink">Institute for Supply Management</span>, signaled expansion the past two months for the first time since last summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing recovery has been a steady contributor to broader economic growth over the past two years. In the first quarter, residential investment added 0.49 percentage point to the quarter's 0.5% growth rate for GDP, according to Commerce Department data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home building has appeared to remain on track into the spring. Housing starts rose 6.6% in April from a month earlier, the agency said Tuesday, and building permits climbed 3.6% from March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long-sluggish U.S. inflation appears to be firming as the labor market tightens, oil prices rise and the dollar weakens. The consumer-price index, which measures what Americans pay for everything from fresh fruit to footwear, increased a seasonally adjusted 0.4% in April from the prior month after rising 0.1% in March, the Labor Department said Tuesday. That was the largest one-month increase since February 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising prices at the pump drove last month's jump, with gasoline prices up a seasonally adjusted 8.1% from March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A measure of underlying price pressures, which excludes the often-volatile categories of food and energy, rose 0.2% last month after ticking up 0.1% in March, the Labor Department said. Core prices were up 2.1% from a year earlier, a fifth consecutive month of annual growth above 2% -- the longest such streak in four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inflation has undershot the Fed's 2% annual target since 2012. The central bank prefers to use an alternative measure, the Commerce Department's personal consumption expenditures price index, which rose 0.8% in March from a year earlier and climbed 1.6% excluding food and energy prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We view this rise in inflation as consistent with our view that reduced slack in the U.S. economy will continue to put upward pressure on prices," said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suggests Growth</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A gauge of home-builder sentiment was unchanged in May, a sign of steady growth for the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> housing-market index held at 58 this month, the trade group said Monday. A reading over 50 means most builders generally see conditions in the single-family housing market as positive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising employment and low mortgage rates have helped fuel demand. That boosted expectations for sales in the next six months to the highest level of the year.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Chris Kirkham   </div><div>978 words</div><div>7 May 2016</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2016, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Paradise at Ironwood Crossing, a 2,100-home master-planned community southeast of Phoenix, new houses starting as low as $170,000 are snapped up within weeks of hitting the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The starter homes in this suburban enclave are among the most affordable in the metro area, said Dennis Webb, vice president of operations at builder <span class="companylink">Fulton Homes</span>, and are among the company's top sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But escalating land prices and local development fees mean that continuing to build new homes in that price range is no longer viable, Mr. Webb said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's not enough profit to be made on that entry-level house," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the U.S., new-home construction has remained at historical lows throughout the housing recovery of the last five years, but the share of starter homes priced below $200,000 has dwindled more than any other segment, according to U.S. Census data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New homes under $200,000 made up 19% of U.S. sales last year, down from 38% four years earlier. By contrast, homes sold between $300,000 and $500,000 accounted for 34% of new home sales last year, up from 22% in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shift reflects drastic changes in the business of home building and the profile of buyers since the housing bust, developers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many builders ventured to the far fringes of the suburbs in the mid-2000s in search of cheap land for a seemingly endless pool of buyers. When the housing market tanked the value of that land plummeted as demand dried up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, tightened lending standards in recent years have had the biggest impact on first-time buyers, effectively leaving them on the sidelines. That prompted builders to cater to demand from buyers who could afford larger, pricier homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many surveys show millennials still eventually aspire to homeownership in the suburbs, but they are waiting until later in life to purchase homes than prior generations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although many major builders, particularly <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton Inc</span>., have once again started marketing to first-time home buyers over the last two years, that share of overall home buyers remains at a nearly three-decade low of 32%, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The move-up market has been much more profitable per house than the entry level," said housing economist Brad Hunter, chief economist at HomeAdvisor, an online home services marketplace. "Builders decided 'Well, let me deploy my resources where I can get the best return.'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding to the complication: Land prices have shot up as the economic recovery has progressed, further driving up the minimum price points for new homes as builders compete for prime lots that are closer to job centers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although land remains the least expensive on the periphery of major metro areas, many builders have been hesitant to pursue projects in those areas, mindful of how that backfired a decade ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the U.S., prices for finished lots are nearly back to the peak levels of 2006, according to the most recent figures from John Burns Real Estate Consulting of Irvine, Calif. Values for finished lots have increased 59% since the market bottomed in 2009, according to an index of lot prices throughout the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In popular suburbs of Dallas, such as Frisco, Texas, prices for lots have increased from $50,000 to as much as $120,000 over the same period, according to builders and developers in the area. In markets such as Dallas, Austin and Denver, lot prices have surpassed previous peaks. Even hard-hit markets like Phoenix are nearly back to boom prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some major publicly traded builders such as <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>., <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span> and <span class="companylink">Standard Pacific Corp</span>. (now <span class="companylink">CalAtlantic Group Inc</span>.) snapped up cheap land when prices hit bottom in 2009 and 2010. But many other builders started acquiring land only as the recovery picked up in 2013, when lots were more expensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you were buying land at significantly higher prices, you immediately prevented yourself from building a lower-priced product on that land," said Rick Palacios Jr., director of research at John Burns Real Estate Consulting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The land at Paradise at Ironwood Crossing outside Phoenix, for example, was purchased by <span class="companylink">Fulton Homes</span> a decade ago at a lower price point. That allowed for more flexibility in the asking prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marianne Lubich said she was thrilled to find the home she moved into last September with her son, less than a half-hour from work and just 10 minutes away from a major shopping area. She had looked closer to her office in Chandler, Ariz., but a new home would have cost too much -- even existing homes were pricey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm like 'Geez, I can get a brand new home for this price?" said Ms. Lubich, whose home's final price tag came to about $212,000, with several upgrades. "I got a lot for my money."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Donnie Evans, president of Altura Homes in the Dallas area, said increased land and permitting costs in many Dallas suburbs have taken a chunk of prospective buyers out of the market over the last two years. Homes at the lowest end that his company used to sell for $120,000 two years ago are now going for $190,000, and so on up the chain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Having a first-time home buyer market is very, very important," said Pat Hamill, chief executive of Oakwood Homes in the Denver area, because it allows buyers to progress upward through the system, building equity along the way that can be used to purchase a larger or more desirable home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't know what happens when you take that segment out of the marketplace."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos   </div><div>332 words</div><div>6 May 2016</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2016, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sluggish entry-level construction is putting a squeeze on families that would like to buy their first home. A new report blames City Hall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The culprit: "Impact fees" that builders have to pay municipalities when they get permits for new construction, says the report from <span class="companylink">Zelman &amp; Associates</span>, a housing-research firm. These fees fund the local infrastructure needed to support a growing population -- schools, transportation, environmental mitigation and utilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cities boosted these impact fees after the downturn -- even though builders were cutting prices -- to make up for lost revenue. During and before the housing boom, these fees had supported municipal budgets, together with property taxes, which stopped rising when home prices fell. The upshot is that housing supply -- and not demand -- could be more to blame for sluggish sales gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders have faced other cost constraints besides permitting fees in recent years, including rising costs of labor, land and supplies. But for entry-level construction, "this is the No. 1 impediment right now," said Ivy Zelman, the research firm's chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a bigger issue at the entry level because builders face tighter margins to begin with. It is easier for them to pass along these fees on luxury homes that have fatter margins because the fees represent a smaller share of the sales price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Zelman's firm surveyed hundreds of builders across 37 metro areas and found that the average impact fee is up 45% since 2005, to around $21,000. They range from as low as $2,600 in Houston to $72,000 in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For entry-level buyers, financing is also an issue. Many builders rely on loans backed by the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span>, which allows buyers to make down payments of just 3%. Ms. Zelman says as fees rise, builders are struggling to build homes that they can sell for prices below <span class="companylink">FHA</span> limits.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Chris Kirkham   </div><div>918 words</div><div>3 May 2016</div><div>22:24</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the home-building business, land purchases are every bit as important as the concrete, wood and insulation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buy land at a low price in a good location and you can generate significant profits from home sales on those lots. Buy the wrong land at the wrong time and you can be saddled with expenses years down the line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a battle between the founder[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/visions-clash-over-pultegroups-future-1460334303#:Gbbe4wryfgVXGA] of home builder PulteGroup Inc. and its chief executive shifts to its annual shareholders' meeting Wednesday, the land game has emerged as a major flashpoint in the debate over the company's future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“<span class="companylink">PulteGroup</span>'s land position is deep, but CEO [Richard] Dugas has not been able to figure out how to utilize this asset," said William J. “Bill" Pulte, the company's founder and largest shareholder, in a recent letter that took aim at board members who support Mr. Dugas, the current chief executive and chairman. “The ability to deliver more homes on existing owned lots is untapped potential with the right leader at <span class="companylink">PulteGroup</span>."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">PulteGroup</span> management has dismissed that assessment, arguing the company will significantly boost the number of home sales this year, making its pipeline of land “comparable to the rest of the industry."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past month, Mr. Pulte has launched an offensive[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/pultegroup-ceo-to-retire-next-year-amid-accelerated-succession-plan-1459769100#:S0QJO-HP_EVXGA] against Mr. Dugas, a onetime protégé whom Mr. Pulte handpicked to become chief executive in 2003. Amid pressure from Mr. Pulte, Mr. Dugas last month announced he would be retiring next year. Mr. Dugas declined to comment on Mr. Pulte's assertions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Pulte has continued to demand Mr. Dugas's immediate resignation, arguing to board members and shareholders that <span class="companylink">PulteGroup</span>'s stock performance has lagged behind rival home builders throughout the housing recovery. He vowed to vote[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/pultegroup-founder-escalates-push-against-home-builders-chief-executive-1461193556#:ifI6bM6ZZUVXGA] against every board member at this week's shareholders' meeting if they didn't replace Mr. Dugas and the lead director, James Postl.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the rhetoric, analysts don't expect much to change after Wednesday's annual meeting. The skirmish has been public for only a month, leaving little time for Mr. Pulte to galvanize investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pulte is the largest shareholder, but with 8.9% of outstanding shares he has far from a controlling interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pulte has pointed to the company's stock price since the beginning of 2014, which has fallen by 5% as competitors <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>. have gained 43% and 17%, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A key reason for that underperformance, Mr. Pulte said, is slow growth in home closings. <span class="companylink">PulteGroup</span>'s closings have declined by about 3% since 2013, while <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span> has boosted closings by 52% and <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> by 33% over the same period, according to the most recent annual data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pulte has argued the company isn't taking advantage of the lots it already has on its books, and is continuing to spend money acquiring new land at a time when lots are expensive. He said the company's land is “sitting there like dead wood." Mr. Dugas declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement, the company said it is focused on driving “more profitable growth and higher returns rather than just delivering growth for growth's sake." <span class="companylink">PulteGroup</span> cited recording a 40% compounded annual growth rate in pretax profit between 2011 and 2015 on only 3% compounded annual growth in home deliveries over the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The skirmish dates back to the last recession. In 2009 <span class="companylink">PulteGroup</span> announced a merger with Dallas home builder Centex, which specialized in entry-level homes at lower price points. For marketing the deal to investors, one of the key selling points was the enormous inventory of lots the combined company would be able to harvest once housing demand picked up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By May 2010, <span class="companylink">PulteGroup</span> was projecting a return to profitability for the year. Instead, by the end of 2010 the company had to record write-downs on the <span class="companylink">Centex</span> deal totaling more than $1.2 billion—a sum that nearly matched what <span class="companylink">PulteGroup</span> had paid up front in stock. The company declined to comment on the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a large supply of lots already on hand, the company remained on the sidelines as the real-estate market bottomed in 2011. Other builders, particularly <span class="companylink">Lennar</span>, bought attractive lots at bargain prices between 2010 and 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2012 and 2013, <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> and <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span> were spending more than 30% of revenue on land, according to data compiled by Barclays analyst Stephen Kim, in a sign of investment in growth. <span class="companylink">PulteGroup</span>, by contrast, was spending about 20%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, as land prices have risen, competitors have decreased land spending, while <span class="companylink">PulteGroup</span> has increased its spending to 40% of revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They're continuing to spend on land at a very elevated rate, even though they acknowledge they already have a lot of land," said Mr. Kim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past five years, Mr. Dugas has outlined a strategy that focuses less on the volume of home sales and more on profitability. Analysts said the company might simply be playing the hand it has been dealt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They were late to the game in terms of buying land, because of the <span class="companylink">Centex</span> deal they had to digest," said Susan Maklari, an analyst with <span class="companylink">UBS</span>. “But now's not the time to go out and start chasing growth."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PRINCE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late Musician Left No Will, Sister Says</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The singer Prince died without a will, his younger sister said in a court filing, further muddying the fate of his vast musical catalog, particularly the trove of unreleased songs known as “the vault."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calling the situation “an emergency," Tyka Nelson asked a Carver County, Minn., probate court to grant temporary oversight of her brother's affairs to St. Paul-based <span class="companylink">Bremer Bank</span>, which she said had worked closely with him “for a number of years." In an email, a Bremer spokeswoman wrote: “It is our policy not to reveal the names of our customers or information related to requests for services."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prince's death remains under investigation since he was found unresponsive last Thursday at the suburban Minneapolis compound where he lived and recorded. He was 57 years old. In the days since Prince's death, his music began selling briskly and reappearing on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>, where it had long been elusive—thanks to the singer's famously aggressive approach to protecting his music from being used in unauthorized ways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deciding whether to maintain or alter Prince's stance on such matters is just one of many challenges that will face whoever ends up in control of his empire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Nelson's filing described herself as the singer's only full sibling but also listed six half-siblings, five of them still living, whom she called “interested persons" in the late singer's affairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, signs on the door to Ms. Nelson's home in Minneapolis read “No trespassing" and “Keep out." None of the half-siblings could be reached.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the absence of living parents, grandparents or children, under Minnesota law, Prince's estate would go to his siblings if he indeed didn't leave a will. Full or half siblings would receive equal shares.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes that went under contract in March reached the highest level in nearly a year, a sign the housing market is gaining steam as Americans benefit from low interest rates and steady job growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending sales of previously owned homes, reflecting contract signings, rose 1.4% last month from February, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales index climbed to 110.5, the highest level since last May. An index of 100 is equal to the average level of contract activity during 2001, which the <span class="companylink">NAR</span> considers a “normal" or balanced, market for the current U.S. population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected pending home sales to rise 0.5% in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending sales provide a more up-to-date checkup of the housing market than other measures because they are based on contract signings, the earliest stage of the sales process. It can take weeks and even months for sales to become final. Some contracts are later canceled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending sales in March climbed 1.4% compared with a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Despite supply deficiencies in plenty of areas, contract activity was fairly strong in a majority of markets in March," Lawrence Yun, the NAR's chief economist, said in a statement.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">College Readiness Shows a Decline</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only 37% of American 12th-graders were academically prepared for college math and reading in 2015, a slight dip from two years earlier, according to test scores released Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Assessment of Educational Progress, also known as the “Nation's Report Card," said that share was down from an estimated 39% in math and 38% in reading in 2013, the last time the test was administered.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">America's housing market is in good shape and the country's biggest banks are taking advantage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest sign of strength came Tuesday from the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index showing that prices across the country rose 5.3% in the year to February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier, data from the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> showed existing-home sales rising 5.1% in March after a decline in February that had some observers worried.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response, banks not only are making more mortgage loans but also are choosing to keep more of them on their books rather than selling them off to government-backed guarantors <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. Very often these are so-called jumbo mortgages that exceed Fannie's and Freddie's size limits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The share of outstanding mortgage debt held by U.S. banks rose to 31.7% in October of 2015, the most recent figure available, according to data from the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>. That is up from 30.9% a year earlier and the highest proportion since the depths of the financial crisis in April of 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Figures from the biggest banks suggest that this trend continued in 2016. In the first quarter, mortgage loans held by the top four lenders -- <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span>, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> and <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> -- were up 28% from a year earlier. That excludes mortgages being run off at Citi Holdings, <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>'s pool of bad assets left over from the crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sharp rise during the first quarter was powered by a 37% increase at <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span>, which has been particularly aggressive in making and retaining jumbo mortgages, says Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This strategy makes sense. The major banks are flush with deposits and looking for places to put money to work. They could buy mortgage-backed securities, but why not just hold their own mortgages? Additionally, unlike individual loans, mortgage-backed securities held as available for sale have to be marked down when interest rates rise, Mr. Goldberg notes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, gradually rising rates will be welcome news for these newly enthusiastic mortgage lenders, so long as the pace of rate increases is sufficiently gradual to prevent a sharp drop-off in home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, for most ordinary mortgages, Fannie and Freddie still dominate. But America's biggest banks are very happy to take the cream off the top of the market. Their investors should be pleased as well.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices rose again in February, the latest sign of limited supplies and steady demand across the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index covering the entire nation rose 5.3% in the 12 months ended in February, unchanged from the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-city index gained 4.6% from a year earlier, compared with 5.0% a month earlier, and the 20-city index gained 5.4% year-over-year, down from 5.7% in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected a 5.7% increase in the 20-city index in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hottest markets in the country, largely on the West Coast, continued to show hefty price gains, led by Portland, Ore.'s 11.9% year-over-year price increase, Seattle's 11.0%, and Denver's 9.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the prior month, the seasonally adjusted U.S. index posted a 0.4% month-over-month increase in February, the 10-city index gained 0.6% and the 20-city index rose 0.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before seasonal adjustment, the national index advanced 0.2% month-over-month in February, the 10-city was up 0.1% and the 20-city climbed 0.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While prices are still growing at a relatively fast pace, there are signs they are moderating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That could be good news for a market constrained by tight inventories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Homeowners looking to sell their house and trade up to a larger house or a more desirable location are concerned with finding that new house," said David Blitzer, managing director at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. “Additionally, the pace of new single family home construction and sales has not completely recovered from the recession."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Chris Kirkham   </div><div>814 words</div><div>23 April 2016</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2016, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Connie Durnal has more than two decades of experience as a broker in the Dallas real-estate market. But these days she thinks of her career in two distinct phases: the last two years and "the olden days."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in the Dallas metro area, historically one of the nation's most stable and affordable markets, have climbed at one of the fastest rates in the U.S. since 2014. Inventories of houses on the market are under two months' supply, the lowest in 25 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the popular north Dallas suburbs, home to major corporate moves for <span class="companylink">Liberty Mutual Insurance</span> and <span class="companylink">Toyota Motor Corp</span>., Ms. Durnal said homes priced at market value usually fetch multiple offers in less than a day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The demand is staggering," said Ms. Durnal, an agent with real-estate brokerage firm Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The escalating prices and tightening availability of homes in Dallas point to the challenges facing many of the nation's largest real-estate markets as the crucial spring selling season heats up. Home sales volumes typically increase in February and continue through June, as the weather improves and families look to get settled in school districts for the fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With mortgage rates at historic lows, unemployment at its lowest in eight years and housing inventories shriveling, particularly on the lower end of the spectrum, U.S. housing markets are becoming less affordable compared with historical norms. That puts the most pressure on first-time home buyers, who accounted for less than one-third of home purchases last year, the lowest level in nearly three decades, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nina Sastrodihardjo had been looking for a home in Plano, Texas, just north of Dallas, for more than two months last fall with no success, getting outbid at every attempt as pressure has been intensified by an influx of population and high-paying jobs from places such as California. In November she saw a home she liked that had gone up for sale on a Monday night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When she went to check it out on Wednesday, there were cars lined up and down the street. She tried a more aggressive strategy that worked: She made an offer $6,000 over the asking price of $285,000, but with the caveat that it would expire in 24 hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I knew things were competitive, but I didn't expect it to be this competitive," said Ms. Sastrodihardjo, a procurement manager for Hewlett-Packard, who got the house for $285,000. "You have to tackle it like a project manager."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three-quarters of real-estate markets in U.S. counties larger than 100,000 people are less affordable now than a year ago, according to a recent analysis from data company RealtyTrac. Home prices have outpaced wage growth in 94% of those counties since home prices hit bottom in each of the locations, the analysis found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of 132 markets tracked by John Burns Real Estate Consulting of Irvine, Calif., 27 are less affordable than historical averages, up from 16 last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Inventory is very restricted, which is creating bidding wars and pushing up prices," said Daren Blomquist, a senior vice president at RealtyTrac. "That makes it a very tough environment for many buyers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Liberty Mutual</span> last year announced plans for a major expansion at a massive new campus in Plano, beginning in 2017 and continuing through 2018. That came on the heels of <span class="companylink">State Farm Insurance</span> in 2013 announcing a major expansion of its regional offices in Richardson, another northern Dallas suburb. By next year, Toyota will finish moving its North American headquarters to Plano from Southern California, adding as many as 4,000 new jobs to the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in Dallas rose 9.2% in January year-to-year, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index, the fifth-fastest among 20 major metropolitan markets. January marked 13 months of consecutive year-to-year price gains above 8% in Dallas, far above the national average of about 4.7% over the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many other big U.S. cities are feeling the squeeze. Jane McPherson and her husband started looking for a larger home in the Denver area last year after they and their two children outgrew the three-bedroom, one-bathroom home they bought 15 years ago. But most of the houses they liked required tripling or quadrupling the expenditure -- something she and her husband weren't ready to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We could sell our house in a red-hot second, but we'd have absolutely nowhere to go," she said. So they are staying put, instead adding a two-story addition to the back of the house.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anya Martin   </div><div>817 words</div><div>22 April 2016</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2016, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With high home prices, low inventory and heated bidding wars, Seattle is the new San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the metro Seattle area, home-sale prices rose 9.5% from 2014 to 2015, putting the median home value at $385,300, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. That's below the limit for government-backed loans for the area, which currently is $540,500. But Seattle buyers who want a dream home in a desirable neighborhood will probably need a jumbo mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seattle still lags behind San Francisco, where the median home value is $781,600, but buyers in both cities -- many in the tech industry -- are competing for a limited pool of properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John O'Brien, age 37, and wife Emily, 34, and two children, ages 2 and 4, moved to Seattle from San Francisco in July and rent a four-bedroom house for $4,300 a month. They have since had another baby and are feeling the squeeze.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before house-hunting, they submitted income and credit documentation to a lender to find out how much they could afford, says Mr. O'Brien, vice president of media strategy for the OutCast Agency, a communications and marketing firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Preapproved for a mortgage, the O'Briens thought they were ready to buy in the spring -- until they found that their targeted Magnolia neighborhood had only a few listings and prices were rising fast, Mr. O'Brien says. Two months yielded only two homes that met their three-bedroom minimum requirement within their budget. One of the homes needed extensive repairs, so they decided not to bid, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're concerned if we wait too long, everything will be unaffordable," Mr. O'Brien says. "No matter what we end up buying, we're not going to be 100% thrilled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Seattle has one of the strongest home markets . . . with several consecutive years of solid price appreciation," says Lawrence Yun, chief economist for NAR. "Not only technology workers but also companies are moving to Seattle." (<span class="companylink">News Corp</span>, which owns The Wall Street Journal, also owns Realtor.com, the listing website of the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the prerecession Seattle market, homes would sell within four to six months, says Patti Hill, a broker with Seattle-based <span class="companylink">Windermere Real Estate</span>. Now, anything that comes on the market is likely to be gone within one month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One home she sold recently had 13 offers, she says. And while offers 10% over asking price are typical even for older homes with some issues, she saw one house sell for 30% over asking. "I have had buyers who have put in 10 offers," she adds. "You get very fatigued."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Francisco-based lender SoFi says Seattle is its second-largest market for jumbo mortgages behind San Francisco, with a median loan amount of $798,000. "The median loan amount in San Francisco is about the same, but Seattle buyers get more on a square-foot basis," says Michael Tannenbaum, vice president of mortgage at SoFi. "Also, the housing stock is very different, with more single-family homes and newer condos" in Seattle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> saw an approximately 20% increase in its jumbo lending volume in Seattle from 2014 to 2015, says Dave Gorman, regional sales executive. He says technology jobs are the biggest relocation driver, with mortgage borrowers coming from across the country, as well as international buyers with work visas, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More considerations for Seattle home buyers:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- More money down. Accelerating home prices are creating more appraisal challenges in the Seattle area, where about 15% of SoFi's recent loans appraised lower than the sale price due to lack of availability of comparable recent sales, Mr. Tannenbaum says. If a home appraises lower than the asking price, the borrower may need to come up with a higher down payment, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Get a "pre-inspection." Because of the fiercely competitive market, sellers expect buyers to bid quickly and waive the home-inspection contingency. Before making a bid, house-hunters are commonly paying for a pre-inspection, Ms. Hill says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A basic pre-inspection covers major systems, such as plumbing, wiring and the foundation, and costs about $250. A full inspection is more thorough and costs about $500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Creative bargaining. Some determined buyers will employ aggressive tactics to get a seller to pick them, Ms. Hill says. She has seen bidders win out by upping the nonrefundable earnest money (usually 1% to 2% of sales price) to as much as $50,000 to $100,000 on a $500,000 to $800,000 home. One buyer paid an additional $20,000 to walk away from an accepted offer, she adds.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Life Expectancy Falls</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For White Americans</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Life expectancy fell for the U.S. white population in 2014 and remained flat for all population groups combined, according to data released Wednesday by the <span class="companylink">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</span>, showing how increases in death rates from suicides, drug overdoses and related causes are threatening an important measure of health and prosperity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of years a white American born in 2014 could be expected to live fell to 78.8 years from 78.9 years the year before, according to the CDC. The change was driven largely by women.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Non-Hispanic white women live longer than men and African-Americans of both genders in the U.S., with a life expectancy at birth of 81.1 years in 2014, according to the CDC. That is a slight decline from 2013, when it was 81.2 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Basically, we're back to where it was in 2009," said Elizabeth Arias, the author of the report,in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Life expectancy for non-Hispanic white men, at 76.5 years, also fell last year, but by a small amount that isn't visible because of rounding, Dr. Arias said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such reversals, even small ones, are unusual for wealthy nations, where people tend to live longer with each successive generation as health care and public safety improve and the standard of living rises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there were improvements for some groups: African-American men gained 0.4 year of life expectancy in 2014, to 72.2 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deaths from suicides, drug overdoses and similar causes appear to be playing a bigger role. Research published in November showed that white middle-aged Americans -- both men and women -- have been dying at a rising rate since the beginning of this century, in large part because of suicides, alcohol abuse and chronic liver diseases.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-Home Sales</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rose 5.1% in March</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes rose in March, a sign of recovery in the market after a rocky start to the year, although inventory remained tight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales rose 5.1% in March from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.33 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">February's sales pace was revised down slightly to 5.07 million. March's sales were 1.5% higher than a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The "underlying reality remains the same: Housing demand is solid and steady, but there aren't enough houses on the market to keep up," said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said there were 1.98 million existing homes available for sale at the end of March, down 1.5% from a year earlier and a 4.5-month supply at the current sales pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, the association's chief economist, described demand as sturdy but said buyers at the low end of the market face limited inventory, while the stock market's rough start to the year may have discouraged high-end home sales during the "bouncy" first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The choppiness in sales activity so far this year is directly related to the unevenness in the rate of new listings coming onto the market to replace what is, for the most part, being sold rather quickly," Mr. Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tight supply prompted potential buyers to snap up homes more rapidly as they came on the market. Homes stayed on the market for an average of 47 days in March, down from 59 days in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Limited supply has also had an impact on prices: The national median sale price for a previously owned home last month was $222,700, up 5.7% from a year earlier, marking the 49th straight month of year-over-year gains.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home Building Slowed in March</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of home building fell in March to its lowest level since October, another sign momentum in the housing market is slowing after a strong 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The monthly fallback retraces some of February's gains, leaving the overall trend for the first quarter largely flat compared with the previous year's pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts fell 8.8% from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.089 million in March, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the slowdown was concentrated in the Midwest, while groundbreaking picked up in the Northeast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starts on single-family homes, which account for roughly two-thirds of the market, fell 9.2% in March.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MELBOURNE, Australia—Australia's biggest banks are toughening lending criteria for home loans to foreigners[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/australian-crackdown-on-foreign-property-buyers-intensifies-1442376372].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd</span>., the country's biggest bank by market value and the largest mortgage-lender, as of Monday tightened requirements for some foreigners with applications involving self-employment and temporary visas. That echoed a move last month by <span class="companylink">Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group Ltd</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Australian lenders—who have enjoyed years of relatively low levels of bad debts—are losing their appetite for risk as the country's red-hot housing market shows signs of slowing and stresses mount for resources companies amid a slump in commodity prices. Authorities last year also pushed banks to tighten lending standards as they worried that speculative home-loans were fueling house prices and that banks would loosen lending standards as they scrambled for market share amid a record low central-bank cash rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign investment into Australian real estate has been booming, accounting for about 50% of the value of all investment approvals granted by the country in the last financial year. A large proportion of the property investments involved Chinese investors[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/chinese-investment-in-australian-real-estate-doubles-1460265591], government data showed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonresident Chinese own a small portion of Australia's housing stock but the central bank recently said they account for a significant and increasing share of purchases, particularly apartments in Sydney and Melbourne. In its latest assessment of the financial system, released last week, the <span class="companylink">Reserve Bank of Australia</span> warned that if a significant subset of property buyers, such as increasingly important Chinese buyers, reduced demand sharply it would weigh on housing prices. Such a reduction in housing demand could come from a sharp economic slowdown in China or a further tightening of capital controls by Chinese authorities, it said</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the central bank said the Australian banking system has little direct exposure to Chinese investors. While Australian-owned banks engage in some lending to foreign households to purchase Australian property, the amounts are small relative to their mortgage books, it said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The changes introduced by <span class="companylink">Commonwealth Bank</span> include no longer allowing foreign currency income as an eligible source of income in home-loan application, as well as lowering the maximum ratio for loans to 70% of the value of the property from 80% previously for certain foreign residents living and working in Australia and being paid in Australian dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We constantly review and monitor our home-loan portfolio to ensure we are maintaining our prudent lending standards and meeting our customers' financial needs," a spokesman for the bank said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like other banks in Australia, <span class="companylink">Commonwealth Bank</span> last year lifted mortgage rates on home loans to investors in response to a call by the industry regulator to curb lending to local property speculators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, mortgage brokers received a letter from ANZ saying it was changing foreign-income thresholds and increasing the documents required to include all visa information, employment contracts and three months of pay slips. The note said it also would no longer accept applications from borrowers that only have income from overseas, and would fix the maximum loan-to-value ratio at 70% for applicants with foreign income of more than 50% of their total.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokeswoman for National Australia Bank Ltd. said the lender on April 9 tightened its loan limit for foreign applicants to 70% of home values from 80%, and that settings were continually reviewed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March 2015, the former federal treasurer ordered the sale of a 39 million Australian dollar (US$30.2 million) Sydney property that he ruled had been purchased illegally by a foreign-owned company. Since then, the <span class="companylink">Australian Taxation Office</span> ruled that more than 25 further homes unlawfully held by foreign nationals would be sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Proposed investment in residential real estate increased to A$60.8 billion in the year to mid-2015, from A$34.7 billion the year before, with a further A$36.2 billion of proposed investment in commercial real estate, according to data from the <span class="companylink">Foreign Investment Review Board</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Approved foreign investment in residential and commercial real estate reached A$96.9 billion in the 2015 financial year, compared with A$74.6 billion the year before, according to data from the <span class="companylink">Foreign Investment Review Board</span>.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar weakened Tuesday, weighed on by soft U.S. economic data and a surge in oil prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wall Street Journal Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of 16 currencies, was recently down 0.4% to 85.68, amid losses against the euro and emerging-market currencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Home-building starts in the U.S. slowed in March[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-housing-starts-fell-8-8-in-february-1461069249] to the lowest level since October, government data showed, providing further evidence for those who believe that global and domestic conditions aren't ideal to warrant an interest-rate increase from the Fed. Expectations of a dovish Fed weaken the dollar, as low rates make the currency less attractive to yield-seeking investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cloudy global growth prospects, a possible U.K. exit from the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> and coming U.S. elections will make it difficult for the Fed to raise rates in coming months, said Shaun Osborne, a strategist at Scotiabank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The bar for rate increases seems to be fairly high at this point," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, a jump in oil prices revved up investors' risk appetites, buoying stocks and the currencies of commodity-producing nations. The benchmark U.S. crude contract ended 3.3% higher at $41.08 a barrel on the <span class="companylink">New York Mercantile Exchange</span>, while the global Brent contract gained 2.6% to end at $44.03 a barrel on the <span class="companylink">ICE</span> Futures Europe exchange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro was recently up 0.4% at $1.1360. The dollar was down 0.7% against the Mexican peso, at 17.30.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Justin Lahart   </div><div>497 words</div><div>18 April 2016</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2016, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spring is coming to the housing market. Probably.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is over a decade since the housing bust began, and the U.S. housing market isn't close to what historically would be considered normal. Last year, a combined 5.1 million new and used homes were sold in the U.S -- not quite as many as in 1998, when the working-age population was one-fifth lower than it is now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conditions for improvement are there. The job market has continued to strengthen -- there were 2.8 million more people working last month than in the same month a year ago, according to the Labor Department -- bolstering incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is part of why more people are finally striking out, or striking out on their own again. <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> estimates the number of newly formed households eclipsed 1 million last year, marking the first time that has happened since 2006. What's more, the firm estimates 1.2 million new households will be added in each of the next four years. Better finances, low rates and greater willingness among banks may entice more households currently renting to buy, and more homeowners to trade up. Indeed, there are signs of health.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most recent monthly readings on new-home sales and pending sales of existing homes were encouraging. There has been an increase in the number of people applying for a mortgage. The <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span> last week said its index of mortgage applications for purchasing a home was up 24% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The one wrinkle in the housing-revival story is that warm weather over the winter may have made things look better than they actually are. Because housing data are adjusted to account for the big seasonal swings the sector is subject to -- typically around 40% of annual homes sales are inked in the four-month period that starts in March -- if only a little activity gets drawn into the winter months, it can have a pronounced effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That said, last week's beige book -- the collection of anecdotal reports on the economy from <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> Banks -- suggested that housing activity is gaining traction in many parts of the country. The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland</span>, for example, noted that home sales had increased in the region, with builders and real-estate agents attributing the pickup to "low interest rates and continued pent-up demand."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And commenting on the increase in mortgage applications that <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span> has experienced, finance chief Marianne Lake last Wednesday said: "We are seeing spring activity continuing to be robust."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of which is positive for those associated with housing, from banks to builders to brokers and retailers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Full-fledged recovery for housing is still a while away. But after a long time of near dormancy, it looks like it is starting to stir.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's Recovery Is Lacking Legs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's economy may have stabilized for now, thanks to gobs of new debt and a reflating property bubble. Dipping into that old bag of tricks, however, seems likely to dredge up the same old problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Official data showed growth in China's gross domestic product slowed to 6.7% in the first quarter from a year earlier. As expected, that is the slowest in years, but underlying data showed activity picked up toward the end of the quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home buyers, for instance, continued to splash out for new property, with residential sales rising 54% in the first quarter from a year earlier. That has emboldened developers to start to build again. Housing starts rose 16% in the first quarter, after falling 15% last year. That augurs well for employment and demand for raw materials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is hard to see China's property market -- which in past years generated directly and indirectly up to a third of all economic activity -- returning to its past glory. Much of the recovery in prices and activity has been in China's so-called tier-one cities -- the four largest ones -- and regulators there are already clamping down to prevent things from getting out of hand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the rest of China, the property recovery is far more subdued, and inventories of unsold apartments remain substantial. Around 95% of real-estate sales occur outside of those top four cities, notes Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics, so unless the boom spreads, the impact on the broader economy will remain muted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's old-economy sectors also seem to have awoken somewhat from their slumber. Industrial production grew 6.8% in March, the fastest in nine months. Fixed-asset investment, spending on things like factories and infrastructure, grew 11.2%, much faster than the 6.8% low it hit in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Driving all this activity: easy money. Real interest rates have fallen. And nominal GDP grew faster than real GDP for the first time in five quarters, which in theory makes servicing debt easier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What should trouble investors is that while China's economic activity is ticking up, debt is piling up faster. The stock of total financing in the economy, including bond issuance as part of a local-government bailout program, rose 15.8% in March from a year earlier, the fastest rate since mid-2014. With nominal GDP growing 7.2%, Beijing's plans to deleverage the economy continue to be overwhelmed by the need to support growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China bulls will be pleased by the data, hoping that a proper recovery is at hand. Those hopes may prove short lived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The more the recovery is fueled by debt and property, the more concerned Beijing will be that it is pushing the gas too hard and will have to ease off sooner than people think.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Alex Frangos</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Big Slowdown for Biotech Stocks Doesn't Have to Last</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slowing growth has cooled valuations of large biotech stocks. That could pave the way for a rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starting this week, the five biggest U.S. biotech companies by market value are expected to report aggregate first-quarter sales growth of 9.2% from a year earlier, according to analysts' estimates. On the other hand, analysts expect the five largest U.S. pharma companies to increase their top line by 5.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Granted, biotech companies -- firms that traditionally develop drugs derived from living cells rather than those derived from chemicals -- tend to grow at a faster rate than big pharma. But their pace has slackened. A year ago, big biotech companies increased revenue at a 29% year-over-year clip, while sales at big pharma companies dipped slightly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That happened as biotech companies benefited from scientific breakthroughs, which helped push shares into overdrive. Pharma companies were hampered by old blockbuster treatments losing patent protection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result: The Nasdaq Biotechnology Index outperformed the NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical Index by 260 percentage points over the five years to the biotech index's peak in July 2015. Since that peak, the sector is down by one-quarter while pharma is off about 15%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the line between the growth profiles of the two types of companies is blurring. Biotech has slowed in part because products like <span class="companylink">Gilead Sciences</span>' hepatitis C drugs generated such extraordinary growth in the first place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And insurers' concerns over the prices of new, expensive drugs have resulted in slow launches for potential blockbusters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, several major acquisitions completed last year flatter the pharma growth profile, along with a reduction in the pace of key patent expirations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet valuations between the two areas have been coming more in line. The biotech index fetches 23 times forward earnings, down from more than 30 times last summer.While that is still at a premium to the pharma index at 15 times, the biotech index is loaded with smaller, unprofitable companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a more reasonable valuation, biotech has greater potential to surprise. Slow product launches don't necessarily doom new drugs. And new clinical data coming out this year could again reinvigorate biotech growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Biotech investors may find a lower bar is easier to clear.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Car Market</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Isn't Wholly</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About Speed</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The European car market continues to race ahead, with registrations up 8.2% in the first quarter. But focusing on car sales may miss the point. The French volume car manufacturers are trying to put their days as adolescent speed fiends behind them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 1.7 million new cars were sold in the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> in March, the crucial peak month. That was 6% more than in March 2015, fueled by catch-up growth in Italy and France. First-quarter sales in the former were a full 21% ahead of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The European market as a whole is decelerating, following growth of 9.3% last year. But it remains much stronger than most analysts and manufacturers had forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer sentiment is recovering from the eurozone crisis of 2011-2012. But this is also a market driven by cheap debt and cheap oil, both of which look around cyclical lows. Low valuations for car manufacturers reflect market worries that trading conditions can't get much better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These worries are probably premature. In the Western European market, first-quarter registrations were still below their level for every year between 1998 and 2008 -- and a full 8.4% below the most recent 2006 peak. With more car sales funded by debt, and little sign of upward pressure on European rates, a gradual slowdown looks more likely than a sudden reversal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The irony is that near-death experiences during the eurozone crisis forced most European volume car manufacturers tofocus on marginsrather than volumes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Auto investors shouldn't get too hung up about sales statistics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Stephen Wilmot</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overheard</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors in retailers often cheer share repurchases as signs of management confidence. But companies may have less-optimistic reasons for buying back stock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> analysts found 38 of 50 retail and apparel companies they cover repurchased shares in fiscal 2015. The bank set out to determine how bullish that is for future performance, looking at buybacks across the group since 2011. It focused on instances of companies repurchasing 5% or more of outstanding shares within a year. Of 71 instances, on average, the stocks underperformed the S&amp;P Retail Index by more than 10 percentage points in the year following the repurchase, Citi found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stocks underperformed the index in the year following the repurchases in 44 of 71 instances, outperforming only 27 times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That suggests companies may buy back stock to cushion earnings per share the following year. Instead of applauding buybacks, investors should question their motive.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's economy may have stabilized for now, thanks to gobs of new debt and a reflating property bubble. Dipping into that old bag of tricks, however, seems likely to dredge up the same old problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Official data showed growth in China's gross domestic product slowed to 6.7% in the first quarter from a year earlier. As expected, that is the slowest in years, but underlying data showed activity picked up toward the end of the quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home buyers, for instance, continued to splash out for new property, with residential sales rising 54% in the first quarter from a year earlier. That has emboldened developers to start to build again. Housing starts rose 16% in the first quarter, after falling 15% last year. That augurs well for employment and demand for materials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is hard to see China's property market -- which in past years generated directly and indirectly up to a third of all economic activity -- returning to its past glory. Much of the recovery in prices and activity has been in China's so-called tier-one cities -- the four largest ones -- and regulators there are already clamping down to prevent things from getting out of hand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the rest of China, the property recovery is far more subdued, and inventories of unsold apartments remain substantial. Around 95% of real-estate sales occur outside of those top four cities, notes Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics, so unless the boom spreads, the impact on the broader economy will remain muted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's old-economy sectors also seem to have awoken somewhat from their slumber. Industrial production grew 6.8% in March, the fastest in nine months. Fixed-asset investment, spending on things like factories and infrastructure, grew 11.2%, much faster than the 6.8% low in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Driving all this activity: easy money. Real interest rates have fallen. And nominal GDP grew faster than real GDP for the first time in five quarters, which in theory makes servicing debt easier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What should trouble investors is that while China's economic activity is ticking up, debt is piling up faster. The stock of total financing in the economy, including bond issuance as part of a local-government bailout program, rose 15.8% in March from a year earlier, the fastest rate since mid-2014. With nominal GDP growing 7.2%, Beijing's plans to deleverage the economy continue to be overwhelmed by the need to support growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China bulls will be pleased by the data, hoping that a proper recovery is at hand. Those hopes may prove short lived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The more the recovery is fueled by debt and property, the more concerned Beijing will be that it is pushing the gas too hard and will have to ease off sooner than people think.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Big Slowdown for Biotech Stocks Doesn't Have to Last</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slowing growth has cooled valuations of large biotech stocks. That could pave the way for a rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starting this week, the five biggest U.S. biotech companies by market value are expected to report aggregate first-quarter sales growth of 9.2% from a year earlier, according to analysts' estimates. On the other hand, analysts expect the five largest U.S. pharma companies to increase their top line by 5.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Granted, biotech companies -- firms that traditionally develop drugs derived from living cells rather than those derived from chemicals -- tend to grow at a faster rate than big pharma. But their pace has slackened. A year ago, big biotech companies increased revenue at a 29% year-over-year clip, while sales at big pharma companies dipped slightly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That happened as biotech companies benefited from scientific breakthroughs, which helped push shares into overdrive. Pharma companies were hampered by old blockbuster treatments losing patent protection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result: The Nasdaq Biotechnology Index outperformed the NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical Index by 260 percentage points over the five years to the biotech index's peak in July 2015. Since that peak, the sector is down by one-quarter while pharma is off about 15%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the line between the growth profiles of the two types of companies is blurring. Biotech has slowed in part because products like <span class="companylink">Gilead Sciences</span>' hepatitis C drugs generated such extraordinary growth in the first place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And insurers' concerns over the prices of new, expensive drugs have resulted in slow launches for potential blockbusters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, several major acquisitions completed last year flatter the pharma growth profile, along with a reduction in the pace of key patent expirations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet valuations between the two areas have been coming more in line. The biotech index fetches 23 times forward earnings, down from more than 30 times last summer.While that is still at a premium to the pharma index at 15 times, the biotech index is loaded with smaller, unprofitable companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a more reasonable valuation, biotech has greater potential to surprise. Slow product launches don't necessarily doom new drugs. And new clinical data coming out this year could again reinvigorate biotech growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Biotech investors may find a lower bar is easier to clear.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SUV Boom</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revs Up <span class="companylink">Ford</span>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sport-utility vehicles are the kings of China's auto market, and <span class="companylink">Ford Motor</span> is well placed in the royal court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Car makers in China shipped 52% more SUVs in the first quarter than in the same period the year before. In no month since 2015 has growth dipped below 34%. In response, Chinese manufacturers have flooded the market with low-end SUVs, some equipped with tiny 1.6-liter engines that qualify for tax incentives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There will be 32 new budget SUVs launched this year versus 20 in 2013, according to Sanford C. Bernstein's Robin Zhu.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With so much new supply, pricing has begun taking a hit. But <span class="companylink">Ford</span> has an advantage: Its bigger SUVs don't compete directly with the small, underpowered ones. While its SUV sales grew just 38% between January and March from a year ago, its local passenger-car joint venture with <span class="companylink">Chongqing Changan Automobile</span> has lately achieved the lowest dealer discounts among all such ventures in China, according to data from Macquarie and research firm ISE. So <span class="companylink">Ford</span> likely won't spend as much on incentives or cut the official prices of its cars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More SUVs, which command higher margins than sedans, mean more profits for <span class="companylink">Ford</span>'s partner Changan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Changan shares in Shenzhen that foreigners can trade fetch only 4.75 times forward earnings versus an average 8.72 times for seven peers, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The more consumers flock to <span class="companylink">Ford</span> SUVs, the more investors should move into Changan shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Abheek Bhattacharya</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overheard</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors in retailers often cheer share repurchases as signs of management confidence. But companies may have less-optimistic reasons for buying back stock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> analysts found 38 of 50 retail and apparel companies they cover repurchased shares in fiscal 2015. The bank set out to determine how bullish that is for future performance, looking at buybacks across the group since 2011. It focused on instances of companies repurchasing 5% or more of outstanding shares within a year. Of 71 instances, on average, the stocks underperformed the S&amp;P Retail Index by more than 10 percentage points in the year following the repurchase, Citi found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stocks underperformed the index in the year following the repurchases in 44 of 71 instances, outperforming only 27 times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That suggests companies may buy back stock to cushion earnings per share the following year. Instead of applauding buybacks, investors should question their motive.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.K. commercial real-estate values could fall if Britain votes to end its <span class="companylink">European Union</span> membership in June, credit-rating firm <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's Corp</span>. said in a report on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.K. is set to hold a referendum over its relationship with the EU[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/brexit-carries-risks-for-both-u-k-europe-1457033897] on June 23. Uncertainty leading up to the public vote “is likely to have a paralyzing effect on investor decisions on U.K. real-estate purchases," Marie-Aude Vialle, a credit analyst at the credit-rating firm, said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exiting the <span class="companylink">EU</span> “could potentially reverse the significant boost to real-estate asset values[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-k-commercial-property-investment-soars-to-new-record-1453478371] that the U.K., and London in particular, has experienced in recent years," S&amp;P said in a report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Office buildings in London's main financial district, called the City, would be worst hit, S&amp;P said. Although less so than commercial real estate, housing markets, especially in London, are also susceptible.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">S&amp;P is the latest group to warn of a negative impact for the U.K. property markets due to the referendum. The company has previously said its stance on <span class="companylink">U.K. government</span> credit could suffer should Britain part ways with the EU[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/a-british-exit-from-the-eu-would-have-global-consequences-1452457222].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overseas investors have already been pulling back from London commercial property, such as offices and shops, due to concerns about slowing global economic growth and the collapse in oil prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign buyers have long perceived that U.K. property provides a haven from political and financial volatility. A vote to leave the <span class="companylink">EU</span> in June “would likely threaten that perception of safety," the S&amp;P report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">S&amp;P has ratings on several U.K. property companies, including <span class="companylink">Derwent London PLC</span>, <span class="companylink">Kennedy Wilson Europe Real Estate PLC</span>, <span class="companylink">Grainger PLC</span> and <span class="companylink">Taylor Wimpey PLC</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Brexit would be overall a negative rating event that we would need to evaluate versus the financial cushion they have amassed at their current rating level," the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to weaker demand for property, banks and other financial services firms could choose to reduce office space in London, causing rents to fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, large U.K. real-estate firms have benefited from the recent property boom, and have lower levels of debt compared with the value of their assets—the so-called loan-to-value ratio—than in the 2008 financial crisis, S&amp;P said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This provides a large degree of cushion to LTV ratios for large office players in the U.K. should property valuations drop," the report said. For instance, Derwent London had a loan-to-value ratio of just 17.8% in December, compared with nearly 40% in December 2008, S&amp;P said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto and Rita Trichur   </div><div>886 words</div><div>6 April 2016</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2016, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market in Calgary, capital of Canada's struggling energy sector, has been hit so hard it makes the challenges faced by U.S. oil towns look relatively mild.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">March home-sales volume tumbled 11% from the same period last year, according to the Calgary Real Estate Board. Some 2,000 miles to the south in the headquarters of the U.S. oil industry, Houston, home sales were up 2% in February -- the most recent data available -- compared with the same month last year, according to the <span class="companylink">Houston Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Calgary, the slowdown also has been felt by a wider range of homeowners. In Houston most of the pain so far is being felt among sellers of high-end homes priced at $500,000 and above -- a sector that saw a 12% decrease in sales volume in the year ended in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently, this also was true in Calgary. The slowdown had been more or less confined to high-end homes worth C$700,000 (US$534,800) and higher. But now that trend is playing out in lower price ranges as well, especially in the C$500,000 to C$600,000 range, which includes the majority of the detached homes, according to Ann-Marie Lurie, chief economist with the Calgary Real Estate Board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, brokers in Calgary are reporting that sellers have been offering a range of incentives to buyers, including a Tesla automobile in one case. Many prospective buyers are retreating to the sidelines in that city, brokers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I haven't got a buyer in real estate right now who isn't petrified to even buy," said Keith Crawford, a Calgary-based realtor with Century 21, adding buyers aren't sure if prices have hit a bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calgary's housing market is suffering more partly because this city of about 1.2 million people has a less diversified economy than Houston. Also, Canada's economy overall also remains vulnerable to a slowdown right now, while the U.S. economy remains strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, Calgary's oil industry is more dependent on a pricey method of extraction that is more vulnerable to a drop in oil prices. "We are a higher-cost producer area. And we can see it with these lower [oil] prices. It really has translated into significant amount of layoffs," Ms. Lurie said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Natural-resources employment in Alberta, the province that includes Calgary, decreased by 7,400, according to the Alberta Treasury Board and Finance, helping bring the unemployment rate to 7.9% -- the highest in two decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, the unemployment rate is a still-modest 4.8% in Houston, which also has employers inhealth care and aerospace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much like Houston, Calgary's real-estate market was more deeply affected when oil prices declined during the 1980s. "In the '80s, it was a far steeper impact because at that time, we were even more reliant on oil than we are today," Ms. Lurie said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Averages home prices in Calgary have fallen nearly 5% from their high of C$491,609 in June 2014. That still is well below the 25% drop they took in the 1980s, unadjusted for inflation. Calgary's average home price was C$468,572 in March, down more than 1% compared with the same month last year, according to the Calgary Real Estate Board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Houston, the average home price edged up 0.5% to nearly $261,000 in February compared with one year earlier, according to the <span class="companylink">Houston Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers say that the incentives being offered by Calgary home sellers indicate even a greater disparity. Their value is worth about C$3,000 to C$5,000, according to Roy Almog, founder of 2% Realty Inc., a discount brokerage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typically, those inducements include cash back on closing -- funds that could be used to finish a basement, as an example. In other cases, home sellers dangle other goodies such as offers to pay a buyer's condo fees for the first year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Incentives on luxury homes have included golf memberships, but those offers have curtailed a bit. "It's just not selling and so people, for the most part, have taken those homes off the market," said Keith Crawford, a Calgary-based realtor with Century 21.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Crawford recently tried to sell a luxury home, listed at more than C$2 million, that came with an unusual perk: a free Tesla. When that didn't work, he simply lowered the price by an additional C$250,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowdown in Calgary has rippled through the office- and apartment-rental markets. Calgary's downtown office market, once the envy of landlords everywhere, has seen a reversal of fortunes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market has been flooded with space from companies rushing to sublease as well as new supply from towers that broke ground during headier times. This has sent the vacancy rate soaring past 17%, from less than 6% at the end of 2012, while rents have tumbled more than 30% in the same period, according to <span class="companylink">CBRE Group Inc</span>.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEIJING—Two key gauges of Chinese factory output registered a pickup in March on signs that policies aimed at boosting growth were having some impact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's official manufacturing purchasing managers index increased to 50.2 last month month from 49.0 in February[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/china-manufacturing-slows-more-than-expected-1456801369], according to the National Bureau of Statistics. This is the first time in eight months the figure has been at or above 50, the level dividing expansion from contraction. A separate indicator, the private Caixin manufacturing PMI, rose to 49.7 in March from 48.0 in February. The statistics agency also said the official nonmanufacturing PMI rose to 53.8 in March from 52.7 in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said optimism in March among manufacturers was boosted by greater stability in the yuan after a volatile start to 2016, a boost in Chinese stock markets and signaling at China's annual legislative session earlier in the month that growth will remain a priority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Policy pronouncements included a higher target for the nation's fiscal deficit this year, set at 3% of gross domestic product compared with last year's 2.3%. And China cut required bank reserves in late February by 0.5 percentage point to 17%, releasing an estimated $108 billion into the financial system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But economists cautioned that the world's second-largest economy continues to battle deeply entrenched problem[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/china-economic-growth-slows-to-6-9-on-year-in-2015-1453169398]s that could take years to work through.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's quite a significant pickup," said OCBC Bank economist Dongming Xie. “But it doesn't mean we're going back to a very bullish sentiment. Challenges remain, such as overcapacity and high debt, that you can't solve in one or two days."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Official subindexes tracking production, new orders, import prices and new export orders all improved, suggesting the pickup is relatively broad-based, economists said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We suspect this reflects a pick-up in state-led infrastructure spending, although a more buoyant property market may also have played a role," said Julian Evans-Pritchard, an economist with <span class="companylink">Capital Economics</span>, in a research note. He said he saw the improved sentiment as a sign recent stimulus measures are gaining more traction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zhao Qinghe, an economist with the statistics bureau, said the outlook for both large and small companies improved modestly, although the large companies' sentiment moved into expansion territory last month while that of their smaller counterparts remained in contraction. “However, companies are still facing many difficulties in their operations," he said, including funding shortfalls, weak demand and rising costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The March PMI results follow other signs of tepid improvement in the Chinese economy. Prices rose 22% year on year in China's largest real-estate markets in February, according to a private survey, compared with a 19% rise in January even as many smaller property markets continue to struggle. And industrial profits in China rose 4.8% in February from a year earlier, their first increase in a year and a half.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since November 2014, the central bank has cut interest rates six times, reduced banks' reserve requirements several times and ramped up infrastructure spending. Despite the moves, China's economy has struggled to revive. The economy last year grew by 6.9%, its weakest pace in a quarter century, and first-quarter results out later this month are expected to fall below that level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite six interest-rate cuts since November 2014, several reductions in required bank reserves[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/china-cuts-reserve-requirement-ratio-1423047341] and ramped-up infrastructure spending[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/benefits-of-infrastructure-spending-not-so-clear-cut-economists-say-1422819575], China's economy has struggled. The economy last year grew by 6.9%, its weakest pace in a quarter century, and first-quarter results out later this month are expected to fall below that level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weighing down the economy is significant overcapacity in real estate and heavy industries such as coal mining and steel, rapidly rising corporate debt and four years of falling prices at the factory gate. In 2015, China's banks reported their slowest profit growth in 10 years amid rising bad loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jinan Honesty Aluminum Industry Co., a company based in Jinan in eastern China that makes aluminum sheeting and other industrial products, said it is holding off on major capital spending given the bleak outlook moving into 2016. Demand remains weak in China as well as in India and the Middle East, its primary overseas markets, said Sun Jinzhong, a sales manager at the company. “We have few orders," he added. “The situation is much worse this year than last."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Services revised China's credit outlook to negative[http://online.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/article/SB11329365145559643965604581632883047491572.html] from stable given an assessment that financial and economic risks were gradually increasing. Over the next three years, “government and corporate leverage ratios are likely to deteriorate," it said. The move follows a similar downgrade by <span class="companylink">Moody's Investors Service</span> in early March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Shanghai Composite Index was slightly lower in morning trading after the results were posted.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some home buyers should brace themselves for sticker shock: not from the price of the house, but from the property-taxes they'll pay when the deal closes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Jersey, Illinois and New Hampshire have the highest property tax rates in the country, according to a recent study by credit-monitoring website WalletHub.com. Property taxes on a home valued at $175,700, the national median, will set a New Jersey homeowner back $4,029 a year, according to the WalletHub analysis, based on Census Bureau data on rates and median home values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When lenders calculate the monthly mortgage payment to determine a borrower's ability to pay, they include not just principal and interest, but also property taxes and homeowners' insurance prorated across 12 months. For jumbo mortgages -- those above government-backed loan limits of $417,000 in most areas and $625,500 in some high-priced places -- property taxes can be a hefty addition to monthly payments, says John Walsh, CEO of Milford, Conn.-based Total Mortgage Services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The amount of taxes can have a huge impact on your buying power and your ability to qualify," Mr. Walsh says. "People are very worried about interest rates but forget about taxes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowers who are self-employed or who can't document a regular stream of income (even if they have substantial assets) may be particularly vulnerable, says Victor Ciardelli, CEO of Chicago, Ill.-based <span class="companylink">Guaranteed Rate</span>. If property taxes put a borrower's debt-to-income ratio above lender-acceptable levels, usually 43% for jumbo mortgages, a borrower may still qualify but have to make a higher down payment, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Northeastern states typically have the highest tax rates and Southern states the lowest, but rates can vary widely locally by counties and municipalities within a state, says Jill Gonzalez, a WalletHub analyst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, a $4.5 million home in Stamford, Conn., will set back a homeowner $74,695 a year in property taxes, while the same home in Greenwich, Conn., costs just $29,655, Mr. Walsh says. "That's an additional $3,752 per month to own the same $4.5 million house in Stamford," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In competitive housing markets, sale prices are rising so rapidly that tax assessments may eventually rise as well. For example, in the Denver metro area, home values are 45.29% above peak prerecession prices, according to the latest Home Price Recovery Index by mortgage-rate tracking website HSH.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since there is typically a lag between a sale and the updated assessment, home buyers for the most part don't have to worry about it affecting their ability to qualify for a home loan. Lenders typically use the current assessed value and tax amount when a borrower is buying or refinancing a home, Mr. Ciardelli says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, there are a few exceptions. In Florida, for example, the lender will estimate and base loan approval on anticipated tax rates in the future, says Mark Shulman, chief credit officer for SunTrust Mortgage. In Florida, when a primary residence qualifies for the homestead exemption, annual increases in property taxes are limited to a small percentage rather than following home sales trends, he adds. Therefore, lenders know that the property-tax assessment can jump significantly after a purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are a few more property-related tax considerations for high-end home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Other property-related taxes. Some states, such as New York and Florida, levy additional real-estate-related taxes on home buyers that must be paid at closing. For example, New York mortgage tax rates vary from 0.75% in some rural counties to 2.175% for all mortgages of $500,000 or more in New York City, but 0.25% is typically paid by the lender. New York City also has a one-time 1% "mansion tax" on properties over $1 million. Some municipalities also levy one-time taxes on the transaction, Mr. Walsh says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Taxes are just one homeowner expense. Don't let low property taxes tantalize you or high property taxes necessarily scare you away from buying where you want to live, says Ms. Gonzalez, of WalletHub. Hawaii has one of the lowest property-tax rates in the country, according to the company's analysis. But with a median home value of $504,500, it has some of the highest real-estate prices in the U.S., she adds. Conversely, Chicago may have the second-highest property-tax rates, but otherwise is pretty affordable compared with other major U.S. cities, Mr. Ciardelli says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- When to consider an appeal. If an assessment seems high, a homeowner has little to lose in trying to appeal the amount, Mr. Ciardelli says. Lowering the amount one pays in property taxes may help one qualify for a future refinance, he adds.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Erica E. Phillips   </div><div>672 words</div><div>30 March 2016</div><div>17:06</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rental rates for industrial real estate surged in the U.S. in 2015, boosted by the economic recovery and historically low vacancies in major logistics markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first annual Prologis Logistics Rent Index report, which examined net effective rents in 57 major global markets, found that the U.S. outpaced the rest of the world in 2015 in the growth of industrial rental costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Domestic industrial rents rose 9% last year and were up 25% over the past three years. Globally, rate growth was also strong, with rents rising 6% last year and more than 20% since 2012, according to analysts with <span class="companylink">Prologis Inc</span>., the world's largest owner of industrial real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The U.S. is absolutely in an expansion mode," with customers growing and vacancy rates falling to all-time lows in many markets, said Chris Caton, head of research at Prologis. The top five markets in the world with the fastest-growing industrial rental rates were all in the U.S., and many of the current rates have surpassed the previous peaks following a retreat after the recession.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Discounts from the recession are being unwound," Mr. Caton said, and new contracts are reaching current market rates as warehouse and distribution space comes up for renewal. Markets including Chicago and Atlanta saw rates rise largely due to these factors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its most recent quarterly earnings, Prologis reported a 2015 occupancy rate of 97% across its real estate portfolio. The company said the current industrial vacancy rate in the U.S. is 5.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economic recovery, along with the rise of e-commerce, has driven up demand as growing businesses add warehouse space and seek to upgrade from their current facilities. But the addition of warehouse capacity has lagged behind demand in some markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In San Francisco, Los Angeles, New Jersey and South Florida, for example, industrial real-estate developers face barriers such as a lack of available land that can accommodate a large warehouse. Getting development permits and approval from local communities also is a challenge in some places, Mr. Caton said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is growing demand for warehouses close to cities to serve e-commerce demands for rapid delivery, but that can put industrial developers in closer competition for different kinds of real-estate projects, including housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Either it's just not feasible to construct a logistics facility or you might have an older logistics facility be bought up and turned into something else," he said—all of which drives up rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial developments that do break ground face higher costs as land prices rise, general contractors are in higher demand and lower unemployment means labor rates have gone up. “Replacement costs," as Mr. Caton called them, are rising in markets across the U.S. and globally. “I think replacement costs are definitely going to be the story of 2016," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the report, rents will likely rise 5% to 10% this year in major markets. <span class="companylink">Prologis</span> advised that customers could see rents as much as 10% to 20% higher than the last time they leased space under multiyear deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seattle, Southern California, Central Florida and Atlanta will likely see rates rise “quickly" this year, although in general the U.S. nationally should be more stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I would expect 9% to not be repeated, and for it to be lower," Mr. Caton said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the growth in the U.S., the highest rental rates globally were in the United Kingdom, Japan and Singapore, where replacement costs also are rising significantly. Land values and labor costs are also going up in China, where, Mr. Caton said, “e-commerce is an important part of that story."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">London house prices hit a record average of £530,368 ($762,890) in February, but growth is shifting away from prime central neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average London house sold for 13.5% more than a year earlier, and continued to extend away from the £190,275 average across England and Wales, according to Land Registry data released Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising prices in the U.K. capital have been pushing buyers to look further afield. Towns within commuting distance, and especially those with new transport infrastructure, have benefited most.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Slough, the setting for the U.K. version of television series “The Office," prices climbed 19% in the past year, more than anywhere else in the country, Land Registry data show. Slough is located on a new train line, called Crossrail, that will travel through central London when it opens next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average price in Luton, site of a major London airport, has risen 17% over the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast, prices in London's poshest districts were down 0.8% in the first quarter of 2016, and are 6.7% lower than the 2014 peak, according to property broker Savills PLC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Concerns over global economic growth and the upcoming vote on Britain's European Union membership[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/david-cameron-to-announce-eu-referendum-date-after-cabinet-meeting-1455964352] have caused a pause among overseas investors, a mainstay of the high-end market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Unlike other parts of the London housing market, the prime markets remain fairly price-sensitive and increasingly dominated by needs-based buyers," said Lucian Cook, head of U.K. residential research, in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, luxury homes in central London fell out of favor with international investors. In addition to global economic concerns, a higher transaction tax, called stamp duty[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/london-rental-home-prices-rise-ahead-of-buy-to-let-stamp-duty-1455148860], tempered the enthusiasm of buyers contending with prices that had been rising sharply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Relief for central neighborhoods isn't likely to come anytime soon. Uncertainty over the <span class="companylink">EU</span> referendum, set for June, is expected to continue to slow demand for luxury homes in the U.K. capital. <span class="companylink">Savills</span> on Tuesday also said the prime London real-estate market is still adjusting to the 2014 tax changes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite weakness at the top end of the market, the imbalance between overall London prices and those in the rest of the U.K. has become starker over the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In London, prices have vaulted past highs hit before the financial crisis in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere, home values are still falling. In the northeast of England, prices have dropped 3.2% in the past year to February, with the average now at £97,582, the Land Registry data show.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto  </div><div>484 words</div><div>29 March 2016</div><div>09:41</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices continued rising at a steady clip in January, another sign that 2016 will offer more of the same in the housing market: tight inventory leading to rising prices and sales volatility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index, covering the entire nation, rose 5.4% in the 12 months ended in January  [https://www.spice-indices.com/idpfiles/spice-assets/resources/public/documents/323944_cshomeprice-release-0329.pdf?force_download=true], slightly greater than a 5.3% increase in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-city index gained 5.1% from a year earlier and the 20-city index gained 5.7% year-over-year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected a 5.8% increase in the 20-city index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After years of volatility, home-price growth appears to have stabilized at an annual rate of close to 5%. But the pace of sales has fluctuated, in part because of a lack of homes for sale and because high prices have started to scare some buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hottest markets in the country, primarily on the West Coast, continued to show double-digit price gains, with Portland reporting an 11.8% year-over-year jump, Seattle showing a 10.7% gain, and San Francisco prices advancing 10.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists expect home-price growth to moderate in 2016, as buyers begin to reach the limits of what they can afford, especially in the most expensive markets. That can crowd out first-time buyers, who may also face student loans and credit-card debt that make it difficult for them to take on a large mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“While low inventories and short supply are boosting prices, financing continues to be a concern for some potential purchasers, particularly young adults and first-time home buyers," said David Blitzer, managing director at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes tumbled 7.1% in February  [http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-tumble-in-february-1458569262] from the prior month, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said last week. <span class="companylink">Realtors</span> blamed the lack of inventory, rising prices, the January blizzard on the East Coast, and a slump in the stock market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still real-estate agents expect activity to pick up during the spring selling season. A forward-looking indicator—the number of existing homes that went under contract— rose 3.5% in February  [http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/pending-home-sales-jump-3-5-in-february-1459173601] to its highest level in seven months, <span class="companylink">NAR</span> said on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rebecca Walter, an agent with Redfin in Portland, said she didn't list a single home in February. “February was my slowest month in a long time," she said. “However, she added, “activity has come back with a vengeance."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Walter said she expects to list a dozen homes in the coming four to six weeks, as sellers gear up for the spring season.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Steven Russolillo   </div><div>338 words</div><div>29 March 2016</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2016, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current economic environment seems wonderful for home builders. Their stock prices don't agree, though, perhaps with good reason.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low interest rates, an improving job market and rising rents suggest the business should be booming. Relatively low inventory of existing homes for sale is pushing the values of both old and new ones higher. In terms of months of supply, the number of existing homes is near its lowest in over a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That backdrop will play a role in <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>.'s fiscal first-quarter results, out Tuesday. While those positive macroeconomic factors are at play, the market is betting the cost of business for a firm like <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> is starting to catch up with it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fears of a profitability pinch help explain why home-builder stocks remain well off their summer highs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As MKM Partners analyst Megan McGrath explains it, home builders aren't profiting as much in the entry-level market for homes priced at $200,000 and below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And for <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> specifically, its shares, fetching 1.8 times book value, might be too rich for the current environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is some 20% above its 10-year average. Typically when large builders like <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> approach 2 times book value, it becomes a red flag for future stock performance, according to Ms. McGrath.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, if <span class="companylink">Lennar</span>'s gross margins and order book through February please analysts, its stock could edge higher. But another indicator of housing market health on Tuesday bears watching: the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 20-city gauge was seen rising by 5.8% in January from a year earlier, according to economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. That doesn't suggest a runaway market, or one that will help offset <span class="companylink">Lennar</span>'s rising costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market's foundation remains solid. But it is lacking the flair to propel home-builder stocks much higher.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the broader mortgage market remains in the doldrums, banks are again touting home-equity lines of credit, which allow homeowners to draw down the equity in their homes as they need the cash, as well as cash-out refinances, which involve taking cash out of a home while refinancing and ending up with a larger mortgage balance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The effort is gaining steam as banks try to offset faltering mortgage originations and a refinancing wave that is fizzling out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders are betting that offers for home-equity lines of credit, or helocs, will resonate with many borrowers whose home values are higher than they were just a couple of years ago and who need cash for renovations or other expenses after holding on to their homes for longer than expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders extended just over $156 billion in home-equity lines of credit last year, the largest dollar amount since 2007,the beginning ofthe housing bust, according to new figures from mortgage-data firm <span class="companylink">CoreLogic Inc</span>. That marks a 24% increase from 2014 and a138% rise from 2010, when new approvals hit a low point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average line amount extended to homeowners last year reached a record $119,790, according to the firm, which tracks the data to 2002.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Lenders are opening up their spigots," said Sam Khater, deputy chief economist at <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The volumes are nowhere near the amounts given out before the housing bust, when lenders were approving more than $300 billion in credit lines a year. Housing analysts said it is unlikely that equity lending will return to those levels in the near future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The push from banks marks a strategic reversal for many. Lenders scaled back on giving out second liens in the wake of the housing downturn, and many cut existing credit lines to avoid new defaults. Some lenders exited from the home-equity lending market entirely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The renewed appetite for these loans comes as property values continue to rise, increasing the number of homeowners who have equity available for withdrawal. Nationally, homes have regained nearly all of the value they lost during the housing bust and are hoveringabout 5% below their all-time peak in 2006, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co</span>. began reaching out to customers in January about the benefits of cash-out refinances, saying the move is often a smart way to tackle home repairs, debt consolidation and tuition payments.The campaign is a first for the bank, said a spokeswoman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">PNC Financial Services Group Inc</span>. ramped up home-equity-line marketing to existing customers last yearand is planning a bigger push in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TD Bank, the U.S. unit of <span class="companylink">Toronto-Dominion Bank</span> that has roughly 1,300 branches in the eastern U.S., opted for its marketing campaign this year in lieu of its usual drive to get traditional mortgage business in the spring homebuying season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank "is placing a bet. . .home equity will play a bigger part of our business,"said Mike Kinane, senior vice president of home-equity lending at the firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-equity lines can be risky because they generally have variable interest rates, which could rise, leading to larger monthly payments for borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many home-equity lines are also structured to allow borrowers to put off principal payments for the first 10 years. Once principal is due, payments can jump by hundreds or thousands of dollars. For banks, these payment shocks could lead to an increase in delinquencies many years after they have given out the loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders are requiring higher credit scores this time around, and in most cases borrowers must have at least 20% equity left in their home after receiving the credit line. The average weighted FICO score for borrowers who received a home-equity line in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 781, on a scale that ranges from 300 to 850, compared with 742 for the same period in 2005, according to <span class="companylink">Black Knight Financial Services</span>, a mortgage-data firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vicki Boddy and her husband, Mike, received a $125,000 home-equity line of credit from <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> in February, after their home was appraised at $447,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Boddys have lived in the same home in Kenmore, Wash., for the past 23 years.They wanted to renovate the kitchen and other parts of the homeand chose to borrow rather than use savings to pay for it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Having the heloc means we can use the money in savings for reserves and a vacation to go visit our kids," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three largest home-equity lenders increased originations last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>. gave out $13 billion in credit lines and home-equity loans, up 17% from 2014; <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo &amp; Co</span>.'s $12.5 billion in home-equity-line originations marked a 36% increase; and <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> gave out $6 billion in home-equity lines, a 62% increase, according to the trade publication Inside Mortgage Finance.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best way to get the home-court advantage in basketball? Buy a home with its own sports court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 1,000 luxury homes with basketball courts are for sale, with a median price of $1.86 million -- a premium of $215,000, or 13%, over homes without courts. Indoor courts are even rarer and pricier: only 85 are on the market, with a median price of $2.99 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers are based on a Realtor.com analysis of single-family homes listed for $1 million and up as of March 4 that advertised having a half-court, full court or multisport court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a court is an expensive feature, the sheer space it occupies also contributes to the premium, said Javier Vivas, an economic researcher for Realtor.com, noting that the premium varies widely by market. Homes with courts are typically 29% larger and sit on lots 33% bigger than other homes. "You're paying more for this luxury, but you're also getting a bit more space," said Mr. Vivas. (<span class="companylink">News Corp</span>, which owns The Wall Street Journal, also owns Realtor.com, the listing website of the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home courts are commonly 30 feet long by 50 feet wide but can be almost any size, said Joel McCausland, a regional director at Sport Court, a Salt Lake City-based manufacturer of sports surfacing and components.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They tend to appeal to buyers with children, who see them as an amenity that will keep kids active and close to home, said Jeff Hendley, a broker with LIV Sotheby's International Realty in Denver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Installing a court generally costs between $15,000 and $30,000 -- depending on the size, cost of labor and materials, and features like hoops and lights -- and takes a few weeks, said Mr. McCausland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When building his early-retirement home near Asheville, N.C., last year, dermatologist David Schoenfeld, 47, decided to add a sports court in the basement at his son's request -- an appeal that gained traction when a friend endorsed the idea. The 1,400-square-foot court added about 2 1/2 months to the 19-month project and about 15% more to his overall costs, said Dr. Schoenfeld, who declined to disclose the full price tag.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Schoenfeld regularly hosts friends and family on the court, and encourages guests to hang pennants from their alma maters on the walls. And Dr. Schoenfeld's son? "He thinks it's the greatest thing ever."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Rebecca Davis O’Brien   </div><div>922 words</div><div>22 March 2016</div><div>20:50</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New York City comptroller is examining a decision by Mayor Bill de Blasio's administration to lift deed restrictions on a Manhattan building, a move that led to a nursing home operator making a $72 million profit off the property's sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comptroller Scott Stringer has asked a city agency for details on its decision last year to remove restrictions that had limited the use of Rivington House on the Lower East Side to a not-for-profit residential health-care center. The 118-year-old, 150,000-square-foot building at 45 Rivington St. had previously served HIV/AIDS patients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In early 2015, the Allure Group, a for-profit nursing care provider, purchased the building for $28 million, and months later paid the city $16.15 million to remove the restrictions that limited the building's use, records show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About three months after the city lifted the restrictions, Allure sold the building for $116 million to a residential developer[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/chinese-developer-beefs-up-nyc-portfolio-with-deal-on-lower-east-side-1456704425] that plans to convert it into luxury condominiums, over the objections of some community leaders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials in the mayor's office and at the Department of Citywide Administrative Services, the agency that lifted the deed restriction, had understood at the time that the property would be turned into a for-profit nursing home, Austin Finan, a spokesman for Mr. de Blasio, said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The city was as disappointed as local residents to later learn not only that the property would no longer provide needed health services but that the valuation of the deed restriction did not reflect current market values that could have generated affordable housing or other uses for the public's benefit," Mr. Finan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since March 1, all deed restriction applications at DCAS have been placed on hold pending a top-down review of the agency launched by the new commissioner, who took office in January, Mr. Finan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A representative from Allure couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a March 7 letter to DCAS, Mr. Stringer questioned whether the deal shortchanged taxpayers and cited concerns about a lack of public discussion about lifting the deed restrictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stringer, a Democrat who serves as the city's chief financial officer, said in a statement he wanted the city to disclose the details behind the deal to ensure it was in the public's best interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is incomprehensible that this property, which provided long-term care for patients with HIV/AIDS for more than two decades, would reportedly be converted into market-rate luxury housing without robust discussion, transparency and input from the community it serves," Mr. Stringer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked about concerns that the $16.15 million payment shortchanged the taxpayers, Mr. Finan said the “processes by which deed restrictions are valued, and restriction removals are authorized" are under review and “subject to overhaul."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Mr. Stringer's letter, which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, the comptroller asked DCAS for any appraisals that were conducted to ascertain the value of the deed restriction, as well as any studies on the need for housing and health-care facilities on the Lower East Side. The letter also asks for the agency's policies on the sale and removal of restrictive deeds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a letter dated March 11, Lisette Camilo, the new DCAS commissioner, told Mr. Stringer that the agency was gathering the information he requested.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the deed modification, which was signed by a DCAS deputy commissioner and an Allure executive, the city ordered an appraisal of the property. After a public hearing in June 2015, the city removed the deed restriction.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Built in 1898 as a public school, 45 Rivington St. was bought in 1992 by VillageCare, a not-for-profit that serves people with chronic-care needs, and became a nursing home for HIV/AIDS patients. In 2014, citing declining patient numbers, VillageCare said it was closing the facility, according to meeting minutes from the local community board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, leaders at the community board said they hoped to have the building converted to a nursing home for the general population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City lobbying records show VillageCare spent $44,000 and $40,000 in 2013 and 2014, respectively, on the services of James F. Capalino &amp; Associates, a city lobbying firm. The lobbying was focused on DCAS and the “deed restriction," records show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A VillageCare spokesman didn't respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February, the U.S. unit of <span class="companylink">China Vanke Co</span>., together with Slate Property Group and Adam America Real Estate, paid $116 million for the building. A Slate co-founder said the group planned to convert the building into luxury apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale and planned conversion of the building surprised and disappointed some community groups and elected officials who had fought to keep the property dedicated to nursing care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We thought everything was going to be fine," said Councilwoman Margaret Chin, a Manhattan Democrat whose district includes the building. “Now we might get stuck with a luxury condo building. This is not what the community fought for."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Josh Mitchell   </div><div>492 words</div><div>23 March 2016</div><div>12:30</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Sales of newly built homes are rising amid steady job growth and a scarcity of older homes on the market, another sign the U.S. economic expansion remains stable despite troubles abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
New-home sales grew 2% in February[https://www-census-gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/construction/nrs/pdf/newressales.pdf] from a month earlier, hitting an annual pace of 512,000, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. That put the industry on track to eclipse the 501,000 homes sold throughout 2015, the best year since 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New homes represent just a tenth of all home sales, and monthly swings often obscure broader trends. February's figure came with a margin of error of plus or minus 18.8 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The broader picture shows an uneven market. Sales were down nearly 4% in the first two months of this year compared with the same period in 2015. But over the past 12 months, they have risen compared with the prior year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This reflects a slow but steady increase in demand from homebuyers as well as increasing confidence of homebuilders," Ralph B. McLaughlin, chief economist at real estate listings website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, said in an email. “It is also a positive sign for the U.S. economy headed into 2016, as new-home sales lead to new construction and consumer demand for housing-related goods and services."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other economists pointed out that the latest rise in new-home sales likely reflects a shortage of previously owned homes on the market. Steady hiring across the U.S. has also positioned many Americans to buy after years of renting. And mortgage rates remain historically low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales are still weak historically despite the latest pickup.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other signs point to slow gains in the housing market. Sales of existing homes[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-tumble-in-february-1458569262]—roughly 90% of all home purchases—fell 7.1% in February from January, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said this week, but they were up 2.2% from the prior year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's report showed new-home inventory has expanded. Based on the current sales pace, it would take 5.6 months to exhaust the supply of newly built homes on the market. That matched January's supply and was above December's supply of 5.2 months. The total number of new homes for sale at the end of the month was 240,000, the highest level since October 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a new home—the point at which half of homes were sold above and half sold below—stood at $301,400 last month. That was up 2.6% from a year earlier. Price figures aren't adjusted for seasonal factors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales fell sharply in the Northeast and Midwest last month, declined modestly in the South, and climbed sharply in the West.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Peter Grant   </div><div>753 words</div><div>23 March 2016</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2016, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. commercial-real-estate sales plummeted in February, sending the clearest signal yet that a six-year bull market might be coming to an end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just $25.1 billion worth of office buildings, stores, apartment complexes and other commercial property changed hands last month, compared with $47.3 billion a year earlier, according to deal tracker <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics Inc</span>. In January, sales were $46.2 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices, which had been on a steady march higher since 2009, are beginning to plateau, and have started falling in certain sectors and geographies, according to analysts and market participants. An index of hotel values compiled by real-estate tracker <span class="companylink">Green Street Advisors</span>, for example, was 10% lower in February than a year earlier, due in part to reduced business and international travel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, commercial-property values are leveling off. Green Street's broad valuation index was 8.7% higher in February from a year earlier, but in the previous year the index rose 11%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Clearly there has been a plateauing," said Jonathan Gray, global head of real estate for <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span>, the world's largest private-property owner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question is whether February was a temporary blip or the beginning of a more-lasting pullback. The Green Street index, which tracks higher-quality property owned by real-estate investment trusts, is 24% above its 2007 peak and 102% higher than the trough it hit in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gray and others emphasize that the commercial-property market is much healthier than before the 2008 crash. Rents, occupancies and other fundamental factors are improving for most property types, analysts say. New supply growth has been limited, they point out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's too early to call the end of the cycle," Mr. Gray said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some are heading for the exit. For example, Radnor, Pa.-based <span class="companylink">Brandywine Realty Trust</span> has sold $765 million worth of property this year, including Cira Square, the former U.S. Post Office Building in Philadelphia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gerard Sweeney, Brandywine's chief executive, said the real-estate investment trust is "accelerating" its property sales. "We've made the call that, given where we are in the real-estate cycle, now is a good time for us to be harvesting value by selling," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market has slowed primarily because of forces at work in the global capital markets rather than problems stemming from real estate itself. These forces, which also caused global stock markets to plummet in the first two months of this year, have made debt -- the lifeblood of real estate -- more expensive and more difficult to obtain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most striking sign has been the sharp decline in bonds backed by commercial mortgages. In 2015, about $100 billion of commercial mortgage-backed securities were issued. This year experts believe volume will fall to $60 billion to $75 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks and insurance companies are filling part of the void. But they can charge more and be more selective, making loans primarily backed by trophy and fully leased buildings in strong markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are deals falling out of the system," said Josh Zegen, managing principal of Madison Realty Capital, an investment firm with more than $1 billion of loans outstanding. "I'm able to be very choosy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real-estate debt markets began to tighten at the end of last year as concerns grew about interest rates rising and new regulations on lenders, enacted in response to the world financial downturn, began to take effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Central banks eased up on their tightening of interest rates, but the real-estate debt market remained choppy at the beginning of the year as global stock and corporate-bond markets convulsed amid signs the Chinese economy was weakening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As yields of junk bonds soared, real estate became a less attractive investment. At the same time, the spreads between real-estate borrowing rates and <span class="companylink">Treasury</span> bonds widened greatly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today loans that would have been made with interest rates in the 4.5%-to-5% range now are being made above 5%. Borrowers who would have lent up to 75% of a property's value have reduced their so-called loan-to-value ratios to between 65% and 70%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those changes mean that many real-estate investments that would have made sense before no longer do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Buyers have been hearing 'no' from lenders for the first time in a while," said Jim Costello, senior vice president at Real Capital Analytics.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fashion designer Max Azria is relisting his Los Angeles mansion with a higher price tag: $88 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Azria put the 17-bedroom home on the market for $85 million in April[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/fashion-designer-max-azria-is-listing-los-angeles-mansion-for-85-million-1427408377] of last year with the Agency, but it was taken off the market about eight months later after failing to sell. It is now coming back on the market with Alla Furman and Branden and Rayni Williams of Hilton &amp; Hyland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Furman said the higher price is warranted because prices of high-end Los Angeles homes are increasing. The new agents have already filmed a video at the house to help sell it, hiring actors to play a family who lives there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Designed by architect Paul Revere Williams in the 1930s, the property has about 30,000 square feet of living space. In the two-story home's entryway, a floor-to-ceiling waterfall chandelier is made from over 150,000 crystals. A home theater has a candy and popcorn bar, and Mr. Azria's office has a domed, gold-leaf ceiling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nearly 3-acre property has a swimming pool with a bar and a Moroccan-themed pool house with a sauna, spa and fireplace. A tennis court has an elevated viewing box. A glass-ceilinged greenhouse has been converted into a gym, and there is a second greenhouse for organic produce.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The widening gap between the middle and upper tiers of home prices is making it harder for people to trade up, tightening inventories and pressuring prices, according to a study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The analysis, by real estate tracker <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, found that fewer midrange, or trade-up, homes came onto the market over the past four years in metro areas where prices of high-end homes rose the most.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Midrange homeowners are less likely to try to sell if premium homes are out of their reach. That reduces inventory of such homes, leading to sales stagnation and higher prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People may be in a good spot to sell their homes, but if they can't find another home to buy they're going to be more likely to stay put," said Ralph McLaughlin, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>'s chief economist. "It's really a gridlock, a traffic jam that's playing out in the housing market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Trulia</span> divides the entire stock of single-family homes and condominiums in a metropolitan area into three tiers: starter, trade-up and premium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the top 100 U.S. metro areas, the study found a high correlation between lower inventory of trade-up homes and the price gap between these homes and premium ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lower supply of trade-up homes affects prospective buyers down the chain, Mr. McLaughlin said. Those living in starter homes have to compete more aggressively for fewer midtier homes, meaning some of those homeowners may also stay put.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto   </div><div>1411 words</div><div>21 March 2016</div><div>16:11</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street firms have found a new way to profit from consumers with blemished credit who can't qualify for a mortgage: let them rent a home first with the option to buy it later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rent-to-own programs, once run mainly by small operators, were popular with cash-strapped consumers during the 1990s. They faded a decade later when easy lending made it possible for almost anyone to buy a home with no money down, but with lenders setting a higher bar, they are making a comeback.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For investors, it is a chance to profit off the recovering housing market. Consumers get a chance to lock in a home before they have the money together for a down payment. But the price may be higher rent in the interim and a higher purchase price the longer they wait to move from renting to owning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the fastest-growing rent-to-own companies is Home Partners of America, which was co-founded three years ago by former <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> executive William Young. Mortgage securities veteran Lewis Ranieri was an early investor in the company, and real-estate mogul Sam Zell has acted as an adviser to Mr. Young. Late last year, Home Partners received a $500 million equity investment from a group led by money manager BlackRock Inc.'s alternative investments arm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Young, who formerly co-headed <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>'s European mortgage department, said he saw an untapped market helping people who are being shut out of the housing market.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What really frustrates me personally is that a lot of people I grew up with, extended family members, would have trouble getting access to mortgage credit today," said Mr. Young. He says his company spent $100 million to buy about 320 homes in June, up from $15 million, or 66 homes, in June of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Stern, a managing director at BlackRock, said he sees Home Partners as a long-term, sustainable business. Mr. Ranieri said the program is both viable and needed given tightness of mortgage credit and the lack of readily available solutions. Mr. Zell declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's how Home Partners' program works. A consumer teams up with a real-estate agent to select a home in one of Home Partners' approved communities, which tend to be suburban locations with strong school systems and with homes priced between $100,000 and about $725,000. Home Partners buys the home and leases it to the consumer, who has the right to purchase the home from Home Partners within five years in most places. During the renting years, the consumer is expected to repair his or her credit and save for a down payment, but the longer they rent the more they will pay to acquire the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, a house shown on Home Partners website has a list price of $449,975 in Chula Vista, Calif. The family that agrees to rent that house from Home Partners has the right to purchase the home for $472,035 after one year and would have to pay $573,762 if it waited five years before purchasing, a markup of 28% from the initial list price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The monthly rent on the property would start at $2,810 a month and escalate to $3,256 in the fifth year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For consumers, that likely means that they are paying a premium over renting or buying a typical home. Monthly payments on a 30-year conventional mortgage on the same house would be around $1,800. The average rent for a single-family home in San Diego is $2,270 a month, according to Moody's Analytics—although typical single-family rentals are likely smaller and in less desirable areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home Partners officials say that the increases are in line with the rapid rise in home prices in markets such as California and rents are typically within 5% to 10% of comparable properties in the market. The S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index, covering the entire nation, rose 4.4% in the 12 months ended in May, slightly greater than a 4.3% increase in April. Home prices in San Diego climbed 4.8% year-over-year in May 2015, according to the index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home Partners also notes that the consumer can decide not to purchase if the home is more expensive than comparable properties in the area. If price growth slows and the consumer thinks buying a home is a bad deal, they can walk away with no penalty and Home Partners would re-rent the home. The company says that they expect about half of their renters to ultimately purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tiffany Morgan, who works in marketing in Sugarland, Texas, turned to Home Partners 2013 after a divorce destroyed her credit. When she first heard about the program, she thought it was a scam. “I thought no way...it's some scheme that I'm going to fall into," said Ms. Morgan, who is in her mid-30s with a 7-year-old son.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home Partners purchased the home for around $205,000 and she rented it for about a year for $1,730 a month. That same year she improved her credit and bought the house for $215,000. She thought, “What's the worst case? I'll lease it for a while and then if I fall in love with it I'll do what I need to do to make it happen."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For consumers, the advantage is that the homes tend to be in nicer neighborhoods with better school districts than most single-family rental properties. It also guarantees that if house prices escalate faster than that, the price is guaranteed when they go to purchase the home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Sarah Edelman, a senior policy analyst at the <span class="companylink">Center for American Progress</span>, a Washington-based nonpartisan policy institute, said that it is early to tell if Home Partners' rent and home price bumps will prove to be in line with the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“All things equal this could be a really great opportunity for consumers," she said, referring to the cost of Home Partners program versus the rest of the market. “But all things need to be equal."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, Home Partners operates only in 30 metropolitan areas in 15 states, including California, Florida and Texas. It currently doesn't operate in the Northeast. But Home Partners is teaming up with Berkshire Hathaway Home Services and Realogy Holdings Corp., which operates several real-estate brokerage franchises including Century 21 and <span class="companylink">Coldwell Banker</span>, which will give it national reach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A motivating factor for home buyers to use a rent-to-own program is the combination of government policies and banks' increased cautiousness have made mortgages much more difficult to get, even for middle-class Americans. Buyers typically must have higher credit scores than were needed even in the early 2000s, before the subprime boom. The homeownership rate for middle-income Americans has fallen to 63% from 69% in 2000, according to Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home Partners isn't alone in seeing a profitable niche in the rent-to-own space. New York City-based HomeLPC, started by a former Lehman Brothers banker, launched about a year ago and has expanded to three states, where it has bought two dozen homes. It plans to expand into five more states by the first quarter of 2016. Premium Point Investments, a New York-based asset manager, is in the midst of testing a rent-to-own business focused on the South and Southeast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether rent-to-own will prove to be profitable remains to be seen. A number of companies that rent out single-family homes have found that few renters have become buyers, either because they haven't been able to restore their credit or haven't been able to save enough for a down payment. But Home Partners said its credit screening targets middle-class and affluent clients who have steady jobs and an overall financial history that makes it likely they will be able to repair their credit and save money for a down payment within a few years.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market has a supply issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between low interest rates, a steady job market and rising rents, economic fundamentals suggest lots of houses should be selling. Simultaneously, though, tight inventory levels are playing a role in driving prices higher, making the market less appealing for buyers and potentially making it tougher for sales to keep growing at a rapid clip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the spring selling season ramps into gear, Monday's report on existing-home sales should offer clues of whether higher prices are keeping potential buyers on the sidelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal estimate February sales of previously owned homes fell 2.6% from a month earlier. On a year-over-year basis, sales are expected to have risen 7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2015, existing-home sales had their best year since 2006. But falling inventory could make it difficult for last year's strength to continue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, there were about 1.8 million existing homes available for sale at the end of January, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. That was down 2.2% from a year earlier. It also represented about a four-month level of supply at the current sales pace, near the lowest levels since 2005. A level of six months is considered typical.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, as economists at <span class="companylink">Capital Economics</span> point out, tight inventory of existing homes presents an opportunity for home builders to break ground on more new houses. Home builders and home-improvement retailers stand to benefit in this environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, the existing-home market isn't completely dried up. As the Journal reported earlier this month, housing has become a tale of two markets, as lower-priced homes have been selling rapidly while inventory of more expensive ones is piling up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the near term, stock-market volatility and weakening consumer sentiment could take a toll on home sales. But in the longer term, housing bulls should keep close tabs on inventory as a key to the market's sustained success.</p>

<span class="companylink">Trulia</span> divides the entire stock of single-family homes and condominiums in a metropolitan area into three tiers: starter, trade-up and premium. Starter homes are defined as those in the bottom third of the distribution, with a median national price of $154,156, while trade-up homes have a median price of $267,845 and premium homes are priced at a median of $542,805. The median prices for each tier can vary widely across metro areas.
            </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the top 100 metro areas across the country, the study found a high correlation between the lower inventory of midrange homes and the price gap between trade-up homes and premium homes.
            </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, in Orange County, Calif., the price difference between a median trade-up and premium home in early 2012 was $421,938. That gap jumped to $664,000 by this year—a 57% increase. The inventory of trade-up homes in the area fell by nearly 70% over the last four years.
            </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Little Rock, Ark., by contrast, the divide between trade-up and premium homes increased only 9.5% between early 2012 and this year. The inventory of midtier homes fell by just 7.7% over that time period.
            
            </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lower supply of trade-up homes affects prospective buyers down the chain, Mr. McLaughlin said. Those who live in starter homes have to compete more for fewer midtier homes, meaning some of those homeowners may also stay put.
            </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the U.S., <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> found the inventory of starter homes has decreased the most—by 43.6%—over the last four years, followed by trade-up homes, at 41%, and premium homes at 33.4%.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amy LaBorde has seen all sides of the inventory crunch, both as a homeowner and real-estate agent in the Denver area.

            </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. LaBorde and her fiancé were looking to trade up to a larger home in Boulder, Colo., and were outbid several times, including once by nearly $100,000. So they have decided to stay put in their Denver home until the market evens out.
            </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's just not a great time to buy because of the competition," Ms. LaBorde said. “A lot of people are just sitting there waiting, because what they're looking for doesn't exist in their price range any more."

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-building in the U.S. rebounded in February, reaching its highest level since September amid strong demand for housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists noted that warm February weather may have led to higher-than-usual building activity, after housing starts fell in January and December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities, said the low inventory of existing homes should support home-building going forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The most important fundamental in the housing market is a shortfall of supply relative to demand and there is only one way to fix that problem: more building," he said in a note to clients. “Industry sources suggest that this is finally beginning to happen."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But new applications for building permits, a bellwether for forthcoming construction, fell the same month, possibly portending fewer housing starts in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“For now, we can't get too excited about a one-month overshoot in starts," said Ian Shepherdson, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Housing starts rose 5.2% from a month earlier[http://www.census.gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf] to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.178 million in February, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starts on single-family homes, which account for roughly two-thirds of the market, rose 7.2% in February to 822,000, their highest level since November 2007. Permits for single-family homes rose 0.4% to 731,000, the second-highest level since the end of December 2007. Single-family homes are considered a more reliable barometer of the housing market, as construction of multifamily units is more volatile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Multifamily units, which include apartments and condominiums, rose 0.8% to 356,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Terry Russell, chief executive of FrontDoor Communities, which operates in the southeast, said new construction so far this year for his company is up 30% compared with last year. The company is on track to build 240 homes this year in the region, up from about 170 last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Russell said the hot market for existing homes, particularly in parts of the Atlanta area, has given him the confidence to start building homes even when the prospective purchasers haven't sold their previous homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not unusual for there to be multiple bidders on their homes," said Mr. Russell, who builds in Atlanta, Charleston, S.C. and Naples, Fla. “So we'll take a contingent contract. We'll go ahead and get it started."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But new applications for building permits fell 3.1% to 1.167 million, from a revised January rate of 1.204 million, driven by a 8.4% fall in multifamily units. Some of that slowdown could be due to rising prices for land; home builders have been reporting shortages of land and labor for months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Johnston, chief operating officer of Mattamy Homes, which operates in four U.S. states and Canada, said his company has slowed the pace of land purchasing because prices have gotten so high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are more builders out there and everyone is feeling more positive," Mr. Johnston said. “They see their land supply diminishing, and they're getting into the market to replace it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, a gauge of home builder sentiment held at its lowest level since May[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-nahb-housing-index-holds-at-58-in-march-1458050403], the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-starts figures are volatile and often revised. Wednesday's report showed new-home starts revised up to 1.120 million in January, compared with an initial estimate of 1.099 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists took the drop in permits, alongside other recent housing data, as a sign that housing momentum was slowing in 2016 after a robust 2015 showing in which housing contributed more than a quarter of a percentage point to GDP growth over the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"New home sales, permits, and the <span class="companylink">NAHB</span> Housing Market Index point to little upward impetus in single family starts over the near term, and we therefore would caution against extrapolating the gain reported today for February," said Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist at MFR, Inc., in an analyst note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for housing has been strong over the past year. Housing starts in February were 30.9% higher than in February a year ago, and permits were up 6.3% from a year ago. Historically low interest rates and ongoing job creation should continue to lend the housing market support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But across the country, prices have climbed in many markets amid short supply, and construction levels for new homes remain historically low. The number of existing homes tentatively sold across the U.S. fell[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-pending-home-sales-tumbled-2-5-in-january-1456758035] in January, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said late last month. The Commerce Department also reported a drop in January's sales of newly built homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales ticked up slightly in January[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-rise-0-4-in-january-1456240620], the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said last month, but the supply of homes is dwindling and prices have been rising. In many areas, home-price gains are outpacing wage increases, making it harder for people to save for a down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales figures for February will be released March 21, and February new-home sales figures will be out on March 23.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A number of key indicators due this week will offer more insight on the health of the Canadian economy. In addition, Canada's prime minister will travel to the U.S. again, this time to meet with United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The week begins with a read on the housing sector, with existing home sales data for February due Tuesday morning. Housing markets in Vancouver and Toronto have been running full steam ahead despite economic headwinds caused by slumping oil prices. The figures are closely watched for any signs of trouble, but the <span class="companylink">Canadian Real Estate Association</span> has continued to say the housing market remains balanced overall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will be in New York City on Wednesday and Thursday to meet the head of the <span class="companylink">UN</span> and to receive a special commendation from Catalyst, a group focused on promoting advancement for women in the workplace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Statistics Canada will release January manufacturing sales data on Wednesday. Economists with <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Canada</span> said they expect sales to show continued growth in January, rising an estimated 0.5% on gains in auto production. Manufacturing sales were up 1.2% in the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday is the most important day for economic data this week, with the release of retail sales and inflation data. <span class="companylink">BMO Capital Markets</span> sees retail sales rising 0.4% in January, retracing some of the 2.2% decline in the previous month, while CIBC World Markets is forecasting a 0.1% decline on softer gasoline prices and reduced auto spending. Consumer prices are expected to rise 0.4% in February from the previous month, according to <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Canada</span>. Seasonal increases in clothing, travel services and auto prices could put upward pressure on inflation, the firm suggests, along with the earlier weakening of the Canadian dollar.</p>

China Vanke 2015 Net Profit Up 15.1% on Stronger Sales; Home builder benefits from Beijing’s policy moves</span>
</div><div class="author">By Esther Fung   </div><div>266 words</div><div>13 March 2016</div><div>08:57</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHANGHAI—<span class="companylink">China Vanke Co</span>., the world's largest home builder by revenue, reported stronger earnings last year after the Chinese government loosened administrative curbs and monetary policy to encourage housing sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Shenzhen-based developer said Sunday its 2015 net profit attributable to shareholders rose 15.1% to 18.1 billion yuan ($2.78 billion). Revenue rose 33.6% to 184.3 billion yuan, Vanke, which is listed in both Shenzhen and Hong Kong, said in a stock-exchange announcement</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Urbanization in China is far from over," said Vanke, adding that the property market is still in its “silver age." Vanke famously said in 2013 that the “golden age" of China's property market had ended and it had entered a “silver age."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We saw a general rebound in the transaction amount in major cities in 2015; we saw rapid upsurge in property prices in certain cities, and we even saw land price in individual cities rise to an astounding level," the statement said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Yet we should not neglect the fact that many more cities were still in the process of clearing their dwelling stock," Vanke said, referring to high property inventory levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's policy makers have lowered interest rates and removed home-purchase restrictions in most cities in the past year amid concerns that a persistent downturn in the housing market would lead to a hard landing for the broader economy.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Joe Light   </div><div>978 words</div><div>10 March 2016</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Europe Edition)</div><div>WSJE</div><div>A7</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2016, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A two-bedroom house in Los Angeles listed for $585,000 received 10 offers in the first week it hit the market, with the winner agreeing to pay $640,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, a four-bedroom house a few miles away, priced at $3 million, sat on the market for more than a month with no offers before selling for $2.75 million in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The divide in Los Angeles is typical of what is happening across the nation. Housing has become a tale of two markets, brokers and economists said, with lower-price homes selling quickly even as inventory of expensive ones piles up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Nationwide</span>, the number of homes for sale priced below $100,000 fell 8.6% in January from a year earlier, while the number of homes above $1 million rose 15%, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. Price bands in between those levels show a similar trend: The lower the price, the smaller the growth in the number of homes on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists cite a number of factors. On the low end, after a slow recovery from the housing bust, first-time buyers are finally returning to the market, bolstered by still-cheap mortgages. But after years of little new construction, inventory is still tight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High-end buyers, meanwhile, are more sensitive to stock-market struggles this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In certain price points, it's really tough for buyers right now. There's limited inventory and lots of demand," said Los Angeles real-estate agent Alec Traub. But for high-price homes, Mr. Traub said, "things may be sitting on the market a little longer."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At January's sales pace, it would take about four months to exhaust the supply of existing homes for sale, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>, compared with 4 1/2 months in January 2015. About six months is considered a balanced market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Cospito, 58 years old, plans to close on a newly built condominium in Naples, Fla., in mid-April. In October, he visited the wealthy city for the first time, and before the trip was over, he paid asking price for a $240,000 condominium in a building now under construction. That is below Naples's median price of $340,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When we visited, there were people in the sales office with checkbooks. They were buying," said Mr. Cospito. "I did feel a little bit pressured." Mr. Cospito said he received an email three weeks later saying the condominium project had sold out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, Brendan Duffy, Mr. Cospito's real-estate agent, said buyers in Naples willing to pay more than $2 million have much more to choose from than they did a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's so much coming out of the ground in those higher price ranges," Mr. Duffy said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the <span class="companylink">Naples Area Board of Realtors</span>, while the number of homes for sale priced below $300,000 fell 9% between January 2015 and January 2016, the number of homes for sale listed above $300,000 rose 23%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix real-estate agent Cami Elliott said one buyer she recently worked with who wanted a home for about $750,000 had more than 45 potential homes to look at. If that buyer were looking for a home priced closer to $400,000, she said there would only be three or four.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While rising prices typically draw more home sellers and builders to the market, that trend has been slow for low-price homes. According to real-estate broker Redfin, prices in the bottom third of homes rose 38% between 2012 and 2015, while the number of homes for sale fell 39%. For the upper third of homes, prices rose 23%, while inventory jumped 36%. "It feels like the laws of supply and demand are broken," said Redfin Chief Executive Glenn Kelman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some low-price homes on the market have been foreclosed on, have been vacant and need extensive work, driving potential buyers to the even smaller subset of homes that are ready to live in, said Sam Khater, an economist for <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the percentage of homes sold within 30 days is back to its housing-boom peak, Mr. Khater said, the percentage that has been on the market for more than six months is eight points higher than in the boom years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders' reluctance to tackle the entry-level market hasn't helped. In 2015, the average home size rose to 2,720 square feet, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>, from 2,660 square feet in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tim Lewis, a luxury-home builder in Northern California and Nevada, said he has seen sales slow for homes priced above $500,000 and is starting to search for lots on which he can build cheaper homes. He said buyers in expensive communities are still coming in to look but are more hesitant to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're more conservative. They wonder if we're entering a recession," Mr. Lewis said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The few large builders, like <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton Inc</span>., that have tackled the starter-home market are seeing success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Certainly, the entry level of the market is the strongest right now, and any time we see that in the market, we expect further competition," D.R. Horton Chief Operating Officer Michael Murray told analysts earlier this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barclays analyst Stephen Kim said other large builders have so far been content watching and waiting but that, as the luxury-home market stalls, more will be driven to construct cheaper homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you continue to see first-time home buying grow faster than the industry overall, it will happen," Mr. Kim said. "It's only a matter of time."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Office of Financial Research said the ripple effects from a large bank default could be nine times larger across the banking sector than what is contemplated under existing "stress tests" of individual firms.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The OFR said ignoring the second-order effects would be unwise and said its finding "informs the evaluation of stress tests" because "by considering the banking system as a whole, they highlight a macro-prudential perspective on stress testing."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Art Patnaude   </div><div>550 words</div><div>9 March 2016</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Europe Edition)</div><div>WSJE</div><div>B6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2016, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">International investors are piling into U.K. student housing, with a flurry of deals showing renewed interest in this small corner of the property market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greystar Real Estate Partners of the U.S. has agreed to buy a student-housing portfolio for about GBP 600 million ($856 million) from U.K. private-equity group Round Hill Capital LLC, a person familiar with the deal said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the <span class="companylink">Canada Pension Plan Investment Board</span> spent GBP 1.1 billion to acquire the U.K.'s <span class="companylink">Liberty</span> Living, while a company headed by Russian oligarch Mikhail Fridman paid GBP 532 million for another London student-housing portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yields on office buildings and other traditional property types have fallen as investors flush with cash and able to borrow at low rates have pushed prices higher. That has some investors looking elsewhere for higher returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traditionally, real-estate investing "has been focused around the main commercial property types of retail, office, and industrial," a February report from the Investment Property Forum, a U.K. industry body, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But investors' hunt for higher long-term returns is producing "significant changes in the market," said Jon Neale, head of U.K. research at broker JLL. The fastest-growing sectors are now those deemed "alternatives" -- like student-housing, hotels, health care and privately rented residential real estate -- GBP 11.6 billion of which traded in 2014, a 33% increase from 2013, JLL figures show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It remains a small part of the GBP 65 billion of U.K. real estate traded last year, but alternatives "accounted for only a few percentage points of volumes just a few years ago," Mr. Neale said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For U.K. student accommodation, the average investment yield has been 5.8% this year, compared with 5.1% on offices, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span> data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The yield on student housing is down from 6.4% last year, a reflection of rising prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were about $2.4 billion of student housing transactions in the U.K. in 2014, down 18% from 2013, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>. U.S. firms Greystar, LaSalle Investment and Goldman Sachs have been among the biggest buyers in the last two years, the data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last Friday, the Canadian Pension Plan bought 16,700 student rooms in more than 40 residences across 17 cities -- as well as the company that manages the business -- from the Brandeaux Student Accommodation Fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was the Canadian investor's largest-ever real-estate deal in Europe, and its first there in the alternative space, said Andrea Orlandi, head of European real-estate investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For CPP, student accommodation provides "a noticeable pickup in the yield" offered by office investments, Mr. Orlandi said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The opportunity to buy the management company and its team means, "we can look to buy more assets" in a sector "that can, and will, consolidate in the future," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Greystar deal Monday, Round Hill is selling three London residences with 2,375 beds, a portfolio it bought for $415 million from <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span> in 2012. Round Hill will retain the student-housing brand Nido, its management business and one student residence in London it bought earlier this year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices and rents are surging in Denver, but local builder Jared Phifer said his construction work virtually ground to a halt last fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reason: He can't get permits for new projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The process can take as long as eight months, at which point the prices he quoted buyers often are out of date, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The delays are "almost making us go bankrupt," he said. "We've had to put a halt on so many projects that I'm in the process of getting a loan for $150,000 to cover all of our expenses."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City governments across the U.S. cut back on employees during the recession. Now, with the memory of the bust still fresh, they remain reluctant to add staff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When we went through the recession, a lot of cities laid staff off and now we're back into a semi-booming economy and they've been slow to staff up," said Paul Zucker, president of <span class="companylink">Zucker Systems</span>, which consults with cities around the country about how to improve their permitting processes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The manpower shortage has increased the time it takes for builders to get permits and other approvals. Developers of single-family homes reported that the median delay was seven months in 2015, compared with four months in 2011, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bradley Gaskins, chairman of the codes and standards committee of the American Institute of Architects, said the group's members are seeing permit approvals take six to eight months in hot markets such as Florida and California, versus the typical two to three months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The delays come as housing affordability is a growing challenge in many cities around the U.S. Over the past five years, rents have risen 20%, according to data provider <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>., and home prices have risen 25%, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers are expected to build almost one million apartments in the U.S. over the next three years, according to Axiometrics Inc. The projects are becoming a bottleneck for municipalities, however, because they are more complex and usually take longer to approve. That, in turn, holds up permit applications for smaller projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides restricting housing supply, the delays can cost developers thousands of dollars in employee salaries, interest on loans and other items. In the end, Mr. Gaskins said, "it increases the costs to the consumers because ultimately all the costs are passed onto us."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some municipalities are trying to strike a balance between hiring enough staff to get to the bottom of a growing pile of permit applications and not being overstaffed when the next downturn hits. In Nashville, Tenn., Terry Cobb, director of the Department of Codes and Building Safety, expects to process permits for nearly $3.6 billion of construction in the fiscal year ending this June, up from the previous record of $2.4 billion set in the prior fiscal year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Delays are increasing. John Tirrill, a partner at SWH Residential Partners, said it took six months for him to receive the permits for a 247-unit luxury apartment project, River House, in downtown Nashville. Mr. Tirrill said the firm broke ground on the project in September, even though it hadn't received the permit until this February. This was a risky move because he couldn't lock down the total cost of construction and labor without a building permit in hand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cobb said his department employs about 100 people, about the same as when he started 26 years ago. It can get by on a lean staff thanks in part to technological innovation, although its 10-year-old computer system is outdated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are always conscious of not overstaffing," said Mr. Cobb. "During recession years we tend to lose positions. Then to have this immediate turnaround -- we've been chasing it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Denver, home prices have shot up more than 40% over the past four years, according to Case-Shiller, while rents have jumped 25%, according to Reis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing supply is growing as well. Building officials said they might process permits for more than $3 billion of construction in 2015, better than the record $2.6 billion in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the building department has struggled to keep pace with the supply growth. Last July, Denver saw the biggest permit backlog in its history, according to Brad Buchanan, the executive director of community planning and development. Residential projects were taking as long as three months to review, three times the target duration. Apartment and office projects were taking two months to review, although some developers and homeowners reported waiting much longer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Last summer our phones were ringing off the wall with people who couldn't even get permits to change out water heaters," said Jeff Whiton, chief executive officer of the Home Builders Association of Metropolitan Denver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Buchanan said the department has made a number of changes, including adopting a new software system and hiring additional staff and outsourcing some reviews to a third-party firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, he said, residential projects are being processed within a month, while most apartment and office projects are on time and those that are late are running 12 days behind schedule, on average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We saw this increase coming," he said. "We did not see it coming to the extent that it came."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Koch Seeks $80 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Billionaire industrialist William Koch is cutting his Aspen estate by $20 million, bringing the price tag to $80 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most recently listed at $100 million with another firm, the property sits on roughly 83 acres about 10 miles from downtown Aspen, according to listing firm <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</span>. The eight-bedroom house measures roughly 15,000 square feet. Its features include temperature-controlled wine storage (Mr. Koch is a wine collector) and a home theater that doubles as an altitude acclimation room. The asking price includes the furniture but not Mr. Koch's art collection, said Joshua Saslove, who is listing the property with Raifie Bass and Wendy Wogan, also of <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property also includes three other parcels with houses on them. The largest, on roughly 22 acres, has an entertainment hall and an indoor basketball court. A roughly 7-acre parcel includes a roughly 4,200-square-foot house. A third house, on 1 1/2 acres, measures about 2,600 square feet. The parcels can be sold separately, Mr. Saslove said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Koch is the founder of Oxbow and the brother of conservative political donors Charles and David Koch. He couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Royal Home</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lists in Miami</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Mediterranean Revival-style estate in Miami Beach, Fla., formerly owned by Saudi royalty, is expected to list for $24.995 million, according to listing agent Dora Puig of Luxe Living Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On man-made Palm Island, the property has 225 feet of water frontage overlooking Biscayne Bay. The home is about 9,300 square feet. The property also has a guesthouse, a putting green, a bocce court, a movie theater and game room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seller is Thomas Sullivan, founder of <span class="companylink">Lumber Liquidators</span> and Cabinets to Go. He purchased the home in 2008 for $11 million from a corporation represented by Saudi Prince Mohammed Bin Faisal Bin Turki Bin Abdulaziz, according to county filings. The prince didn't respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sullivan said he is selling because he is looking to renovate another home in the area.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big Price Tag In Silicon Valley</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An elaborate Italian-style spec home in Silicon Valley is asking $42.8 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the affluent town of Atherton, Calif., the 1.45 acre-property has a 16,468-square-foot, six-bedroom main house and a one-bedroom guesthouse. Between them is a fire pit and an outdoor kitchen with a wood-burning pizza oven, a wok burner and a dual-tap keg dispenser. There is also a freshwater pool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to developer Rafi Bamdad, the home has six hand-carved French limestone fireplaces as well as 15 security cameras. The "man cave" or office has a bar, a bath, a television and room for a conference table. The lower level of the home includes a whiskey bar and a 3,000-bottle wine cellar. There is also a gym and an 11-seat theater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bamdad said he and Kathy Nabavi, his wife and business partner, paid $7.25 million in 2013 for the lot and a ranch-style home that they tore down. The median sales price for a home in Atherton was $4.8 million for the period Nov. 25 to Feb. 24, up 8% from the previous year, according to real-estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mary Gullixson and Brent Gullixson of Alain Pinel Realtors share the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Sarah Tilton</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Miami Spec Home Cuts Price</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A newly built Miami Beach house has shaved $5 million off its asking price, as competition among high-end spec homes in the area increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The roughly 13,500-square-foot waterfront house at 5446 North Bay Rd. is now listed with Brett Harris of Douglas Elliman Real Estate for $32 million, after listing for $37 million in 2014. The property also had gone on the market in 2013, during construction, for $32 million. The developers, Todd Michael Glaser and the Posner Group, sold another Miami Beach spec home in December for $19.48 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developers bought the roughly 31,000-square-foot site in 2012 for $9.6 million, according to public records. They then demolished the home and built a new house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home has a gym, an elevator and a rooftop terrace. Outside, a pool about 70 feet long and a hot tub overlook the bay. The lot also includes a one-bedroom guesthouse. A dock can fit a boat more than 100 feet long. There are also three koi ponds stocked with fish. The house is being sold fully furnished.</p>

</div><div class="author">By M.K. Quinlan   </div><div>1258 words</div><div>3 March 2016</div><div>10:12</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Birmingham, Alabama's largest city, lost more than 50,000 jobs after the 2008 real-estate crash. Fifteen years ago, at least 30 publicly traded companies were headquartered there; now there are only 12. And Jefferson County, where Birmingham resides, filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/SB10001424052970204224604577028491526654090] in 2011, exiting in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, Birmingham is making a comeback—which for luxury home buyers means the return of bidding wars, lengthy home searches and rising prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matthew Conroy, his wife, Alexee, and their children moved from Brooklyn, N.Y., to Birmingham in 2013 when he took a job as CFO of Momentum Telecom, a cloud-based communications provider. Initially the couple moved in with Mrs. Conroy's parents for what they thought would be a couple months of house hunting. It wound up taking them a year. “A lot of people are just forcing through pocket deals," Mr. Conroy said, referring to homes listed and sold privately [http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/real-estate-pocket-listings-go-mainstream-1443115265]or through word-of-mouth. “The number of friends that I have—executives—who are literally walking around putting notes on people's doors and baking cookies for people. It's craziness. There's just not a lot of inventory."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conroys' first offers on three separate homes were all rejected in bidding wars. So when a charming 1940s cottage came on the market, meticulously renovated by a well-known interior designer, the couple made an offer above asking price the same day it was listed. “A lot of the homes we had seen hadn't been renovated in 30 years, or were renovated piecemeal," said Mr. Conroy. “This was a house that we could see ourselves in for a really long time. And it was in a style and had a level of artistry that we really loved."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They paid $869,900 for the three-bedroom, 2½-bathroom house, which is less than a quarter-mile from Mountain Brook Village, an upscale shopping area in the city of Mountain Brook, one of Greater Birmingham's high-end municipalities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That the couple would be happy in a 2,460-square-foot home—significantly smaller than other homes they'd toured—surprised family and friends. But the Conroys weren't alone in their sacrifice of quantity for quality square footage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Younger buyers aren't really interested in buying the biggest house their money can buy," said Brian Boehm, an agent with RealtySouth. “They want economical living that's not overblown." This trend means many of Birmingham's more formal estate homes, especially those listed at $2 million and up, are spending significantly more time on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Cooney, founder and former CEO of what is now CRC Insurance Services, and his wife, Liz, were eager to downsize and travel now that their children are grown. They have had their historic 2-acre estate in Mountain Brook on and off the market since 2012. The home includes four bedrooms, 5½ bathrooms, sprawling English gardens and a guesthouse. It's currently listed for $2.695 million, at least $1 million shy of what Mr. Cooney suspects he would have gotten at the market's peak in the mid-2000s. “The days of ‘I've got to have a big showcase piece of property to take care of my family and tell everyone I've arrived...I think it's less evident with kids now,'" said Mr. Cooney, who is 66. “They're more frugal."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While downtown Birmingham's luxury “rooftop residential" market—namely lofts and high-end condos—has been slow to take off, buyers' increasing interest in work-life balance (read: short commutes) has helped the city's perimeter neighborhoods—including the high-end and historic Forest Park, Redmont Park, Mountain Brook, and Homewood—claw back value since the pall of 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average sale price for homes $800,000 and up in Birmingham was just over $1.1 million in 2015, compared with $1.2 million in 2007, according to the Greater Alabama Multiple Listing Service. That gap might be bigger if not for a decrease in inventory, with 450 listings in 2015 compared with 639 in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I've got far more buyers on hand than sellers right now," said Mr. Boehm, the RealtySouth agent. “It's not uncommon in this market to see multiple offers pushing a sale above list price."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is especially true for renovated homes within walking distance of English Village, Crestline Village and Mountain Brook Village—popular areas with coffee shops, restaurants and luxury shopping, all a five- to 10-minute commute to the heart of downtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The trend of today is that everyone seems to want to be close in," said Stephanie Robinson, an agent with RealtySouth. “They want to walk to coffee, walk to dinner. They also want to be able to move their clothes and their furniture in and be done. There's only a certain amount of real estate that falls into that category."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those willing to live farther out are likely to find better deals, allowing them the budget for a big renovation. Sid Evans moved his family of four from Charleston, S.C., to Birmingham in 2011, where he oversees editorial for three <span class="companylink">Time Inc</span>. magazines. The house search took Mr. Evans, 46, and his wife, Susan, 43, over a year. “It was hard to find a good fit," Mr. Evans said. “Part of that is because we were being picky, and part of it is because the good homes go quickly."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple lost out on one home after a bidding war. “It dawned on us that we were going to have to renovate to get what we wanted," said Mr. Evans. “We weren't finding that turnkey home."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They eventually settled on a 2,885-square-foot, 1950s farm-style home located on 3½ acres. They purchased the home for $690,000 and spent eight months renovating. They gutted the original home and added another 1,475 square feet that includes an open-concept kitchen/family room as well as a heated pool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I never anticipated moving to Birmingham," said Mrs. Evans, a former attorney who is a stay-at-home mom. “But in the four-plus years since we've been here, we've seen Birmingham evolve…It's a rising city."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past two years, British-based Oxford Pharmaceuticals, as well as Steris, a global health-care company, and <span class="companylink">Evonik Industries</span>, a specialty chemicals company, have all selected Birmingham for the development of new campuses, drawn by the infrastructure of UAB Hospital, the third-largest public hospital in the U.S. and Birmingham's biggest employer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2015, developers spent $725 million on projects and planning in the city's downtown, according to the <span class="companylink">Birmingham Business Alliance</span>. Industrial mills, left empty as the city's steel and iron industries have waned, as well as the once tony Pizitz department store, are being converted for office, retail and residential use. Approximately 2,000 new apartments are currently under construction, as well as downtown's first full-scale grocery store and pharmacy since the 1960s, a <span class="companylink">Publix</span> set to open in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The financial crisis of 2008 wreaked havoc on Birmingham. We went through a period of diminished wealth," said Mr. Cooney. “The good news is you can't kill Birmingham. The magic of the city is still alive."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major U.S. stock indexes surged to their highest levels in nearly two months Tuesday on signs of improvement in the U.S. economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The broad rally was led by financial and technology shares, which fell sharply earlier this year as investors fretted about collateral damage from weak global growth, slumping corporate profits and low oil prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A handful of data across several sectors helped restore some confidence in the U.S. economy Tuesday, analysts and investors said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A gauge of the troubled manufacturing sector[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/manufacturing-sector-show-signs-of-improvement-in-february-1456845493] rose last month to its best reading since September, U.S. auto sales climbed[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/fiat-chrysler-u-s-auto-sales-jump-12-1456837271] and U.S. construction spending rose in January. A rally in oil prices added to the updraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The real world is not as bad" as the market made it seem recently, said Jason Hans, a portfolio manager at BMO Global Asset Management. His team bought auto and industrial stocks on Tuesday, he said.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 348.58 points, or 2.1%, to 16865.08, while the S&amp;P 500 added 46.12 points, or 2.4%, to 1978.35. For both indexes, it was their highest closing levels since Jan. 6 and their biggest one-day gains since Jan. 29. The Nasdaq Composite rose 131.65 points, or 2.9%, to 4689.60, its largest gain since Aug. 26.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors sold assets perceived as havens, driving up the yield on the 10-year <span class="companylink">Treasury</span> note to 1.835%, its highest since Feb. 5[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-goverment-bonds-pull-back-on-manufacturing-data-1456847597], compared with 1.740% Monday. Gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,230.30 an ounce. The dollar gained 1.2% against Japan's yen to ¥114.00.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another reflection of the renewed optimism, expectations that the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> will raise interest rates later this year have increased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal-funds futures, used by investors and traders to place bets on central-bank policy, showed a 60% likelihood of a rate increase from the Fed at its December policy meeting, according to data from <span class="companylink">CME Group</span>. The probability was 12% a month ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial stocks rallied Tuesday, leading the S&amp;P 500 with a 3.5% gain. Rising interest rates should help banks because they tend to widen the difference between the interest that banks charge on loans and what they pay for deposits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span> was the biggest gainer in the Dow, rising $2.90, or 5.2%, to $59.20. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index of large U.S. commercial lenders rose 4.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, U.S. oil prices rose[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/oil-price-rises-on-change-in-global-outlook-1456828086] 1.9% to $34.40 a barrel, their highest settlement value since Jan. 5, after Russia's energy minister said a “critical mass" of oil-producing countries agreed to freeze oil output, state news agency TASS reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Tuesday's stock-market rally wasn't enough to quash the rocky start to 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. economic data “has been pretty darn good. I wouldn't necessarily say ‘strong,'" said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at <span class="companylink">Charles Schwab</span>. “The market can move up quite a bit before it goes positive for the year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P 500 and the Dow industrials are both down 3.2% so far in 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts and investors said the factors that unsettled the markets earlier this year haven't fully faded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's not going be a sharp rebound," said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones. “Investors should be prepared for a lot more volatility until a lot more of these concerns are resolved."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese manufacturing activity fell to its lowest level [http://blogs.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/chinarealtime/2016/03/01/economists-react-chinas-manufacturing-weakened-sharply-in-february/]in more than four years, data showed Tuesday, as the world's second-largest economy continues to struggle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, global stocks have steadied over the past few weeks. Analysts said recent improvements in U.S. economic data and hopes for fresh stimulus from the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> have boosted sentiment. “We're not in the same place we were in two months ago," said Thushka Maharaj, global strategist at <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Asset Management</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Stoxx Europe 600 rose 1.4% Tuesday. The Shanghai Composite Index rose 1.7% and Japan's Nikkei Stock Average added 0.4%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. stocks started the month with a broad rally, as upbeat economic data helped calm fears of a slowdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data showed an uptick in U.S. auto sales and construction spending as well as an improvement in the troubled manufacturing sector. A midsession rally in oil prices spurred further buying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The real world is not as bad as what the market [has been] pricing in," said Jason Hans, a portfolio manager at BMO Global Asset Management. His team bought auto and industrial stocks on Tuesday, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 348.58 points, or 2.1%, to 16865.08. The S&amp;P 500 added 2.4% to 1978.35, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.9% to 4689.60.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors sold assets perceived as safe havens such as <span class="companylink">U.S. government</span> debt and gold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial and technology shares led Tuesday's rally. The S&amp;P 500 indexes of those sectors rose 3.5% and 3.1%, respectively. Those sectors have been among the hardest hit in the selloff earlier this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed funds futures, used by investors and traders to place bets on central-bank policy, showed Tuesday that they see a 65% likelihood of a rate increase from the Fed at its December 2016 policy meeting, according to data from <span class="companylink">CME Group</span>. The probability was 12% a month ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising interest rates help banks because they tend to widen the difference between the interest banks charge on loans and what they pay for deposits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span> was the biggest gainer in the Dow, rising 5.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index of large U.S. commercial lenders rose 4.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European shares also rallied Tuesday. The Stoxx Europe 600 climbed 1.4% to 338.72.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said recent improvements in U.S. economic data and hopes for fresh stimulus from the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> have also boosted sentiment. "We're not in the same place we were in two months ago," said Thushka Maharaj, global strategist at <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Asset Management</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier, shares in Asia ended higher as investors reacted to an injection of liquidity into the Chinese financial system from authorities on Monday. The Shanghai Composite Index rose 1.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Japan's Nikkei Stock Average added 0.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the day's gains, analysts cautioned that the latest move by <span class="companylink">China's central bank</span> is unlikely to offer long-term relief to the country's economy and financial markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">India's Sensex jumped 3.4% on growing hopes that the central bank will soon cut interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the rate-sensitive sectors, such as banks, autos and real estate, rallied in India Tuesday. <span class="companylink">ICICI Bank</span> jumped 7.2%, <span class="companylink">Maruti Suzuki</span> climbed 7.1%, <span class="companylink">Hero MotoCorp</span> rose 6.1% and <span class="companylink">Axis Bank</span> gained 4.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data Tuesday showed Chinese manufacturing activity fell to its lowest level in more than four years, as the world's second-largest economy continues to struggle with overcapacity and anemic demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In currencies, the dollar was up 1% against the yen at 113.87 yen by late afternoon in New York. The euro was nearly flat against the dollar at $1.0869.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In commodities, U.S. oil futures gained 1.9% to $34.40 a barrel. Gold futures fell 0.3% to settle at $1,230.30 a troy ounce.</p>
