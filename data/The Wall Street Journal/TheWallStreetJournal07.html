<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The owners of a Tudor-style house in Glen Ridge, N.J., spent months refinishing floors, painting walls and otherwise dressing up the place before they put it on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It took all of four days to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple, Ellen Sherman, a writer, and her husband, Christopher Hitchcock, a lawyer, received eight offers for their Forest Avenue property, all above the $697,000 asking price. They are downsizing and moving to Jersey City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We put a lot of effort into it," Ms. Sherman said. "It was a beautiful 1928 house and was very well maintained. But we wanted it to look really good."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The quick sale is a sign of the strengthening suburban home market this year -- particularly in places with easy Manhattan commutes -- as both buyers and sellers brace for the peak spring season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Any agent who works in this area knows that if someone makes an offer at the asking price -- they are not going to get the house," said Kathy Kulik, a broker at Keller Williams -- NJ Metro Group who handled the Glen Ridge sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across New Jersey, the pace of monthly sales compared with the year-earlier month has increased for 30 consecutive months, according to data from the Otteau Group, an appraisal and consulting group that tracks market data. Median prices have been trending higher as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Westchester, sales have been rising for several years. Transactions jumped 6.8% in the first quarter from a year earlier, according to brokerage firm Houlihan Lawrence. The median price rose 5.3% to $570,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Long Island, sales surged last year; the third quarter saw a record for quarterly transactions dating back to 2003, when brokerage firm <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> began tabulating sales.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising home prices are putting America's largest metropolitan areas out of reach for teachers, police officers and other big slices of the U.S. workforce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Teachers in the Denver and Austin, Texas, metro areas can afford just 13% of the homes for sale in those markets, according to a study released Wednesday by real-estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>. That is down from 20% and 16%, respectively, in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, teachers can afford less than 20% of the homes for sale in 11 of the 93 major U.S. metro areas studied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers underscore the challenges major metro regions face as home prices rise beyond what workers in many industries can afford. Workers essentially are left with a choice of leaving those areas or facing long commutes to work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People cannot afford to live where they serve their communities," said Cheryl Young, a senior economist at <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> study defines affordability as a household spending 31% of its monthly income on housing, assuming a 20% down payment and a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at current interest rates. It looks at entire metro areas -- not only at downtowns, but also at the surrounding suburbs, which long have offered more affordable housing options.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First responders such as police officers and firefighters, who sometimes need to report for work on short notice, face significant housing challenges. That is true even in some of the country's more affordable metro areas, because wages there are lower, as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First responders could afford just 19% of homes in Madison, Wis., and Raleigh, N.C., and just 23% of homes in Salt Lake City, according to <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>. In 2014, first responders could afford 32% of homes in Madison and 30% in Raleigh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, first responders can afford less than 20% of homes on the market in a half-dozen major U.S. metro areas, according to <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Food-service workers can afford less than 10% of the available homes in 56 of the 93 metro areas <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> included in the study. Typical restaurant workers in Oakland, Los Angeles, Denver, Austin and Portland, Ore., can afford less than 1% of the available listings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast, restaurant workers in the Detroit metro area can afford about half of the homes on the market, while those in Dayton, Ohio, can afford about a third, according to <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prospects of homeownership improve for households with two incomes. While a household with two restaurant workers in San Francisco and its suburbs can afford less than 1% of homes on the market, two teachers can afford about 15% of homes and two first responders can afford 39%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In San Jose, Calif., two teachers can afford 35% of homes and two first responders 58% of available listings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many lower-income workers in these areas are likely to rent rather than buy. The overall homeownership rate in the San Francisco metro area is 58%, according to U.S. Census data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The homeownership rate in more affordable metro areas tends to be higher. Some 70% of Detroit-area households own their homes, while 65% of those in the Dayton metro area do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renters face their own challenges. Average rents in the U.S. have risen more than 26% since early 2010, while home prices have risen about 28% during that time. Renters have tended to feel the squeeze more acutely, though, because rents fell less sharply than home prices during the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cities have responded to the housing crunch among low- and middle-income workers by requiring developers to set aside a portion of units in new construction for those households. But such requirements often represent a tiny fraction of the demand for moderately priced housing.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The owners of a Tudor-style house in Glen Ridge, N.J., spent months refinishing floors, painting walls and otherwise dressing up the place before they put it on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It took all of four days to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple, Ellen Sherman, a writer, and her husband Christopher Hitchcock, a lawyer, received eight offers for their Forest Avenue property, all above the $697,000 asking price. They are downsizing and moving to Jersey City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We put a lot of effort into it," Ms. Sherman said. "It was a beautiful 1928 house and was very well maintained. But we wanted it to look really good."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The quick sale is a sign of the strengthening suburban home market this year—particularly in places with easy Manhattan commutes—as both buyers and sellers brace for the peak spring season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Any agent who works in this area knows that if someone makes an offer at the asking price—they are not going to get the house," said Kathy Kulik, a broker at Keller Williams – NJ Metro Group who handled the Glen Ridge sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across New Jersey, the pace of monthly sales compared with the year-earlier month has increased for 30 consecutive months, according to data from the Otteau Group, an appraisal and consulting group that tracks market data. Median prices have been trending higher as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Westchester, sales have been rising for several years. Transactions jumped 6.8% in the first quarter compared with a year earlier, according to brokerage firm Houlihan Lawrence. The median price rose 5.3% to $570,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Long Island, sales surged last year; the third quarter saw a record for quarterly transactions dating back to 2003, when brokerage firm <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> began tabulating sales. Sales slipped in the fourth quarter, but still were the most for a fourth quarter since 2004, with median prices up nearly 5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales pickup is being driven by some of the same forces pushing up sales across the U.S., such as fears of rising interest rates, and falling inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there also are some only-in-New-York factors, especially a rise in apartment prices and rents over several years in Manhattan and Brooklyn that is driving some urban dwellers to contemplate more affordable homes with yards in the suburbs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We reached an affordability threshold in the city," said Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel Inc., who compiles the Elliman report.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market is particularly tight for lower-priced listings, and in New Jersey towns such as Montclair, Glen Ridge and others on a direct rail route to Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The dynamic at the entry-level price point is very frothy," said Chris Meyers, president of Houlihan Lawrence, which has agents in Westchester and in Fairfield County in Connecticut. "We could use some more sellers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Glen Ridge and Maplewood, both stops on the rail route in New Jersey, it can take 1.7 months to sell the available listings at the current pace, the best absorption rates in the state, according to the Otteau report. In Montclair it was 2.2 months. Statewide it was 4.4 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sue Lovit, a broker at Prominent Properties Sotheby's International Realty, said the competition in the "direct-train towns" like Glen Ridge is so fierce that buyers make offers on multiple properties at the same time and routinely offer sweeteners, agreeing to waive inspection requirements or mortgage contingencies.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hazem Ennabi, a lawyer, and his wife Kathleen, a pediatrician, along with their four children are beginning to outgrow their four-bedroom house in Chappaqua, N.Y., and are looking to upgrade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's amazing how having four small kids you could live in a room," he said. "As soon as they get bigger their stuff spreads out and their friends come over."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Working with John Oliveira, an Elliman Broker, he has been looking to spend up to about $2 million for a bigger home with a pool in the same neighborhood. He has found "a nice inventory of homes," he said, and is about to make an offer on a property that has been on the market for more than year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think the offer I am making is a good one," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Apollo Global Management LLC</span> is selling the majority of its stake in <span class="companylink">Hostess Brands Inc</span>., the maker of Twinkies and Ho Hos said Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through a public offering, the private-equity firm will sell off 18.7 million shares, slashing its stake to 2.6% from 16.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In total, affiliates of Apollo, Metropoulos &amp; Co. and the Gores Group, which own a 50% stake in the company, will offer 20.1 million shares for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the offering, Metropoulos entities will own 24.9% of Hostess common stock and Gores entities will own 12.8% of common stock in the Kansas City, Mo.-based company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apollo and Metropoulos bought the nearly century-old brand out of bankruptcy[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/SB10001424127887323826704578356733445144140] in 2013. Later, they sold a majority stake to a publicly traded special-purpose acquisition company sponsored by Gores Group in order to go public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firms turned around operations at the company, once on the brink of shutting down, by cutting costs, introducing new products, and reformulating its core Twinkie brand recipes to make the treats last twice as long on store shelves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its first quarterly report as a public company last month, Hostess reported surging sales[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/hostess-shows-americans-still-have-a-sweet-tooth-1489531700] and better-than-expected profit. The stock has run up 32% to $15.82 a share since its first day of trading in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apollo shares, inactive premarket, have climbed 60% of the past three months.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York City's libraries and other cultural organizations looking to build facilities or make repairs often endure a staggeringly long process and added costs under the agency that manages such city-funded projects, a report finds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city's Department of Design and Construction was created in 1996 to consolidate and more efficiently manage the city's capital projects. But a study issued by the Center for an Urban Future, a nonpartisan policy think tank, found that delays and cost overruns were pervasive among the 144 library and cultural projects analyzed between 2010 and 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study revealed that the median cost of construction for new library and cultural buildings managed by the DDC was $930 a square foot, compared with the $425- to $500-a-square-foot range for speculative office construction costs estimated by a <span class="companylink">New York Building Congress</span> analysis of 2015 New York City construction costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main problem: Excessive layers of reviews and approvals dragged out these projects, according to the report, conducted in partnership with the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonpartisan nonprofit group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What starts out as a well-intentioned goal of saving the city some money, I think ends up costing the city money and significantly delaying the process," said Jonathan Bowles, executive director of the Center for an Urban Future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a time when the city's population and tourism have been growing, cultural organizations and libraries have been expanding to meet rising demand. The slow process, however, hampers their ability to maximize public funding, said officials with these organizations and elected officials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The DDC manages construction projects for public buildings and infrastructure such as roads and sewers, to make sure city money is used efficiently and provide expertise some organizations lack. "This report fails to recognize the rigorous protections that safeguard taxpayer dollars," said a spokesman with the city's Department of Cultural Affairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bowles insists significant reforms are needed. The median duration for new construction projects was 2,467 days, or almost seven years, according to the study. The median length of time for mechanical-system upgrades such as the replacement and installation of fire alarms and heating and cooling equipment was 1,573 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the development time was spent in the three stages before construction begins, when cost estimates are conducted and the project's eligibility is reviewed, followed by a design phase and a period to solicit bids from contractors, the study said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Often, a lack of understanding of approval requirements, as well as changes made to the project, prolonged the preconstruction period, the study said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is partly because funding for projects comes in piecemeal from different city sources, and organizations often tack on more elements to a project as they get more money. Changes to the scope of the project, as well as some minor amendments, require approval from the city's Office of Management and Budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When library organizations managed their own projects, by contrast, the time and costs often were significantly reduced. Major renovations managed by the New York Public Library itself cost $412 a square foot and took just under two years, compared with $656 a square foot and an average duration of 80 months for projects under the DDC, according to the library's data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Queens public library, the cost estimate for a city-funded interior renovation of the Hollis branch managed by the DDC is about $2.5 million, compared with $1.2 million for a similar size state-funded interior renovation at the Ozone Park branch, Queens library officials said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We can build these libraries much faster," said Dennis M. Walcott, president and CEO of the Queens Library.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representatives for the DDC and the OMB said the city has made improvements since 2014. The DDC has reduced the time when contractors are selected for all its public-building projects from an average of one year to nine months, and shortened the design period for completed projects that started after July 1, 2014, by 50%, a department spokesman said. Construction periods for completed projects in that time period also fell by 40%, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not getting better quickly enough," said city councilman Jimmy Van Bramer.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Paul Hannon </div><div>469 words</div><div>7 April 2017</div><div>06:19</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eurozone house prices rose at the fastest pace in more than nine years during the final three months of 2016, a sign the currency area's modest economic recovery[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/ecbs-mario-draghi-its-too-soon-to-reduce-stimulus-1491464989] is deepening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">European Union</span>'s statistics agency said Friday that house prices in the three months through December 2016 were up 0.8% from the third quarter and 4.1% from the end of 2015. That was the largest annual rise since the third quarter of 2007, a year before the world-wide financial crisis was triggered by the collapse of U.S. investment bank <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pickup in house prices reflects a steady decline in unemployment rates, as well as low interest rates. Rising house prices should support growth over the coming months, since homeowners should feel wealthier and therefore inclined to spend more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the larger eurozone economies, the pickup in prices was led by Germany, which boasts the strongest jobs market and has been less affected by the currency area's government debt and banking problems. Prices there were up 1.7% on the quarter, and 6.7% on the year, although increases have been sharper in some cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were also clear signs of recovery in the countries worst hit by the financial crisis and the currency bloc's subsequent troubles. Spanish prices were up 4.4% on the year, and Irish prices were up 7.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In common with other developed regions, eurozone house prices fell after the financial crisis, but began to rise again from mid-2010. Unlike the U.S. and elsewhere, eurozone house prices then fell once more and only began to rise again in mid-2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The start of that rebound coincided with the first of a series of stimulus measures announced by the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> that were designed to boost weak economic growth and very low inflation. Those stimulus programs have led to worries in Germany and elsewhere that prices of assets—including houses—could surge and sow the seeds of another financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a speech Thursday, Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann urged the <span class="companylink">ECB</span> to consider reducing its monetary stimulus, warning that very low interest rates harbored "growing risks"[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/weidmann-could-envisage-ecb-easing-monetary-stimulus-1491472791?tesla=y] for the stability of the eurozone's financial system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The central bank must be careful that its policies don't ultimately do more harm than good," Mr. Weidmann said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are few signs of overheating in most housing markets and borrowing to fund home purchases has remained modest. According to <span class="companylink">ECB</span> figures, mortgage lending in February was just 2.9% higher than in the same month of 2016.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Germany's Housing Boom a Boon for Developers; Low borrowing costs and record immigration are spurring demand for new homes from Germans looking to park investment cash</span>
</div><div class="author">By William Wilkes </div><div>843 words</div><div>4 April 2017</div><div>05:30</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FRANKFURT—Development of middle-class housing in Germany is increasing, but the pace isn't fast enough to meet booming demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of new homes built in Germany last year hit its highest level since 1999, at around 320,000 units. But record levels of immigration helped boost demand, leading to soaring rents and home prices in major cities, data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has been mostly good for investors in public companies that focus on German housing. Three-year annualized returns are about 25%, well ahead of other sectors, according to real-estate research firm <span class="companylink">Green Street Advisors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, developers like Berlin-based CG Gruppe, which has projects worth €2.2 billion ($2.34 billion) in the pipeline, are chugging ahead on all cylinders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market is endless," said Christoph Gröner, chairman of CG Gruppe. "You have practically no risk if you invest in the middle class."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some investors who purchased rental apartments with an eye toward converting them into luxury condos might not be as fortunate. Their plans could run into trouble if the government makes it tougher to do such conversions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's probably a good case for exiting if you bought opportunistically," said John Amram, chief executive of HPBA, a Berlin-based real-estate investment boutique. "The political environment is a little hostile to put it mildly."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Germany would need to build 100,000 more homes annually to keep up with demand, according to Ralph Henger, a real-estate expert at the <span class="companylink">Cologne Institute for Economic Research</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low borrowing costs, a result of ultralow <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> interest rates and easy-money policies, are spurring demand for new homes from Germans hunting for places to park investment cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But record immigration is the main driver of stellar price gains. More migrants flocked to Germany in 2015 than in any previous year, as people fled war and economic hardship in Asia, Africa and the Middle East. A strong German economy, against a backdrop of high unemployment elsewhere in the Europe, also is fueling a strong inflow of immigrant workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both factors pushed net immigration to a record high of 1.14 million people in 2015, the latest official data show. The flow of migrants slowed somewhat in 2016, but pressure on housing remains high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Germany's planning laws allow it to build houses more easily than some European countries, such as the U.K., property development typically runs a couple of years behind demand, according to real estate services firm JLL.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data from German property research group F+B indicate purchase prices for affordable apartments rose 32% in the last five years. Rental prices have grown almost 20% in the same period. The cost of houses increased about 20% as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Germany's five largest cities—Berlin, Cologne, Frankfurt, Hamburg and Munich—face the greatest pressure. These cities saw new-home purchase prices jump 20% to 30% in February from the same month a year earlier, according to online property listing firm <span class="companylink">Scout24 AG</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Policy makers are concerned about the sharp gains in housing costs. The country's central bank, the Bundesbank, in February warned that house prices in Germany's largest cities are up to 30% overvalued[http://www.marketwatch.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/story/german-houses-are-up-to-30-overvalued-bundesbank-2017-02-20].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in Frankfurt, which city officials expect will attract a large chunk of financial jobs leaving London after Brexit, rose strongly over the past 12 months, <span class="companylink">Scout24</span> data show. House prices rose more than 30% in February compared with a year ago, and rents rose 10%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's very difficult to find somewhere you can afford in Frankfurt," student Emma Niehoff said. "There are too many banks here in Frankfurt already, too many people who will pay high prices."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jan Hebecker, head of data at <span class="companylink">Scout24</span>'s property-listing division, called the 2016 price rises in Germany's major cities "extreme," but added that price gains for newly built housing in Frankfurt and Munich had slowed at the start of 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High prices are also forcing lower-income residents into lower-quality housing than they would like. Frankfurt-based student Luisa Del Prete lived with friends in an unappealing apartment but said they had to leave because of its high cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There were rats and cockroaches in the communal stairwell," Ms. Del Prete said. "It was still too expensive."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">German policy makers in the past have intervened to stem price gains and could again surprise international investors more accustomed to the freewheeling markets of London or New York, said one real estate adviser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Angela Merkel's coalition government in 2015 set stringent rental price regulation on many occupied apartments, aimed at protecting German consumers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heiko Maas, German minister of justice and consumer protection, fired a warning shot at property investors when he announced the rental cap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rental properties "are more than just a commodity," Mr. Maas said. "They are the homes of people. Maximizing profits cannot be the sole objective."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar stalled Monday after data indicated that growth in U.S. factory sector cooled in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against 16 others, was down less than 0.1% at 90.33.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Institute for Supply Management</span> on Monday said its closely watched index of U.S. manufacturing activity fell to 57.2 in March[https://www.instituteforsupplymanagement.org/ismreport/mfgrob.cfm?SSO=1] from 57.7 in February, which had marked its highest level since August 2014. Still, a number above 50 indicates expansion in the factory sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline "is a little disappointing given the recent strength of the regional surveys, but still leaves the index close to a two-year high and suggests that GDP growth is set to accelerate," said Andrew Hunter, U.S. economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors will watch economic data, such as Friday's U.S. jobs report, closely this week for signs that the U.S. economy is strong enough for the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> to raise interest rates[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/feds-harker-still-sees-three-rate-increases-in-2017-as-appropriate-1491246399?tpl=centralbanking] again soon. Minutes from the Fed's March meeting, to be released Wednesday, could also offer hints on its plans for raising rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed-funds futures, used by investors to wager on the Fed's interest-rate policy outlook, show a 57% chance that the Fed raises rates at its June meeting, according to <span class="companylink">CME Group</span> data. Higher rates typically support the dollar by making U.S. assets more attractive to yield-seeking investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors also continue to monitor political developments. U.S. President Donald Trump is set to meet[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/donald-trump-chinas-xi-jinping-planning-to-meet-soon-1489433837] with Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the end of the week, and trade is likely to be an important topic. Mr. Trump has accused China of unfairly devaluing its currency to gain a trade advantage over the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currency traders are also awaiting new details on the Trump administration's tax-reform plans, which were expected to boost the dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first three months of the year, the dollar fell nearly 3% as investors unwound bets that the Trump administration's economic proposals would boost the U.S. economy. The administration's failure to repeal the Affordable Care Act fueled concerns among investors that it would struggle to push through tax and stimulus proposals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The reflation trade has been deflated by President Trump's setback with health care reform but we think that U.S. fundamentals remain solid, may improve further still, if the president can make some quick progress on tax reform," analysts at Scotiabank said in a research note.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing rebound has helped drive the economic recovery that began in 2009, yet indicators of its health are mixed. Homebuilders are catching up with the S&amp;P 500 after a long lag, and supply is in line with long-run averages. But home prices are running well ahead of wage growth, a function of soft housing starts and the limited number of new houses coming to market, while mortgage rates have risen the most in four years. What will coming months bring?</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto </div><div>908 words</div><div>1 April 2017</div><div>08:00</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying a home this spring will be the hardest in years. The headline on an earlier version of this article incorrectly stated it would be the hardest ever. (April 2)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robin Manthie and her husband have been looking for their first home in Minneapolis since last May. They thought this spring would bring a flood of inventory, making their search easier. But by most measures it is getting tougher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of homes for sale in Minneapolis dropped by about 25% in February compared with a year earlier, while the median sale price rose by 7.6% to $223,000, according to the Minneapolis Area Association of Realtors. That's on par with the national median home price of $228,400. The average number of days homes in the area are spending on the market is at a 10-year low of 81 days so far this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Manthie, a 33-year-old consultant, is 41 weeks pregnant, but she and her husband are still trudging to open houses most weekends in search of a four-bedroom home in the $700,000 range—up from $400,000 when they started.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's shocking. The house [two doors down from] my mother-in-law went in three hours," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year's spring selling season promises to be the toughest for buyers in a decade, economists said, as rising prices and mortgage rates combine with inventory near 20-year lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We think that 2017 will be the fastest market" since the peak of the last housing boom in 2006, said Nela Richardson, chief economist at Redfin. So far this year, homes are selling an average of eight days faster than last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It isn't just hot spots like Seattle and Denver that are seeing scarce supplies of homes for sale but also sleepier locales like Minneapolis, Cleveland, Nashville, Tenn., Tampa, Fla., and Louisville, Ky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These markets typically are enjoying strong job growth with young first-time buyers out looking for homes, but also declining inventories, according to Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists had predicted the inventory crunch would ease this year, as several years of solid price gains induced more sellers to put homes on the market and spurred home builders to break ground on more new homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, inventory has gotten tighter as demand has increased rapidly and the pickup in construction has lagged behind. Sellers also have become hesitant to put their homes on the market because rising prices and mortgage rates have made it more expensive to trade up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, the number of homes for sale hit the lowest level since the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> began tracking such data in 1999. It has ticked up slightly since, but inventory in February remained 6.4% below a year earlier and about 30% below the long-term average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, there is a growing mismatch[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/a-mismatch-of-home-buyers-and-sellers-points-to-pain-this-year-1486530001] between an abundance of high-price inventory on the market and increasing demand for starter homes. In Minneapolis, 32% of online searches are for starter homes but 21% of the inventory is in the appropriate price range, according to real-estate tracker <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>. There is a relative glut of luxury homes, which account for 40% of searches but 58% of the inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Single-family housing starts[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-housing-starts-rose-permits-fell-in-february-1489667694] rose to a 10-year high in February but remain about a third below the 50-year average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lack of inventory is pushing up home prices, which grew at the fastest rate since mid-2014 in January, climbing 5.9% compared with a year earlier, according to the S&amp;P <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> Case-Shiller Indices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding to affordability challenges for buyers, mortgage rates have risen to 4.14% from about 3.5% in November, according to mortgage-company <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists expect strong price growth and soft sales this year because there isn't enough supply to meet demand. <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> predicts home sales will decline slightly this year to 5.9 million from 6 million from last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Looking at 2017, we feel pretty good about housing but we don't think we're going to match [last year's] volume," said Len Kiefer, deputy chief economist at Freddie Mac. "The main reason for that is this tight inventory and that, when many buyers come to the market in the spring, affordability is going to be a real challenge."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike boom-bust markets such as Las Vegas, Miami and parts of coastal California, Minneapolis has typically been a fairly stable housing market. Investors are fairly rare and the area has long been an affordable place for young families to buy homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices have risen 55% since the market bottom in 2012 and hit a new high in 2016, according to the local Realtors association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Prescott, an agent at Redfin, said he has seen examples of sellers receiving 25 offers, including cash buyers bidding significantly over the listing price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't know where these cash buyers are coming from," he said. "We have not seen a market like this in the Twin Cities in a very long time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Katey Bean, a Realtor for <span class="companylink">Keller Williams Realty</span> in Minneapolis, recently held an open house for a three-bedroom bungalow priced at $265,000 and counted at least 80 attendees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You can see in their face, they just look distraught," she said of the would-be buyers. "You just almost want to hug them."</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Scores of Builders Raise Their Hands to Design Trump Border Wall; Request for preliminary pitches draws interest from more than 200 companies</span>
</div><div class="author">By Dan Frosch and Andrew Tangel </div><div>1505 words</div><div>29 March 2017</div><div>12:31</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 200 companies have expressed interest in submitting plans to help design and build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/trump-administration-gives-details-on-border-wall-plans-costs-1490044338], as the Trump administration seeks to fulfill a key campaign promise despite significant obstacles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The companies, whose names were published on a federal contracting website, vary widely in size and capability—from construction giants like <span class="companylink">Kiewit Corp</span>. to smaller, family-owned businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among those interested at this early stage are more than three dozen businesses owned by minorities, a Wall Street Journal analysis shows. Roughly 13% of the companies expected to submit proposals for the wall, for example, are owned by Hispanics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, the federal government extended a Wednesday deadline to submit preliminary pitches for the wall until April 4 because many companies had questions about the project, according to U.S. and Border Protection, which is overseeing the bidding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Brent Thielman, a construction-industry analyst at <span class="companylink">D.A. Davidson &amp; Co</span>., said the large number of companies interested showed the sheer size and scope of the project. But because so many details were unclear, including the wall's funding, coupled with potential political backlash, "The question is how many ultimately will want to be involved," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some businesses were scrambling to finish their proposals, others that indicated interest are simply tracking the project and may not follow through. Still other companies are subcontractors that listed themselves because they want to be hired by a winning bidder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Close to half of the potential bidders are located in border states, including nearly 50 in California, whose political leaders are fighting the wall. One bidder auspiciously bears the name of Roman emperor and famous wall-builder Hadrian.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the businesses signaling interest are also several major construction companies with past ties to President Donald Trump, who spent decades working with the construction industry as a real-estate developer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hustle to submit applications came in response to requests for proposals posted online by <span class="companylink">U.S. Customs and Border Protection</span> on March 17. The agency called for two designs for a wall "physically imposing in height"—one made of concrete and one of alternative material—to be built across the nearly 2,000-mile border.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress appears to be in little hurry to fund the project. Senior Republicans said this week that Mr. Trump's request for the current fiscal year isn't likely to be included in a must-pass spending bill. That means lawmakers would have to approve a stand-alone measure, or include it in other legislation later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Democrats and many Republicans skeptical about the wall, the prospects of passing a stand-alone funding bill are limited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response to a question about wall funding Wednesday, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the administration would continue to work with Congress on the budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite substantial legal and logistical hurdles, and the risks of taking on a politically divisive project, the wall has drawn at least preliminary consideration from all corners of the building industry—even unexpected ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mario Burgos, the son of an immigrant, owns an Albuquerque, N.M., construction logistics company and plans to submit a proposal. He said he viewed the project as more geared toward border security than immigration, and a surefire way to boost employment in job-strapped New Mexico.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I am not against immigrants by any stretch of the imagination," said Mr. Burgos, whose father came to the U.S. from Ecuador. "There isn't a country in the world that doesn't have borders and doesn't want to enforce them."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Burgos noted that his company, Burgos Group LLC, which holds various defense contracts with federal agencies, has handled projects in southern New Mexico near the border and was familiar with operating in remote, rugged locations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many interested companies on the list of possible bidders didn't return requests for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several companies expected to submit proposals, such as Kiewit, helped erect some of the roughly 650 miles of fencing that already snakes across the border. A Kiewit spokesman said the company doesn't publicly discuss plans to pursue or forgo such projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other interested businesses have niche specialties, like Leesburg, Va.-based Helix Steel. Chief Executive Chris Doran said Helix's products, which make concrete more resistant to blasts and other stresses, would suit what he called a "massive opportunity."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Doran, whose company has about 50 employees, said he wasn't concerned with fallout from participating in the project. "All I can say is I'm fighting for American jobs, and if fighting for American jobs is wrong, I'll take that risk," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction giant Tutor Perini Corp., a Sylmar, Calif.-based company whose projects include building a <span class="companylink">Long Island Rail Road</span> station under Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan, has indicated its interest in a potential bid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company was also the general contractor on Mr. Trump's hotel and condominium tower in Las Vegas, which opened in 2008, and has constructed other major projects in Las Vegas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representatives of <span class="companylink">Tutor Perini</span> didn't respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This stage of the government contracting process requires companies to submit their qualifications and concepts for the wall, but not detailed renderings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">U.S. Customs and Border Protection</span> said companies must design a wall that is at least 18 feet high and fashioned with anticlimbing devices. According to agency documents, submissions will be winnowed down to as many as 20 finalists, which will be asked to provide more extensive plans. Some will eventually be selected to assemble prototypes in San Diego for review.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for the agency said it would review the proposals and release more information on the bidding process as it continues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some major companies opted to skip the bidding process altogether. Executives cited the public outcry surrounding the wall, or said the project didn't fit their expertise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An executive at a major American construction company that didn't want to be named said the company wouldn't bid on the wall because it feared involvement could hurt its significant international business, especially in Mexico.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even considering the project caused internal unrest, this executive said. Employees opposed to the company's participation began circulating an internal petition, followed by one from a smaller group of employees in favor of bidding. "It was too explosive for us," the executive said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The administration's push to build the barrier has spurred recent efforts by some local Democratic lawmakers to penalize companies that participate in the project. Those efforts have been focused in California, which, along with Texas, has by far the most companies that want to help build the wall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bill introduced by state Sen. Ricardo Lara would prevent California from contracting with companies that work on the wall in that state. Another measure sponsored by Democratic legislators would require California's public employee retirement system and its teachers' retirement system, the nation's two largest pension funds, to liquidate any investments in companies working on the wall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, three San Francisco supervisors introduced legislation barring the city from contracting with companies that bid to work on the wall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One Carlsbad, Calif., company said its intention to submit a plan for the wall had nothing to do with ill will toward immigrants. Hadrian Construction Co. owner Rod Hadrian said he employs Mexican immigrants and his main goal was to promote a prefabricated product he believes will create a wall that is cheaper and easier to install in remote border areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm not trying to build a wall to keep the Mexicans out of here," Mr. Hadrian said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Patrick Balcazar, a veteran and former Army Corps of Engineers officer who owns San Diego Project Management PSC in Puerto Rico, the notion of a wall between countries isn't something he agrees with. But Mr. Balcazar, who has roots in Mexico and Ecuador, where he says his German Jewish family fled just before World War II, said the project could be a much needed boon for the economically depressed island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For us, it's work. We're in a recession in Puerto Rico," said Mr. Balcazar, whose company holds various federal contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Balcazar has been working late nights, summoning his experience with battlefield operations to craft a design he plans to submit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If we have to build this thing, let's build it right. Let's stop the bad guys and take care of the poor people who are caught in this mess," he said. "And then, let's tear it down."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A gauge of upcoming U.S. home sales firmed in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> pending home sales index, which tracks contract signings for purchases of previously owned homes, climbed 5.5% in February from the prior month to 112.3, its highest level since April 2016 and the second-highest reading since May 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a more modest 2.1% gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales typically close within a month or two of signing, so Wednesday's report could herald a sales rebound as the spring home-buying season approaches. Lawrence Yun, the NAR's chief economist, credited unusually warm weather, a rising stock market and steady hiring for the stronger sales, along with buyer expectations that interest rates could rise further in the coming months.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices rose in January at their fastest rate since mid-2014, a trend that bodes well for sellers but could start to eat into demand as buyers get priced out of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> Case-Shiller Indices, which cover the entire nation, rose 5.9% in the 12 months ended in January, the strongest increase in 31 months, up from a 5.7% year-over-year increase in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-city index gained 5.1% over the year, up from 4.8% the prior month, and the 20-city index gained 5.7%, up from a 5.5% increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The accelerating gains are being driven by job growth, a large demographic of people entering their 30s and looking to buy homes, and limited supply of homes on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said it isn't sustainable for price growth to outpace income growth for long, however. Wages are rising at about 2.5%, much slower than home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Eventually it will stop and we all hope it will stop by house price gains slowing," said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide Insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Limited supply is a big driver of the price gains. Inventory in December hit its lowest level since 1999, when the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> started tracking the data. The number of homes for sale was down 7.1% in January compared with a year earlier, the Realtors said. It has since ticked up slightly, but inventory in February remained 6.4% below a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strong price growth poses a challenge for first-time buyers trying to get into the market this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are a far larger number of buyers chasing after fewer inventories," said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors. "Prices are easily outpacing people's income growth" which is causing "consternation for renters who are trying to get into the homeownership market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of previously owned homes declined in both January and February, as tight inventory and rising prices frustrated would-be buyers. Existing-home sales declined 3.7% in February, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices hit a record in September, and the pace of growth has gradually picked up speed since then. Still, home-price growth remains less than half of what it was during the housing bubble in the mid-2000s. Prices grew by more than 14% for much of 2005, for example.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even today, price growth in the hottest markets remains comparatively muted. Seattle led the way in January with a 11.3% home-price increase, while Portland reported a 9.7% year-over-year gain and Denver had a 9.2% annual increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, Mr. Berson said some markets, such as Denver, Dallas and parts of coastal California, are showing signs of overheating and may experience a correction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising prices might be deterring some people from trading up to larger homes and shrinking the number of households that can afford to buy, said David Blitzer, managing director at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. "At some point, this process will force prices to level off and decline -- however we don't appear to be there yet."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, economists said mortgage rates remain near historic lows, which is keeping homes affordable even as prices climb. The rate for a 30-year mortgage averaged 4.23% last week, up from about 3.5% in November but still near the lowest level in decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If it was really grim for first-time buyers, wouldn't we see much more contraction of demand?" said Mark Fleming, chief economist at First American.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices rose in January at their fastest rate since mid-2014, a trend that bodes well for sellers but could start to eat into demand as buyers get priced out of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> Case-Shiller Indices, which cover the entire nation, rose 5.9% in the 12 months ended in January, the strongest increase in 31 months, up from a 5.7% year-over-year increase in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-city index gained 5.1% over the year, up from 4.8% the prior month, and the 20-city index gained 5.7%, up from a 5.5% increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The accelerating gains are being driven by job growth, a large demographic of people entering their 30s and looking to buy homes, and limited supply of homes on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said it isn't sustainable for price growth to outpace income growth for long, however. Wages are rising at about 2.5%, much slower than home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Eventually it will stop and we all hope it will stop by house price gains slowing," said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide Insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Limited supply is a big driver of the price gains. Inventory in December hit its lowest level since 1999, when the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> started tracking the data. The number of homes for sale was down 7.1% in January compared with a year earlier, the Realtors said. It has since ticked up slightly, but inventory in February remained 6.4% below a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strong price growth poses a challenge for first-time buyers trying to get into the market this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are a far larger number of buyers chasing after fewer inventories," said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors. "Prices are easily outpacing people's income growth" which is causing "consternation for renters who are trying to get into the homeownership market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of previously owned homes declined in both January and February, as tight inventory and rising prices frustrated would-be buyers. Existing-home sales declined 3.7% in February, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices hit a record in September and the pace of growth has gradually picked up speed since then. Still, home-price growth remains less than half of what it was during the housing bubble in the mid-2000s. Then prices grew by more than 14% for much of 2005, for example.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even today, price growth in the hottest markets remains comparatively muted. Seattle led the way in January with a 11.3% home-price increase, while Portland reported a 9.7% year-over-year gain and Denver had a 9.2% annual increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, Mr. Berson said some markets, such as Denver, Dallas and parts of coastal California, are showing signs of overheating and may experience a correction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising prices might be deterring some people from trading up to larger homes and shrinking the number of households that can afford to buy, said David Blitzer, managing director at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. "At some point, this process will force prices to level off and decline—however we don't appear to be there yet."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, economists said mortgage rates remain near historic lows, which is keeping homes affordable even as prices climb. The rate for a 30-year mortgage averaged 4.23% last week, up from about 3.5% in November but still near the lowest level in decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If it was really grim for first-time buyers, wouldn't we see much more contraction of demand?" said Mark Fleming, chief economist at First American.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Month-over-month, the U.S. Index rose 0.2% in January before seasonal adjustment, while the 10-city rose 0.3% and the 20-city index increased 0.2% from December to January. After seasonal adjustment, the national index rose 0.6% month-over-month, while both the 10-city and 20-city indexes rose 0.9%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A federal appeals court on Thursday agreed to speed up consideration of President Donald Trump's revised executive order barring U.S. entry for people from six Muslim-majority countries, setting oral arguments for May 8.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move, by the Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., came in response to a Justice Department request to expedite the case. The appeals court schedule isn't as fast as the department asked for, but it does move the case along more quickly than the court originally planned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fourth Circuit will be considering a Maryland judge's ruling from last week that blocked Mr. Trump from enforcing his revised order barring travel to the U.S. by people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, a move the administration says is necessary to protect the U.S. from terrorism.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The officer, who is accused of first-degree murder in the 2014 shooting of Mr. McDonald, now faces 23 counts, including first-degree murder, according to Kane County State's Attorney Joe McMahon.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. new home sales increased sharply for the second consecutive month in February, an indication that growing demand and a pickup in construction activity could help propel a strong spring selling season for this segment of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of newly built, single-family houses, which account for a small share of overall U.S. home sales, jumped 6.1% from January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate 592,000 last month, the Commerce Department said Thursday. That marked the second-strongest month since the housing-market expansion began in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected new home sales to increase by 1.4% to 563,000 sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Builders are seeing strong traffic," said Brad Hunter, chief economist at HomeAdvisor, a home-improvement website. "We are expecting strong sales going into the spring."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data were clouded by a margin of error of 17 percentage points, much larger than the reported increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, momentum appears to be building in the market. New home sales increased in January by 3.7% compared with a month earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">February sales jumped by a substantial 12.8% compared with the same month a year ago, according to the Commerce Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a sign that builders are responding to demand, the number of homes for sale at the end of February rose to the highest level since July 2009. At the current sales pace, that is enough supply for 5.4 months, below the six-month level that many economists say is indicative of a balanced market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sale price for a newly built home fell slightly in February to $296,200.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The pickup in sales coupled with low inventories suggests that single-family starts will rise further in coming months, as home builders attempt to meet increasing demand," said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide Insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Burns, chief executive of <span class="companylink">John Burns Real Estate Consulting</span>, said the home builders his company surveys reported a 14% increase in sales in February compared with last year. He said expectations for the full year call for roughly 7% sales growth compared with last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Burns said builders got a boost from buyers looking to beat rising interest rates, but that is likely to last only a couple of months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're having a good spring but not some hockey stick recovery," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists expect new-home sales to continue to increase this year as builders step up construction of single-family homes and more first-time buyers enter the starter-home market. Single-family housing starts rose to a 10-year high in February, thanks to a strengthening economy and unseasonably warm weather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the housing market picture isn't entirely rosy. Purchases of previously owned homes, which account for the vast majority of the market, decreased by 3.7% in February from a month earlier, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Wednesday. Economists said rising prices and mortgage rates, along with a shortage of inventory, are keeping many first-time buyers out of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates for a 30-year mortgage averaged 4.23% this week, according to mortgage company <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, down from 4.3% a week earlier but up from about 3.5% in November.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales declined in February as tight inventory and rising prices frustrated would-be buyers and damped sales activity heading into the critical spring selling season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of previously owned homes, which account for the vast majority of U.S. sales, decreased 3.7% from January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.48 million last month, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline followed a strong performance in January, when sales rose 3.3%. February's sale pace was 5.4% above the same month a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said the combination of rising prices and mortgage rates is expected to push some buyers out of the market this year, especially in expensive coastal markets where first-time purchasers are already stretching to afford homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You either have to believe that we're in a bubble right now or you have to believe that sales are going to decline," said Todd Tomalak, vice president of research at <span class="companylink">John Burns Real Estate Consulting</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nela Richardson, chief economist at Redfin, said the company has seen a slight decline in the number of buyers touring properties and making offers—indicating they are frustrated by a lack of homes for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Inventory may be having a bigger effect on sales [this year] than last year," Ms. Richardson said. "It's just there's not a lot for sale."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventory increased 4.2% at the end of February from a month earlier, after December's reading was the lowest since the Realtors association began tracking all types of supply in 1999. Inventory in February was still down 6.4% from a year earlier. At the current sales pace, it would take 3.8 months to exhaust the supply of existing homes on the market, the Realtors said Wednesday. Economists say the typical supply is roughly six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We just don't have enough inventory to satisfy all the buying interest," said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low inventory is also helping to push up prices. The median sale price rose 7.7% in February from a year earlier, to $228,400. Experts said rapid price increases are creating concerns about affordability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I would be happier if it was not as frothy," said Greg Rand, founder and chief executive of OwnAmerica, a broker for investors in single-family rental properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said the rise in mortgage rates that began in December may have caused some buyers to rush into the market to lock in lower rates, pushing forward some demand. Rates for a 30-year mortgage rose to 4.3% last week, the highest level this year, according to mortgage company <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home construction is starting to pick up, which could relieve some of the inventory crunch in the coming months. U.S. single-family housing starts in February hit their highest level since the recession[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-housing-starts-rose-permits-fell-in-february-1489667694], boosted by warm weather and a strong economy.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, the benchmark Taiex index ended at a 23-month high. It has risen 11% since mid-September, according to FactSet. This would make it the 10th best-performing stock market globally during this period, in U.S. dollar terms. Since hitting a bottom in early 2016, the Taiex is up 30%, outstripping gains of 19% in the Shanghai Composite Index and 18% in South Korea's Kospi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gains have come despite Donald Trump's ascent to the U.S. presidency and his harder line on trade, while at the same time embarking on a foreign policy that risks upending longstanding diplomatic ties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before taking office, Mr. Trump spoke with Taiwan's president and said the U.S. might not continue its "One China" policy, which has underpinned Sino-U.S. relations for decades. Last month, Mr. Trump reaffirmed the U.S.'s commitment to the One China policy in a phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the political uncertainty, investors have focused instead on the prospect of improving economic growth and a fading sense of crisis in China. In Taiwan, they are focused on the iPhone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The island's stocks of late have "been doing well for a couple of reasons," said Arthur Kwong, head of Asia-Pacific stocks at <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas Investment Partners</span>. "On top is Apple."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apple's shares have jumped nearly 25% over the past six months amid hopes for a big year for the iPhone, which celebrates its 10th anniversary in 2017[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/apples-next-iphone-will-have-a-curved-screen-1488260583]. A number of Taiwan's technology stocks have come along for the ride.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among them, <span class="companylink">Largan Precision Co</span>., which manufactures dual casings for the iPhone, has jumped 30% since mid-September. <span class="companylink">Hon Hai Precision Industry Co</span>., or Foxconn, which assembles iPhones, has climbed 18%. <span class="companylink">Catcher Technology Co</span>., which supplies casings, has gained 12%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taiwanese tech stocks that supply Apple make up more than 25% of the Taiex's weighting, with Apple accounting for up to 50% of the companies' revenue. The gains have helped drive the index back toward the 10000 level that it hasn't been able to solidly break through for two decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tech companies also have helped boost Taiwan's attractiveness for foreign investors. Last month, foreigners bought a net $1.6 billion in Taiwanese stocks, the most since August, according to data from <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse Group AG</span>. For the first 10 weeks of 2017, Taiwan had the highest amount of net foreign buying among emerging markets in Asia excluding China, at $2.8 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a move to own Apple supply stocks," said Randy Abrams, a semiconductor analyst at Credit Suisse. Many emerging-market funds can't buy directly into Apple, so they look to the supply chain for alternatives, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Abrams called Taiwan's strong stock gains noteworthy given Mr. Trump's tough talk on trade tariffs. The country's stock market is typically more affected by trade issues, as exports make up about 70% of Taiwan's economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beijing also has been ramping up its efforts to isolate the island, which it considers Chinese territory, in the months since the inauguration of President Tsai Ing-wen[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/taiwans-new-president-skirts-one-china-consensus-in-inaugural-address-1463723943], leader of a party that favors Taiwan independence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the effects of those developments on stocks have been muted. In December, after then President-elect Trump spoke on the phone[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/donald-trumps-call-with-taiwan-leader-raises-fresh-uncertainty-over-u-s-china-relations-1480789321] with Ms. Tsai—the first time[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/trumps-phone-call-with-taiwan-president-sparks-china-complaint-1480762723] a U.S. president or president-elect has spoken with the leader of Taiwan since diplomatic ties were cut off in 1979, much to the ire of Beijing—the Taiex dropped just 0.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We haven't seen [Trump's] threats carried through…[and] the Taiwanese companies are very much required in the supply chain," said Andrew Gillan, head of Asia ex-Japan equities at <span class="companylink">Henderson Global Investors</span>, to explain the gains despite political uncertainty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Taiex index has logged the biggest gains among Asian emerging markets over the past six months and hasn't closed down 1% or more in any session since November. That 82-session streak is easily the index's longest since at least 1986, according to Wall Street Journal market data. The Taiex dates to 1966.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bigger risk may come from Apple. In September, the Taiex rose 3% over the three sessions leading up to the Sept. 7 launch of the iPhone 7[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/apple-set-to-unveil-latest-iphone-1473261964]. But the handset didn't have much in the way of a wow factor, and the Taiex declined 3.9% the following week as Apple's shares fell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fiscal 2016, which ended in September, marked the first time Apple recorded lower year-over-year iPhone sales. Investors are betting Apple will deliver more than just incremental improvements for its next iPhone. If they are wrong, Apple's share price could suffer and damp enthusiasm for Taiwan's tech stocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If we have any downward demand shock, we could see disappointment," said <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>'s Mr. Abrams.</p>

</div><div class="author">By WSJ Staff </div><div>536 words</div><div>19 March 2017</div><div>15:00</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The week ahead will bring data from advanced economies around the globe, from European wages and British inflation to Japan's trade surplus and the U.S. housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MONDAY: The <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> is looking for signs that the recent energy-driven pickup in inflation will turn into something more durable, and has made clear that acceleration in wages will be needed for that to happen. The <span class="companylink">European Union</span>'s statistics agency on Monday releases wage growth figures for the fourth quarter of 2016, but they are expected to show only a modest pickup from the three months to September despite a continuing drop in unemployment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than a half-dozen <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> officials will speak this week, on the heels of the U.S. central bank's decision to raise short-term interest rates[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/fed-raises-interest-rates-remains-on-track-to-keep-tightening-1489600935?] for the third time since the financial crisis. First up, on Monday, is Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, who has called for a "slow pace of normalization" and who voted in favor of last week's rate increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TUESDAY: The <span class="companylink">Office for National Statistics</span> will release February consumer-price index data. U.K. consumer prices were up 1.8% in January from a year earlier, closing in on the <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span>'s 2% inflation goal as they were boosted by the pound's fall since last summer's Brexit vote. The BOE held its benchmark rate steady[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/bank-of-england-turns-hawkish-on-rates-1489666209] last week, but minutes of the meeting said some officials thought "it would take relatively little further upside news on the prospects for activity or inflation for them to consider that a more immediate reduction in policy support might be warranted."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WEDNESDAY: <span class="companylink">Japan's Finance Ministry</span> will release February trade data (release time is Tuesday evening in the U.S.). Economists expect a trade surplus of 881.4 billion yen ($7.78 billion), much larger than the surplus of ¥239.9 billion reported in the same month a year earlier. Economists will be looking for signs of a sustained turnaround in exports after softness last year, helped by a rebound in demand for Japanese goods in the U.S. and Asia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates in the U.S. have risen in recent months. The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>'s monthly report on existing-home sales could show if higher borrowing costs damped buyer demand in February. That hasn't happened yet: January's sales pace was the strongest since February 2007. Data on the smaller market for newly built homes will come Thursday from the Commerce Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FRIDAY: <span class="companylink">IHS Markit</span>'s survey of purchasing managers has pointed to a pickup in eurozone economic growth during the first two months of the year, and the March reading is expected to confirm acceleration in the first quarter. Although the composite PMI is expected to fall to 55.8 from 56.0 in February, that would leave it well above the 50 mark that divides growth from contraction, and above levels common during the recovery to date.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto </div><div>485 words</div><div>17 March 2017</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Workers searching for a place to live that offers a good combination of career opportunities and affordable housing are finding the best options aren't always the most obvious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past six years, cities have boomed with young workers flocking to downtown areas seeking better career and entertainment options.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has altered some of the traditional relationships between job availability and housing affordability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In places such as New York and San Francisco, which offer the greatest array of high-paying jobs, rents and home prices have shot up beyond the reach of many young workers. The squeeze has even affected the Bay Area's amply compensated technology workers, whose salaries often aren't enough to offset the rapidly rising rents and housing costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Technology workers who own a home in Seattle, by contrast, can expect to have about $2,000 more of disposable income left over each month after paying housing costs and taxes than those who live in San Francisco, according to a new analysis by Zillow and <span class="companylink">LinkedIn Corp</span>. out Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seattle tech workers who own their homes keep an average of 59% of their incomes after housing and tax costs, while Bay Area tech workers pocket just 37%, according to the study. In Austin, workers hold on to 54% of their incomes if they rent and 62% if they own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This points out a lot of markets that have the ability to offer good housing choices without breaking the bank," said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Zillow analysis also shows that a city can lose its historical advantage when its housing market takes off and salaries don't keep pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Denver, for example, has emerged as an affordable alternative to the Bay Area in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But its housing market has been on a tear. Average home prices in Denver have risen nearly 60% since the bottom of the market in February 2009, according to the S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price index. Rents, meanwhile, have jumped almost 50% since 2010, according to Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surge in housing costs makes it less of a bargain. A typical technology worker moving to Denver from San Francisco would have $140 less disposable income a month, according to Zillow, because salaries in Denver are now lower relative to home prices than they are in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As a city you want to be very careful that you also stay affordable," Ms. Gudell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That doesn't mean workers in San Francisco have it easy. Even well-paid finance professionals who own homes there keep only about 32% of their incomes after paying rent and taxes, compared with workers in Chicago and Charlotte who pocket about 60%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">U.S. government</span>-bond market pulled back Thursday after the biggest one-day price rally since June, while prices of German bunds and U.K. gilts also weakened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for these haven bonds retreated after preliminary results suggested the Dutch political establishment held on to power in Wednesday's election, defeating an anti-immigration candidate who wants to leave the <span class="companylink">European Union</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bond market reflected "the relief on the presumed outcome from the Netherlands," said Jim Vogel, market strategist at FTN Financial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two other factors also hurt bond prices: A report showed housing starts rose to a four-month high in February, a positive signal for the U.S. housing market and the <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span> kept its key policy interest rate steady but signaled that a shift toward tightening policy may not be far off amid signs of inflation pressure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note closed at 2.526%, up from 2.500% Wednesday. Yields rise as bond prices fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The yield on the 10-year gilt rose to 1.259% and the yield on the 10-year German bund climbed to 0.449%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government-bond yields in the U.S. and Europe have risen from historic lows set last summer. Improving global economic growth, upticks in inflation signals and the prospect of a large fiscal stimulus from President Donald Trump have dented investors' appetite for haven government debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The macro backdrop has been giving the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> some leeway to continue normalizing monetary policy while reducing the need for the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> and the <span class="companylink">Bank of Japan</span> to boost bond-buying monetary stimulus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the peak of the selling earlier this week, the 10-year Treasury yield rose above 2.6% and reached the highest since September 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With inflation readings either reaching major central banks' targets or getting closer, the risk for government bonds is a monetary-policy pivot into tightening mode, say investors. The Fed is expected to raise rates two more times this year and more in 2018. The <span class="companylink">ECB</span> may start tapering bond buying sooner than investors anticipate. The BOJ may also pull back if policy makers successfully push up inflation to their target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday, one official from the BOE dissented in favor of higher borrowing costs and others said it might not be long before they do the same.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edward Fitzpatrick, portfolio manager at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said he expects a further rise in bond yields given the "global synchronized uplift" in the economy and the prospect of "less accommodative policy" from major central banks. He expects the 10-year Treasury yield to rise to between 3% and 3.5% by year-end.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Andrew Tangel and Josh Zumbrun </div><div>978 words</div><div>16 March 2017</div><div>12:31</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Optimism is giving way to impatience among makers of excavators and heavy machinery that hope their businesses will benefit from President Donald Trump's pledge to pump $1 trillion into infrastructure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some machinery makers are concerned over whether Mr. Trump will invest the time needed to win congressional backing for large road, bridge and rail projects. The president's budget, released Thursday, contained scant details of how such a plan might unfold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's frustration that the infrastructure priority seems to be sliding," said Glen Calder, co-owner of Calder Brothers Corp. a Taylors, S.C.-based maker of road pavers and graders. "It's one of the campaign staples on both sides, and therefore you would expect that there's a fair amount of agreement on what should and could and needs to be done."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More public works projects could lift sales for equipment makers that have battled sluggish activity from construction, farming and mining clients in recent years. Stocks of companies that could benefit from a construction push rose sharply following Mr. Trump's election: Machinery giant <span class="companylink">Deere &amp; Co</span>.'s stock is up 24%, crane and aerial work platform-maker Terex Corp. 32% and construction management firm <span class="companylink">AECOM</span> 30%. Though those stocks are still up sharply from the fall, some have underperformed the broader S&amp;P 500 this year as investors weighed the timing of more infrastructure spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The president's budget for the next fiscal year[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/trump-budget-seeks-big-cuts-to-environment-arts-foreign-aid-1489636861] provided little guidance to machinery executives hoping to learn more about the timing or scope of an infrastructure push. The president's budget director, Mick Mulvaney, told reporters that infrastructure isn't the most urgent priority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We think the order is health care, tax policy and then infrastructure," Mr. Mulvaney said. The administration also hopes accomplishing regulatory reform first will allow "more bang for the buck" when it rolls out a more comprehensive plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trump reiterated his commitment to the infrastructure plan in his February address to Congress[http://blogs.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/washwire/2017/02/28/prepared-text-of-donald-trumps-speech-to-congress/], saying that his building boom[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/trump-begins-to-map-out-1-trillion-infrastructure-plan-1489012229] will rely in part on private investors[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/donald-trumps-infrastructure-plan-faces-speed-bumps-1478884989]. House Speaker Paul Ryan has said as little as $25 billion in federal spending could be combined with $975 billion from the private sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without significant increases in federal spending, there may not be many new projects beyond those state and local governments were planning anyway. Analysts say public-private partnerships may not be enough to tackle the country's infrastructure needs, in part because local officials are often reluctant to ask voters to foot the bill through tolls[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/frugal-motorists-test-private-toll-roads-1458379807] or taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Mr. Trump's plan runs into obstacles, he wouldn't be the first president to have his building ambitions stymied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During his first month in office in 2009, President Barack Obama signed an $800 billion stimulus package that included over $100 billion in funding for infrastructure. Many of the projects didn't break ground for over a year. Some of the funding was never used because projects such as high-speed rail links were abandoned before the work even started.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are very few shovel-ready projects," said Glenn Hubbard, a Columbia University professor and former Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush. "The first thing we have to do, if we're serious about infrastructure, is speed it up."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A big infrastructure build would benefit the entire economy. When respondents to The Wall Street Journal's survey of economists raised their averages forecasts for growth in 2018 to 2.5% from 2% before the election, many cited the lift an infrastructure package could provide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A $1 trillion stimulus program, spread over a decade, would employ over 800,000 workers for five years, according to Moody's Analytics, but it would take two years before it reached that scale, and then would taper off in later years. The firm estimates that every $1 increase in federal infrastructure spending will increase gross domestic product by roughly $1.21 in the subsequent year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many executives don't expect to see effects of such spending, immediately. They anticipate regulatory reviews like environmental permitting can drag on for years; or, contractors may not need new equipment right away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Anything that the new administration did, even if they were there today, you won't see the benefit of that until 2018 at best," said Rob Charter, a group president at Peoria, Ill.-based <span class="companylink">Caterpillar Inc</span>., the mining and construction machinery giant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Legislating the spending push could take a back seat to priorities such as overhauling health-care laws and the corporate tax code.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They stand in front of the other pieces of the agenda," Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former director of the Congressional Budget Office and president of the conservative American Action Forum think tank, said at a conference of the National Association of Business Economics. "Infrastructure is going to take a long time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Moody's</span> projection assumes the federal government would contribute roughly $250 billion. The firm believes a bigger barrier to implementing the plan quickly could be finding enough workers. "There is a dearth of construction workers in many parts of the country," said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, adding that the places with the highest demand for infrastructure are likely to be regions that already have few idle workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, construction industry executives are hopeful Mr. Trump's plans will spell good news for their companies, even if many details remain unclear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's just an attitude right now," said John Garrison, chief executive of Terex, which is based in Connecticut. "People think that things are going to be better."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto and Ben Leubsdorf </div><div>657 words</div><div>16 March 2017</div><div>11:07</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. single-family housing starts in February hit their highest level since the recession thanks to warm weather, a strengthening economy and increased demand from buyers looking to get ahead of rising mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts rose 3% in February from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.288 million, above the revised January rate of 1.251 million, the Commerce Department said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Permits, an indication of how much construction is in the pipeline, fell 6.2% to 1.213 million from the revised January total of 1.293 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected a 0.8% increase in starts and a 1.6% decline in permits. Construction typically begins a month or two after a permit is issued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of single-family starts in February was at its strongest level since October 2007, and the figure for single-family permits last month was the best since September 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Even millennials are deciding that buying might make more sense for them," said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group. "The mentality is, ‘If I wait rates may be higher and prices may be higher.'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Terry Russell, chief executive of FrontDoor Communities, a private home builder based in Atlanta, said he has seen a significant pick-up in activity. In Naples, Fla., an area where he sells primarily to retirees and second-home buyers, he said he's sold 40 or 50 homes in the last few months in some communities -- significantly more than usual.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's some sentiment that [the market] is going to have a little bit more legs than what we had last year," he said. "You're not going to see a lot of pricing power but you're going to see more customers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Home prices increased 5.8% in 2016[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-home-prices-end-2016-on-high-note-case-shiller-says-1488290979], according to the S&amp;P <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> Case-Shiller Indices. Mortgage rates have risen to 4.3% from about 3.5% before the election, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. Wednesday's decision by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> to raise short-term interest rates[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/fed-raises-interest-rates-remains-on-track-to-keep-tightening-1489600935] could ultimately also help nudge mortgage rates higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market for new single-family homes has continued to strengthen as apartment-building construction has weakened. Single-family construction rose 6.5% in February from the previous month, while multifamily construction fell 3.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total housing starts declined by a revised 1.9% in January, driven by a 7.3% drop in multifamily construction. Total starts in February were up 6.2% compared with a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The rise now to a new higher level of starts looks to be very sustainable and maybe some momentum on top of that," Mr. Hoffman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monthly housing figures are choppy, have a significant margin of error and can be subject to large revisions. Last month's 3% gain had a margin of error of 13 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month was one of the warmest Februarys on record, boosting construction activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But builders also are showing growing confidence that a stronger economy, lawmakers' pledge to roll back land-use and financial regulations, and a rush of buyers looking to beat rising interest rates all could help boost the building industry this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What we're seeing currently in the market is a fairly rapid get-off-the-fence type of move," said Carl Reichardt, an analyst at financial-services firm BTIG. "Builders were very positive and much more positive about current sales than they have been in a long time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builder confidence jumped to its highest level since 2005[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/home-builder-confidence-jumps-to-highest-since-2005-1489591811] in February, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> said Wednesday.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales in New Jersey surged in January, continuing a trend of strengthening sales as the employment picture continues to improve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new and existing homes in January increased 14% compared with the same month in 2016, and rose 31% from 2015, according a market report by Jeffrey Otteau, president of the Otteau Group, an appraisal and consulting firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Looking ahead, expectations for deregulation and tax cuts are likely to further boost sales, particularly for luxury homes, which have lagged since the start of the last recession," Mr. Otteau said in an email.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report showed that the pace of sales increased for the 29th consecutive month, with activity in January the highest for the month since 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the inventory of unsold homes fell to the lowest January level since 2005. Most of the state's 21 counties had a normal balance between supply and demand, the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Counties near New York City [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/hoboken-n-j-is-a-happening-place-1471599002]had the tightest supply of homes, with Hudson County sitting on just 2.9 months of supply at the current sales pace, followed by Essex and Union Counties. The weakest markets were at the southern end of the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data showed that sales strengthened the most on homes priced between $1 million and $2.5 million. The surge of 19% above January 2016 could be due to increased optimism among higher-income households under the Trump administration for tax cuts [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/donald-trumps-speech-agenda-will-face-legislative-challenges-1488382057]and stronger economic growth, according to the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales for the lowest-price homes, less than $400,000, jumped 16%. The weakest category was for homes sold for more than $2.5 million, which showed a decline of 18% from January 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Foreclosure filings[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/new-jersey-tops-national-foreclosure-list-for-second-consecutive-year-1484197261] declined slightly in 2016, and are on track to fall again this year, the report said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto </div><div>735 words</div><div>28 February 2017</div><div>11:39</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices jumped in December to their fastest full-year growth since 2013, as buyers shrugged off the effects of higher interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> Case-Shiller Indices, covering the entire nation, rose 5.8% in the 12 months ended in December, compared with a 5.6% year-over-year increase reported in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-city index gained 4.9% over the year, up from 4.4% the previous month, while the 20-city index gained 5.6% year-over-year, versus a 5.2% increase in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The big takeaway from this report is that all signs that the housing market was going to cool in 2016 are now reversed," said Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>. "The spring selling season is going to be another doozy for home buyers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hottest markets in the country remain concentrated in the northwest, as many buyers priced out of the Silicon Valley area flee to secondary technology hubs. Seattle led the way with a 10.8% increase, while Portland posted a 10% year-over-year gain and Denver had an 8.9% annual increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A number of markets that have seen prices grow modestly since the recession are starting to see much faster rates of increase than they had in the recent past. Tampa, Fla., jumped 8.4%, while Atlanta enjoyed a gain of 6.3% and Las Vegas increased 5.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, home prices hit a record in September and have continued climbing by more than 5% year-over-year since then, driven by strong demand and a shortage of homes for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing inventory in December hit its lowest level since 1999, when the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> started tracking the data. The number of homes for sale was down 7.1% in January compared with a year earlier, the Realtors said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With all 20 cities seeing prices rise over the last year, questions about whether this is a normal housing market or if prices could be heading for a fall are natural," said David Blitzer, managing director at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Mr. Blitzer said the rate of appreciation is much higher than the average pace of 1.3% since 1975, it remains within the range economists consider normal. "Home prices are rising, but the speed is not alarming," he said. Annual growth has ranged from -4% to 7% about two thirds of the time since 1975.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If mortgage rates continue to rise, economists said, the current rapid rate of home-price growth likely will slow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm not sure that it's a bubble because demand is coming from solid job growth and improving demographics," said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide Insurance. "I don't think it's a bubble, but I don't think it's sustainable, nor is it healthy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wages increased 2.5% in the year ending in January, better than the 2% gains that were common earlier in the recovery but still much slower than the rate of home-price growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Month-over-month the U.S. Index rose 0.2% in December before seasonal adjustment, while the 10-city and the 20-city index increased 0.3% from November to December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After seasonal adjustment, the national index rose 0.7% month-over-month, while the 10-city and 20-city index rose 0.9% month-over month. After seasonal adjustment, all 20 cities posted price gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">December's numbers reflect the peak of a sharp rise in mortgage rates since Election Day. Average rates for 30-year fixed mortgages rose from roughly 3.5% around Election Day to 4.32% at the end of December, according to mortgage company <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. In the past week they averaged 4.16%, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> said last Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of existing homes[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/january-home-sales-reach-highest-level-in-a-decade-realtors-say-1487777236] increased 3.3% in January from a month earlier, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Wednesday, suggesting continued strong demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher interest rates tend to put a damper on price growth because they drive up the monthly cost of a mortgage. That combined with the fact that prices have risen faster than incomes could pose challenges to the market later this year, economists said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market could be cooling, according to an early indicator of home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending home sales, which measure how many homes went under contract, fell 2.8% from a month earlier to an index of 106.4 in January, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales rose 0.4% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index reading was the lowest level in a year.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The significant shortage of listings last month along with deteriorating affordability as the result of higher home prices and mortgage rates kept many would-be buyers at bay," National Association of Realtors economist Lawrence Yun said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales rebounded in January after posting a steep decline in December, an indication that the new-construction market remains on the path to recovery despite bumps along the way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of newly built, single-family houses, which account for a small share of overall U.S. home sales, increased 3.7% from December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 555,000 last month, the Commerce Department said Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data was clouded, however, by a margin of error of 18.5 percentage points that is much larger than the reported increase. A 15.8% increase in Northeast sales led the pack last month, but that figure had a margin of error of 79.3 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales numbers tend to be volatile because they are based off a small number of sales, especially in the winter months in the Northeast. The more reliable existing single-family home sales, which make up about 90% of the market, increased 3.3% in December, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 12-month rolling total of new homes sold, which helps smooth out some of the monthly volatility, is up 12% year-over-year, according to Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're seeing new-home sales climb pretty solidly month after month," he said. New-home sales are now at about 85% of their 50-year norm, according to Mr. McLaughlin, although that doesn't account for population growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, an estimated 561,000 new homes were sold in 2016, up 12% from a year earlier and the fifth straight year of sales growth. The annual figure indicates broad improvement in the market, even if sales of new homes remain well below where they were during the housing boom of the 2000s, when they topped 1 million a year for four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists expect new-home sales to continue to increase this year as builders step up construction of single-family homes and more first-time buyers come into the starter-home market. Single-family construction climbed 1.9% in January, while multifamily construction tumbled 10.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventory of new homes available for sale climbed sharply in January to the highest level since September 2009, a good sign for home shoppers in the months to come, according to Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Lately, builders have been focused largely on serving a higher-end clientele, and the extent to which they can build a product affordable to the lower and middle segments of the market will go a long way in determining how the upcoming spring season shakes out," Ms. Gudell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One factor holding back demand is that land, construction and regulatory costs have driven up prices for finished single-family homes beyond what many families can afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, home builders say they are starting to see younger buyers come back into the market, along with more older buyers cashing in on rising home prices to buy newer homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Executives at <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> said on a recent investor call that contracts for new homes were up 42% in January compared with a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The pent-up demand of the past seven years may be starting to release, bringing more buyers into the market, especially in the move-up segment where rising home values are giving buyers more equity when they sell their homes in order to move up," said Bob Toll, executive chairman of Toll Brothers Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Burns, chief executive of <span class="companylink">John Burns Real Estate Consulting Inc</span>., found in a survey of home builders that January sales rose 14% compared with a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The entry-level buyer is coming back," he said. It is getting easier to qualify for a mortgage "and people are finding out that they don't necessarily need a 20% down payment to buy a home," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, builders are watching mortgage rates closely, which could push up the price of buying a new home significantly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average rates for 30-year fixed mortgages rose from roughly 3.5% around Election Day to 4.32% at the end of December, according to mortgage company <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. Rates have since edged down, averaging 4.16%, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> said Thursday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">L.A. Spec Home Seeks $100 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A month after a Los Angeles spec house was unveiled with an asking price of $250 million, another super high-end L.A. spec house is hitting the market, this one with a $100 million price tag.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The newly built home, being offered by developer Nile Niami, is in the Beverly Hills neighborhood of Trousdale Estates. The house next door to this one sold in 2014 for $70 million, which local agents say is a Beverly Hills record. Earlier this month, another property down the street sold for $65 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dubbed Opus by Mr. Niami, the $100 million home includes seven bedrooms in its 20,500 square feet. It features a gold motif, and includes a gold Lamborghini Aventador roadster and a gold Rolls Royce Dawn. All furnishings and art, including three Damien Hirst works valued at approximately $2 million, are part of the deal, Mr. Niami said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Champagne vault includes 170 bottles of Cristal Champagne. There are also "electric toilets that do everything for you," and "a television that comes out of the ceiling and spins around 360 degrees," Mr. Niami said. Another perk: a full-time house manager, whose salary has been pre-paid for two years. The home won't be going onto the multiple-listing service, according to Mr. Niami. The listing agent is Drew Fenton of Hilton &amp; Hyland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A onetime movie producer who began developing houses in 1997, Mr. Niami, 48, said he has another house under construction in Bel Air that he plans to list next year for $500 million.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Warren Buffett Lists California Beach Home</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Billionaire investor Warren Buffett is putting his longtime California beach house on the market for $11 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it sells anywhere near its asking price, Mr. Buffett will score a decent return: He bought the Laguna Beach home in 1971 for $150,000. Mr. Buffett said he bought the house because his then-wife liked it, without giving a thought to its potential as an investment. At the time Laguna Beach "wasn't fully developed," he said, but since then the area "just took off." He added that he has put a considerable amount of money into renovating the home over the years</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 86-year-old Berkshire Hathaway chairman, who lives primarily in Omaha, Neb., said he used the property for years as a beach house for his family, spending summers and Christmases there. But since his first wife, Susan, died in 2004, he hasn't spent much time there, which is why he's putting the home on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The six-bedroom home is a short walk from the ocean in the affluent gated community of Emerald Bay, said listing agent Bill Dolby of Villa Real Estate. The three-level house has an all-white exterior. It spans about 3,600 square feet, and a family room has a large deck with ocean views. Mr. Buffet said he remodeled the house several times over the years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consistent with Mr. Buffett's famous frugality, the house is "on the simpler side" for Emerald Beach, Mr. Dolby said. It has few of the pricey flourishes expected in the homes of billionaires. Much of the flooring is grey carpeting; the kitchen countertops are mostly white laminate. Mr. Buffett said he prefers not to be directly on the beach for privacy and quiet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the family gathered at the house for Christmas, Mr. Buffett said he often holed up in the master bedroom to write <span class="companylink">Berkshire Hathaway</span>'s annual report. He also recalled making frequent trips to nearby Disneyland with his children and houseguests.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">$27.5 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger is listing his Miami-area home -- which has design elements like scratch-and-sniff wallpaper -- for $27.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the home fetches its asking price, it would set a record for Golden Beach, the small town where it is located, said listing agents Jill Hertzberg and Jill Eber of the Jills team at <span class="companylink">Coldwell Banker Residential Real Estate</span>. The highest-priced home sale to date in Golden Beach was a $22.5 million sale in 2014, they said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hilfiger bought the roughly 14,000-square-foot house in 2013 for $17.25 million, according to public records, then renovated it with bright colors and patterns. "We wanted it to be really unusual," said Mr. Hilfiger, 65.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Protesters Arrested</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Evacuation Begins</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ten protesters opposed to the Dakota Access Pipeline were arrested Wednesday as law-enforcement authorities began the evacuation of the main protest campsite in North Dakota.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The evacuation began largely without incident, as law-enforcement officials and protest organizers worked for a calm resolution to what has often been a volatile monthslong standoff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a small group of protesters refused to leave and were arrested, according to Gov. Doug Burgum. Some protesters set fire to teepees and other structures before they left the camp, according to social media posts from the site and the governor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Law-enforcement officials didn't enter the campsite Wednesday, Mr. Burgum said Wednesday evening, but he added that officials would move in Thursday at 9 a.m. to continue with cleanup efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thousands of protesters have gathered near Cannon Ball, N.D., since August to protest the $3.8 billion pipeline, which the tribe says threatens sacred sites and drinking-water supplies.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Supreme Court threw out an African-American inmate's death sentence, finding Texas state-court proceedings were flawed by a psychologist's testimony that blacks were more prone to violence than members of other races.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our law punishes people for what they do, not who they are," Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the court. By a 6-2 vote, the justices found it likely that Duane Buck, convicted of a 1995 double murder, was sentenced to death rather than life imprisonment because of statistical evidence from psychologist Walter Quijano that blacks and Hispanics committed a disproportionate number of violent crimes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chief Justice Roberts was joined by Justices Anthony Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The court based its decision on the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel, something Mr. Buck was denied when his own attorney called Dr. Quijano to testify at the penalty phase of the trial.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is deja vu in China's housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After more than a year of frenzy, the all-important property market -- the heart of the Chinese economy and the driver of global commodity demand -- is cooling down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices for new homes edged up 0.2% in January from the previous month, the slowest growth in more than a year, according to the country's statistics bureau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average prices in the biggest cities -- including Shanghai and Shenzhen, which kicked off the rally in 2015 -- basically stopped going up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is little doubt that the property market has slowed. Local governments rolled out a spate of tightening measures on mortgages and homebuying restrictions last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But investors will have only government data to gauge the market from now on, since a popular housing-price benchmark from a private-sector provider ceased publishing after the November data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index, from online real-estate portal Fang.com, showed a much bigger rise in housing prices last year than the official data and presumably would be showing a bigger fall now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fang's chairman said the company stopped disclosing the index, which surveyed 100 cities compared with the government's 70 and was released up to three weeks earlier each month, because of "self-discipline."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while the bubble may not be getting bigger, the problems haven't gone away. Land bought by developers at the peak of the frenzy sits on their books, and the money borrowed to buy that land will have to be repaid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The net debt of <span class="companylink">Cinda Real Estate</span>, a state-owned developer that splurged on land during the property boom, for example, increased 57% to $5.1 billion compared with a year ago, as of September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other problem: Mortgage growth has been astronomical over the past year. Homeowners and speculators continue to believe that the government will never let the market crash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This means that at some stage, the government may feel compelled to prop up the market again, just as it did two years ago when the market started sliding. Such expectations could make the up-and-down cycle shorter and shorter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Chinese property isn't different from property everywhere else in the world. Eventually, those who overexpanded during the real-estate boom will have to take their losses.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">January Home Sales Reach Highest Level in a Decade, Realtors Say; Supply of existing homes remains historically low</span>
</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto and Eric Morath </div><div>581 words</div><div>22 February 2017</div><div>11:24</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home sales rose in January to the highest level since February 2007, a sign last year's momentum in the sector extended into 2017 despite a limited supply of properties-for-sale and rising prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of previously owned homes, which account for the vast majority of U.S. sales, increased 3.3% from December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.69 million last month, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Warm weather and slightly lower mortgage rates helped fuel better-than-expected demand. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected home sales to rise 1.1%, following a 2.8% decline last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Buyers are in force in 2017," said Nela Richardson, chief economist at online property brokerage <span class="companylink">Redfin Corp</span>. Ms. Richardson said the firm is seeing the highest demand for homes—as measured by the number of tours buyers are taking and offers they are writing—since January 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventory rose 2.4% at the end of January from the end of December, when supply hit the lowest level[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/existing-home-sales-fell-2-8-in-december-1485270346] since the Realtors association began tracking all types of supply in 1999. Still, inventory still was down 7.1% from a year earlier, which is a more reliable measure because December is historically a slow time for buyers to put homes on the market. At the current sales pace, it would take 3.6 months to exhaust the supply of existing homes on the market, the Realtors said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lack of available properties could put a brake on purchases despite low unemployment and rising incomes supporting demand for homes. "There is tremendous resilience among consumers of wanting to buy a home, but we just don't have homes for a sale," Realtors economist Lawrence Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low inventory is also helping to push up prices. The median sale price rose 7.1% in January from a year earlier, to $228,900. That, combined with higher mortgage rates, made affordability more of a challenge for home buyers last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising mortgage rates are also putting pressure on affordability. Rates for a 30-year mortgage held at 4.15% last week[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/PR-CO-20170216-912554], down slightly from a week earlier but up from about 3.5% before the election, according to mortgage company <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide Insurance, said home-price gains of 3% to 4% is considered sustainable. The current rate of price appreciation "is ultimately not a positive thing because it keeps first-time buyers out of the market," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low inventory is likely to continue to be a challenge throughout the year. U.S. housing starts dropped 2.6% in January[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-private-housing-permits-rose-to-highest-level-in-14-months-1487252243] to a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.246 million, below the revised December rate of 1.279 million, the Commerce Department said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">News Corp</span>, owner of The Wall Street Journal, also operates Realtor.com under license from the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Overall, this is an exceptionally strong way to start the year, and it's clear that demand is likely to continue to be very high as the market enters the spring, even if inventory remains low and affordability suffers somewhat from rising mortgage interest rates," said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Zillow.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rocker Pat Benatar and her guitarist husband Neil "Spyder" Giraldo have sold their Maui home, said co-listing agent Dan Omer of Island Sotheby's International Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple sold their house and surrounding 1.1 acres for $3.1 million after putting it on the market in November for $3.2 million[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/pat-benatars-oceanfront-home-in-hana-maui-goes-on-the-market-1478704759], Mr. Omer said. The oceanfront home is located on the eastern end of Maui outside the sleepy village of Hana, where the couple was married in 1982. Separately, a roughly 1 acre piece of vacant land adjacent to the house the couple had listed for $400,000 sold to a different buyer for the full asking price, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Omer declined to identify the buyers of the house, but said they are a family from the Northwest who plan to use the home as a vacation property. The sale included most of the furniture, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Benatar, whose real name is Patricia Giraldo, and her husband lived full time at the property with their two daughters for about five years until about 2009. They couldn't be reached for comment; Mr. Giraldo said in a previous interview that the couple's touring schedule had caused them to relocate to California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Omer had the listing with colleague Megan Bouhey.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, housing data from the U.S. will offer clues on how a pickup in mortgage rates has affected the market, surveys of purchasing managers will give an early look at how the eurozone economy is holding up in February, and <span class="companylink">the Bank of Korea</span> releases a policy statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MONDAY: Japan, one of the world's top exporters, releases January trade data (Sunday in the U.S.), giving clues about the vibrancy of its economy and the international outlook at the start of the year. Economists expect the island nation to register its first trade deficit in five months, though such a gap wouldn't be atypical. The country's trade balance tends to fall into a deficit in January as New Year's holidays in Japan and China dent exports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TUESDAY: Surveys of purchasing managers at businesses around the eurozone will provide the first indication as to whether the modest recovery extended into February, or if it began to falter amid heightened policy uncertainty both locally and internationally. Economists are looking to the former, expecting the composite purchasing managers index to decline only slightly to 54.3, from 54.4 in January, broadly consistent with an unchanged, quarter-to-quarter economic growth rate of 0.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WEDNESDAY: In the U.S., the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> releases minutes from its Jan. 31-Feb. 1 meeting. The release could provide more clues about the timing of interest-rate increases this year. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen indicated in testimony before Congress this month that a rate increase at the central bank's March policy meeting is in play given signs of rising inflation and a tightening labor market. Meanwhile, the U.S. housing market will get a checkup with the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>'' release of data on existing-home sales for January. The big question is whether a recent rise in mortgage rates[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/a-harsh-reality-is-hitting-the-housing-market-1487191357] is starting to slow the housing market, which has been a source of strength in the world's largest economy in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THURSDAY: In South Korea, <span class="companylink">the Bank of Korea</span> releases a policy statement. Earlier this month, the central banks of South Korea and Australia agreed to expand and extend their currency swap line to boost bilateral trade and enhance financial stability. The South Korean economy has been on guard against potential capital flight since the U.S. tightened monetary policy in December. South Korea has experienced financial crunches twice—in 1997 and 2008—due to sudden foreign capital outflows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FRIDAY: In the U.S., the government releases data on January sales of newly built homes. This gauge of the market is volatile, but it nonetheless could provide more clues about how the housing segment is faring in the face of higher mortgage costs.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. housing starts slid in the first month of 2017, an indication that softness in apartment construction could offset a continued recovery in the single-family construction market this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts dropped 2.6% in January to a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.246 million, below the revised December rate of 1.279 million, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Permits, an indication of how much construction is in the pipeline, rose 4.6% to 1.285 million from the revised December total of 1.228 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family home construction continues to pick up even as apartment construction appears to be tapering off. Single-family construction climbed 1.9% in January, while multifamily construction tumbled 10.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Multifamily construction is at its highest level in decades, as concerns about a glut of new supply at the high end in urban markets is causing developers and banks to pull back. The number of units under construction in buildings with five units or more hit its highest level since September 1974. Much of the apartment construction in recent years has been concentrated in the luxury category.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Multifamily permits rose 23.5% in January over December, indicating that builders are continuing to begin new projects despite concerns of a glut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It does make me a little nervous to see such strong growth again," said Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Labor Nominee</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Donald Trump announced his nomination of Alexander Acosta as Labor secretary and said he would be "tremendous" in the job. Mr. Trump said he spoke with Mr. Acosta about the position earlier on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Acosta has served as dean of Florida International University's law school in Miami since 2009. He was formerly U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida and was appointed by President George W. Bush to serve on the <span class="companylink">National Labor Relations Board</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While U.S. attorney, Mr. Acosta prosecuted high-profile defendants, including Jack Abramoff and Jose Padilla. Mr. Acosta also has served as chairman of U.S. Century Bank in Miami since late 2013. The bank was one of hundreds of banks to take taxpayer money during the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trump's selection of Mr. Acosta comes less than 24 hours after the first selection for that post, Andrew Puzder, withdrew his nomination because of questions about his background and personal life.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. housing starts slid in the first month of 2017, an indication that softness in apartment construction could offset a continued recovery in the single-family construction market this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts dropped 2.6% in January to a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.246 million, below the revised December rate of 1.279 million, the Commerce Department said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Permits, an indication of how much construction is in the pipeline, rose 4.6% to 1.285 million from the revised December total of 1.228 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected starts to remain flat at 1.23 million and building permits to rise 2.5% to 1.24 million. Construction typically begins a month or two after a permit is issued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family home construction continues to pick up even as apartment construction appears to be tapering off. Single-family construction climbed 1.9% in January, while multifamily construction tumbled 10.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Multifamily construction is at its highest level in decades, as concerns about a glut of new supply at the high end in urban markets is causing developers and banks to pull back. The number of units under construction in buildings with five units or more hit its highest level since September 1974. Much of the apartment construction in recent years has been concentrated in the luxury category.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Multifamily permits rose 23.5% in January over December, indicating that builders are continuing to begin new projects despite concerns about a glut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It does make me a little nervous to see such strong growth again," said Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family permits declined 2.7% in January over December, but were up 11.1% compared to the same time last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists saw the uptick in single-family permits as positive, because it indicates that more builders have decided to move forward with projects in the wake of the election. If the growth in permit activity continues that could lead to more new supply as early as later this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If there's one thing that home buyers need this year, it's more homes on the market," Mr. McLaughlin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">January's drop follows a pickup in activity in December, when new starts rose 11.3%. The increase was driven by a rebound in multifamily starts, which rose 53.9%, while single-family starts fell 4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Year-over-year, starts were up 10.5% over last January's number.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While weather was much warmer than usual in January across the country, which is usually a positive for housing starts in the winter, starts in the West plummeted by more than 41%, likely due to the wet weather, said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monthly housing figures are choppy, have a significant margin of error and can be subject to large revisions. But the broader trend has been one of slow growth amid rising demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home construction has been the weakest element of the overall housing recovery. Home prices have already surpassed their previous highs and apartment rents have climbed more than 26% since early 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strength of multifamily housing construction has helped buoy housing starts, even as single-family activity remains well below normal levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have demand for far more housing starts than we are producing," said Mark Boud, chief economist at Metrostudy, which tracks the home building industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Dietz, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders, said he doesn't expect single-family starts to recover to normal levels of around 1.3 million until 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a long road back," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The factors holding back builders range from a shortage of construction laborers to difficulty finding land in desirable locations and regulatory barriers that make it difficult to build affordable homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists are optimistic that single-family housing starts will continue to improve in 2017, as rising wages and a move by younger households toward homeownership help drive up demand. The inventory of single-family homes fell to its lowest level in nearly two decades in the fourth quarter, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People are starting to get frustrated that, heck, there's not a lot of choice in the resale market," said John Burns, a consultant to home builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Republicans have pledged to peel back environmental regulations and President Donald Trump has promised tax cuts and infrastructure spending that could help extend the economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some changes could also hurt the home building industry. An immigration crackdown could exacerbate construction labor shortages and trade measures could result in higher commodity prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builder confidence slipped for the second consecutive month in February, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> said, to a level of 65, down from a recent high of 69 in December. Much of the decrease was due to reduced buyer traffic, though any number over 50 indicates that builders see conditions improving.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Andrew Scurria </div><div>612 words</div><div>16 February 2017</div><div>13:30</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. offshore vessel suppliers are acting irrationally in response to a crippling oversupply of ships, exacerbating the financial strain on the battered sector, Hornbeck Offshore Services Inc. Chief Executive Todd Hornbeck said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a conference call with investors, Mr. Hornbeck said the offshore vessel industry accumulated enough new-generation ships over the past decade to service 50 or more deepwater drilling units in the Gulf of Mexico, where Hornbeck Offshore primarily operates. By the company's estimation, he said there are 24 deepwater units currently working in the Gulf. That's down 33% from last year even as oil prices rallied in the interim, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Clearly there is a structural demand shift going on that we think will require structural supply changes in the market for offshore supply vessels in the Gulf of Mexico and globally," Mr. Hornbeck said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hornbeck posted a fourth-quarter loss of 53 cents a share, compared with a loss of 7 cents a share a year earlier. Quarterly revenue plunged to $41.9 million from $88.7 million a year earlier, while earnings before income, taxes, depreciation and amortization clocked in at $1.1 million, down 93%. Hornbeck stock declined $7.33% to close at $6.45 a share Wednesday. By Thursday afternoon it had plunged another 22.5% to $5 a share, according to FactSet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company had $217 million of cash and hand and a $200 million undrawn line of credit as of December 31, which it projects will be sufficient to fund its operations and debt service through December 31, 2018. Hornbeck owes $1.1 billion in bond debt coming due between 2019 and 2020, according to FactSet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However the company will use "a significant amount of cash during 2017," Mr. Hornbeck said. "The reality is that we do not have enough cash on hand nor the visibility to repay these obligations as they come due."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bonds with a 1.5% coupon that mature in 2019 changed hands on Thursday at 74 cents on the dollar, according to FactSet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notwithstanding oil prices at $50 and $55 per barrel, Mr. Hornbeck said he expected an average of 19 Gulf drilling units were planned to be active during 2017. Even so, he said the number of high-specification vessels available to work there swelled to 194 in 2016 as previous orders rolled in from shipyards. Even with roughly half those vessels idled, Mr. Hornbeck said the market remains oversupplied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"To the extent it is a market, it is not one that operates on the basis of rational business principles because if that were the case, even more vessels would be stacked by other industry participants," Mr. Hornbeck said. "Instead, even cash-strapped competitors are burning what little cash they have to charter vessels at rates below their cash operating costs."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An oil-price rally tied to <span class="companylink">OPEC</span>'s late-November production-cutting agreement has lifted the fortunes of U.S. exploration and production companies, some of which have resumed acquiring assets in low-cost regions like the Permian basin. Reduced global supplies are prompting U.S. producers to ramp up output, but the offshore vessel sector isn't well-positioned[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/tidewater-warns-of-possible-restructuring-1486594299] to benefit from only a modest rise in prices. Offshore drilling is both costlier and riskier than projects in U.S. shale formations and requires a higher price point to be viable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Market sentiment and misplaced hope brought on by improved commodity prices will not fix the structural oversupply of vessels," Mr. Hornbeck said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher interest rates already are taking a toll on the U.S. housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rise in Treasury yields since the presidential election has prompted a pickup in mortgage rates. That has reverberated across a number of housing measures, including mortgage applications and home-builder sentiment. Thursday's data on U.S. housing starts will likely reinforce what is shaping up to be a slow start to the year for housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tracked by the Commerce Department, housing starts measure when construction of a new home begins. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal estimate housing starts were unchanged in January from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.23 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While housing starts in 2016 had their best year since 2007, they remain well below precrisis levels. Roughly 1.17 million housing units were started in 2016, a far cry from the 2005 peak and below the annual average of 1.44 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That slump has occurred even as home prices have recovered to precrisis highs. Surging prices have left many Americans behind, including millennials. Many are still living with their parents or renting, so they haven't benefited from the price increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One explanation is that Americans have been less mobile than at any time in recent decades. The percentage of Americans who moved in the previous year dropped to a record low of 11.2% in 2016, according to the Census Bureau. Much of that is due to millennials staying put. Only 20% of young Americans between ages 25 and 35 said they changed addresses last year, lower than the mobility of the prior four generations when they were in that age range, according to the <span class="companylink">Pew Research Center</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, older people who already have locked in historically low mortgage rates will be more reluctant to move now that rates are rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average 30-year fixed-mortgage rate was 4.24%, up more than half a percentage point since the election, according to Mortgage News Daily. And the case for the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> raising interest rates faster than anticipated only appears to be getting stronger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, mortgage applications for home purchases fell in the week ended Feb. 10 to a 13-week low, according to a weekly survey from the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>, released Wednesday. And the sharp rise in home-builder sentiment immediately after the election has also waned in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home construction, a conspicuous laggard in this recovery, is going to have an even tougher climb.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vietnam's government plans to sell a 49% stake in the country's largest rice-exporting firm later this year as the country speeds up the privatization of state-owned enterprises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government has instructed the company, formally known as Vietnam Southern Food Corp., to sell the stake in an initial public offering slated for June or July this year, said Deputy General Director Le Tho Tri.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We will wait for the auditing result later in February to decide on the amount we target to raise from the IPO," Mr. Tri told The Wall Street Journal.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The IPO plan is part of Vietnam's efforts to speed up its divestment from state-owned enterprises to improve the efficiency of state firms while reducing the government's role. The sales will also fill government coffers as public debt nears the government's mandated ceiling of 65% of gross domestic product. The government announced last month that it plans to privatize around 140 state-owned enterprises either fully or partially by 2020.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mediated settlement enables the 91-year-old to end litigation that capped a long career at AIG in which he built the company into a global powerhouse. Mr. Greenberg ran AIG for nearly 40 years before being pushed out in 2005 as a probe by then-New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer was under way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Greenberg's longtime lawyer, David Boies, said in an interview that, in settling, his client "is not acknowledging anything improper."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York's current attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, issued a news release late Friday with a headline saying Mr. Greenberg "Admits to Initiating, Participating and Approving Two Fraudulent Transactions." Mr. Greenberg admitted to his involvement in the transactions, Mr. Boies says, but not in fraud. He has said he relied on advisers in making the decisions.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The majority of illegal immigrants in the U.S. live in 20 metropolitan areas, with a substantial number in "sanctuary," or immigrant-friendly, cities, according to a study released Thursday by the <span class="companylink">Pew Research Center</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2014, the 20 metropolitan areas with the largest undocumented populations were home to 6.8 million, or 61%, of the estimated 11.1 million in the country. Only 36% of the total U.S. population resided in those areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greater New York, with 1.2 million undocumented immigrants, and metropolitan Los Angeles, with one million, were home to the largest number of people in the U.S. unlawfully.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are among several major metropolitan areas with large undocumented populations, whose mayors have pledged not to cooperate with federal efforts to step up immigration enforcement. Mayors and law-enforcement officials in such cities say rounding up undocumented immigrants in large numbers undermines public safety because the immigrants will be less likely to trust police and report crimes.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">U.S. Postal Service</span> reported a revenue drop for the quarter ended Dec. 31 as a continuing decline in first-class-mail volume and the expiration of a rate increase offset a surge in e-commerce parcels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Postmaster General Megan Brennan said the Postal Service delivered more than 800 million packages during the peak holiday period, up 15% from last year, as more people shopped online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That increase wasn't enough to offset the steady decrease in first-class mail, which logged a 3.3% decline in volume.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the December quarter, net income rose to $1.4 billion from $307 million a year earlier.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes for sale fell to the lowest level in nearly two decades in the fourth quarter, lifting prices and raising concerns that young buyers are being shut out of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of an existing single-family home increased in 89% of metropolitan areas in the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Thursday. In the third quarter, prices rose in 87% of those markets from the same quarter a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sale prices in more than half of the 178 markets included in the report have now reached or surpassed their previous peaks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The inability for supply to catch up with this demand drove prices higher and continued to put a tight affordability squeeze on those trying to reach the market," said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A major factor driving price gains is a worsening inventory shortage. At the end of the fourth quarter, there were 1.65 million homes available for sale, 6.3% less than the same quarter a year earlier and the lowest level since <span class="companylink">NAR</span> began tracking the supply of all housing types in 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average inventory during the fourth quarter was 3.9 months, down from 4.6 months a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, 17% of metro areas experienced double-digit increases in the fourth quarter from the same period a year earlier, up from 14% in the third quarter. Those included Portland, Ore., as well as Orlando, Nashville, Memphis and Cincinnati.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The priciest housing markets in the fourth quarter were concentrated in California, led by the San Jose metro area, where the median sale price of an existing single-family home was more than $1 million, followed by San Francisco, Anaheim and Honolulu.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The least expensive metro area was Youngstown, Ohio, where the median price was $87,600, followed by Decatur, Ill., and Cumberland, Md.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, the median sale price of an existing single-family home in the fourth quarter was $235,000, up 5.7% from the fourth quarter of 2015.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Anna Riley, a Seattle-area real-estate agent, held an open house for a new $2.3 million listing in the tony city of Bellevue late last month, the pool of prospective buyers was different from the usual assortment of tech magnates, sports stars and chief executives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twenty groups of buyers visited the property in the Seattle metro area -- and all of them were Chinese.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Every single one," said Ms. Riley, an agent at Windermere Real Estate, noting that Asian investors had typically, before last year, accounted for about a quarter of the firm's prospective buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese real-estate buyers are suddenly descending on the Seattle region. Some are lured by perceptions the coastal city is a bargain, others by warm memories of the 2013 Chinese film "Finding Mr. Right," which put Seattle on the pop-culture radar there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest draw, though, might be the fact that it isn't Vancouver. In August, the Canadian province of British Columbia imposed a 15% tax on foreign investment in the city, which until recently was a popular destination for Chinese. The tax applies to anyone who isn't a citizen or permanent resident of Canada and buys a home in metro Vancouver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The provincial government says the tax policy is aimed at making homes in the city more affordable for local residents, who have seen prices soar by nearly 50% over the past three years. The city of Vancouver also introduced a separate vacancy tax of 1% on the assessed value of an empty property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moves have had a chilling effect. Web searches in China for Vancouver properties dropped 37% in December, compared with a year earlier, according to Juwai.com, an online real-estate portal that targets Chinese home seekers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seattle, by contrast, is red hot. Searches originating in China for Seattle properties jumped 125% year-to-year in November, after increasing 71% in October, according to Juwai. They rose 1.8% in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kyle Moss, a real-estate agent at Redfin, said he received a call from a Chinese man within 72 hours of the tax passing who said he represented 20 families interested in buying real estate in Seattle. Mr. Moss said that for some buyers the appeal is being near family and friends in Vancouver, 120 miles away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is too early to quantify the effect of Chinese interest on Seattle's home sales, and no one tracks the ethnicities of buyers in particular markets. But the sudden surge in interest in Seattle comes at a time when it already ranks among the nation's hottest real-estate markets. It led the U.S. in home-price growth in November, according to a report released Tuesday by S&amp;P <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> Case-Shiller Indices, which found prices there increased by more than 10% from the same month in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some places that have been favorites for Chinese in recent years -- including London, Australia and, most recently, New York -- are rolling out policies that discourage foreign purchasers. In the U.K. in late 2014, the added tax burden of buying homes valued at more than GBP 937,000, or $1.17 million at current exchange rates, went up on a sliding scale, rising to a 12% tax on the portion of a sale over GBP 1.5 million. In April, an additional 3% was tacked on to the sale price of homes for foreign buyers or for those renting out their properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike O'Brien, a Seattle City Council member, said he is exploring measures, including a vacancy tax, to combat another trend that has irked Vancouver residents: foreign investors who leave homes vacant and untended. "It baffles me that people would buy real estate here and not fill it up," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stella Guo, a third-year university student from China, and her family recently purchased two waterfront properties in Seattle for more than $5 million each. The family owns a Chinese development company and is looking at building projects in the northwestern U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Guo, who attends college in Arizona, said she doesn't plan to live in Seattle full-time but wanted a place for her and her family to relax on vacation and was drawn to Seattle's temperate climate, according to answers to emailed questions provided by her real-estate agent, Robert Pong, senior global real-estate adviser at Realogics Sotheby's International Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lili Shang, an agent at the Seattle-area agency, said she is seeing many Chinese families and investors looking to sell property in Vancouver and move their money to Seattle because of the tax. "I think people realize that Vancouver is no more a fun place to do investments," she said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most expensive housing market in the world has reached unsustainable heights. The mysterious disappearance of a mainland Chinese-born billionaire there could give it a slight push toward the edge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local media reports emerged last week speculating that Chinese law-enforcement agents had abducted Xiao Jianhua, a finance tycoon who resides in Hong Kong. Mr. Xiao, a well-connected businessman, is one of the several prominent financial figures who have gone missing since China's stock-market crash two years ago. Many wealthy mainlanders, like Mr. Xiao, have moved money to Hong Kong to escape Beijing's scrutiny. His case indicates that the semiautonomous Chinese city, which has its own legal system, is no haven for them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That matters because so much of the demand for housing in Hong Kong is driven by mainlanders. Surely escaping prosecution is only one motivation for mainlanders to buy in Hong Kong. But it shouldn't be underestimated, especially for the high end of the market, where they have an outsize impact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transaction volume in Hong Kong's real-estate market has dried up in recent years so small swings in demand can move prices quickly. Property prices in Hong Kong fell in late 2015 and were rescued only by a jump in mainland buyers. That extra boost could disappear again, especially as Beijing steps up its efforts to stem capital outflows. Moves on people like Mr. Xiao won't help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising interest rates also loom. Interest rates in Hong Kong, whose currency is pegged to the U.S. dollar, tend to move in tandem with the rates in the U.S. Two to three rate increases this year could push mortgage rates above rental yields and inflation, notes <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>. Supply is also rising as the government has pushed aggressively to sell more land in the past three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower transaction volume -- and falling prices -- would be bad for Hong Kong's developers including <span class="companylink">Sun Hung Kai Properties</span>, the world's largest developer by market value, and <span class="companylink">Cheung Kong Property</span>. Both companies' share prices have stayed buoyant despite the risks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hong Kong as a haven for mainland cash appears to be under threat.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Peter Grant   </div><div>1053 words</div><div>8 February 2017</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some prominent real-estate investors are reducing their holdings and getting more selective about new deals, in a sign that the eight-year bull market for U.S. commercial property may be coming to a close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asset managers at pension funds and endowments, as well as private-equity firms and other big investors, are throttling back on new acquisitions, selling more assets and shifting to less risky strategies as a way to protect against potential losses in a downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additional selling could put stress on the market because demand for property has started to flag. Commercial real estate deal volume decreased by $58.3 billion, or 11%, in 2016, the first annual decrease since 2009, according to data firm <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, a sign that investor appetite is waning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Caution among investors in the $11 trillion U.S. commercial-property sector is being driven by lofty prices, the length of the market cycle so far and the recent rise in interest rates, which makes bonds look more attractive compared with commercial property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, developers are adding new supply of some property types at the fastest rate since the recovery began.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few investors predict a crash along the lines of the 2008 downturn because debt levels aren't nearly as high and the economy continues to show signs of strength.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But certain property types are weakening. Under siege by online shopping, retail space saw "signs of a correction" last year with 30 metropolitan areas showing an increase in vacancy over 2015, according to <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>., a data firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the office market, the largest commercial real-estate sector in terms of value, tenants occupied an additional 38.5 million square feet in 2016, thanks to the expanding economy, Reis said. But that was down from 44.5 million square feet of absorption in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors that have picked up the pace of selling to lock in profits include private-equity firm <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span>, real estate giant <span class="companylink">Brookfield Asset Management</span>, <span class="companylink">United Parcel Service Inc</span>.'s pension trust and <span class="companylink">Harvard Management Co</span>., which manages <span class="companylink">Harvard University</span>'s endowment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When these big investors do buy, they are focusing more on niche properties such as self-storage warehouses and biomedical facilities, which haven't seen the sharp price rise of trophy office buildings and rental apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We definitely have a risk-off mentality," said Judy McMahan, a portfolio manager for UPS's $32 billion pension trust. "We're being careful."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pension trust sold more property than it bought last year, and its new acquisitions included senior housing and industrial space in the U.K., Ms. McMahan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brookfield also increased the pace of its selling, unloading about $3 billion in property in 2016 compared with about half that much in 2015. The firm is using the capital to buy niche property types that haven't seen such sharp increases in pricing, like self-storage facilities and student housing in the U.K.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company recently put on the block a 49% stake in its sprawling Brookfield Place complex in Manhattan. The complex just finished overhauling its retail space and filling the 2.5 million square feet of office space emptied in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We think now is an opportune time to reduce some of our exposure to that asset," said Brian Kingston, Brookfield senior managing partner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2009, investors have been handsomely rewarded for purchases of office buildings, warehouses, apartment buildings and other commercial property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks to low interest rates and the improving U.S. economy, a valuation index published by <span class="companylink">Green Street Advisors</span> has increased 107% since hitting its crash-era low in May 2009. But that growth is slowing. The Green Street index, which focuses on top-quality U.S. commercial property owned by real-estate investment trusts, has stayed flat since mid-2016, according to Green Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another closely followed metric -- an index compiled by the <span class="companylink">National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries</span> -- showed total returns from commercial real estate rising 9.2% in the year ended Sept. 30, 2016, a sharp decline from 13.5% for the 12 months ended in the third quarter of 2015 and growth ranging from 11% to 14% in each of the previous five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fund investors are pulling back as well. Quarterly distributions and redemptions from open-ended funds that buy low-risk properties, a popular investment vehicle among institutional investors, doubled during the first nine months of 2016, after ticking up just 11% in 2015, according to the council.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the bull market has been fueled by low interest rates, which encouraged investors to forsake bonds and stretch for more yield. But rates have jumped since Election Day. Real-estate investment trusts took the first hit, with equity REITs declining 2.9% in the fourth quarter of last year compared with a gain of 5.3% for the S&amp;P 500, according to Green Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year through Monday, equity REITs have had a total return of 0.38%, compared with 1.9% for the S&amp;P 500, Green Street said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently, the rise in property values was fueled by developers keeping new supply in check. But that, too, is beginning to change with certain property types. For example, more than 378,000 new apartments are expected to be completed across the country this year, almost 35% more than the 20-year average, according to real estate tracker Axiometrics Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private investors say the real estate they are chasing these days often is either less risky or properties that can be improved and sold quickly, rather than those -- like developments -- that might not be finished until the economy is well into the next down cycle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, private-equity giant <span class="companylink">KKR &amp; Co</span>. moved quickly to find a buyer last year after it purchased the landmark Sullivan Center in the Chicago Loop for $267 million. A few months after the deal closed, <span class="companylink">KKR</span> sold the retail portion of the 946,000-square-foot building to <span class="companylink">Acadia Realty Trust</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Given we are in the later stage of the real estate cycle, we have been focused on business plans that require less time to create value," said Chris Lee, co-head of real estate credit at <span class="companylink">KKR</span>.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An investment firm that specializes in industrial real estate has sold a $1.07 billion collection of smaller urban industrial properties, tapping into investors' desire for property tied to online retail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">DRA Advisors LLC</span>, a New York-based private-equity firm that specializes in real estate, purchased the portfolio that includes 19.8 million square feet of industrial space spread across 21 U.S. markets including Dallas, Chicago and Atlanta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seller, Boston-based <span class="companylink">Cabot Properties Inc</span>., had been assembling the portfolio since 2005, said Franz Colloredo-Mansfeld, Cabot's chief executive, in a statement announcing the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale comes as the market for industrial property is heating up. Occupancy and rents have been rising for warehouses and distribution centers as tenant demand increases, particularly from internet retail businesses that need distribution space. Manufacturing space also has benefited from the improving U.S. economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal also shows how some investors are seeking niche assets as prices of other types of commercial property have soared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The net income from the portfolio comes to about 6.5% of its price, a yield about 1 percentage point lower than what it would have been if the portfolio were sold two years ago, according to people familiar with the matter and market experts. Like bond yields, the yields on property, known as capitalization rates, fall as prices rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise of online shopping first benefited massive distribution facilities outside of cities. More recently, internet retailers such as <span class="companylink">Amazon.com Inc</span>. have been filling space in smaller urban warehouses as they look for distribution points closer to their customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The portfolio Cabot sold to DRA consisted of urban properties with an average size of about 110,000 square feet. These property types -- often known as infill -- have generally sold at higher capitalization rates than bigger facilities because they tend to be older and populated with smaller tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the difference in price has been narrowing. Today infill properties trade at about 1 percentage point above larger, more modern facilities, according to Eric Frankel, analyst at real-estate research and consulting firm <span class="companylink">Green Street Advisors</span>. He estimated the spread three to four years ago was between 1.5 and 2 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cabot's ability to sell the entire portfolio in one deal "is significant in itself," said Mr. Frankel. "Four years ago, this probably wouldn't have traded. The spread would have been too wide, or the seller would have said: 'No, I'll just break it up and sell it in pieces.'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Cabot portfolio is leased to more than 500 tenants and has a 6% vacancy rate. The national availability rate for industrial property has fallen every quarter since the third quarter of 2010 and stood at 8.2% in the fourth quarter of 2016, according to <span class="companylink">CBRE Group Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rents, meanwhile, have risen. The average asking rent was $6.58 a square foot at the end of last year, up 6.3% compared with 2015, CBRE said. Asking rents have increased for 12 consecutive quarters, according to CBRE.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commercial-real-estate market has seen numerous high-profile industrial-real-estate deals in the last 12 months. Others include <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span>'s deal last fall to pay $1.5 billion for a portfolio of mostly West Coast industrial property from <span class="companylink">LBA Realty LLC</span>, of Irvine, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Founded in 1986, Cabot Properties specializes in industrial property and has invested $7 billion in warehouses. The company had an initial public offering as a real-estate investment trust in 1998. Three years later, Cabot Industrial Trust was acquired by a venture of the <span class="companylink">California Public Employees' Retirement System</span> and asset manager RREEF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently Cabot has accumulated industrial properties through private funds. In 2013, <span class="companylink">Liberty Property Trust</span> purchased one of its funds for $1.47 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also founded in 1986, DRA Advisors has more than $10 billion of assets under management. Eastdil Secured and <span class="companylink">Cushman &amp; Wakefield</span> represented Cabot in the deal.</p>

</div><div class="author">By John Coumarianos   </div><div>971 words</div><div>6 February 2017</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>R5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many investors have reaped hefty returns from real-estate funds in recent years, but there are signs that the party may be winding down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's because the prices of buildings -- and the stocks of the companies that own income-producing real estate (known as real-estate investment trusts, or REITs) -- are high. Commercial property prices have risen so much since the financial crisis that investors already have captured much of the future profits that real estate likely will deliver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just how good was the run? Investors in Vanguard REIT Index Fund (VGSIX), for example, achieved 15.5% annualized returns from 2009 through 2016. Over that same time, the fund's assets swelled above $60 billion from less than $10 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the help of Research Affiliates, a Newport Beach, Calif., investment firm, we came up with a way to estimate the likely future returns of REITs. The formula starts with dividend yield, adjusts it for property-maintenance costs, and then factors in an element of price, or how properties are trading relative to their history. Based on that formula, we predict REIT returns over the next decade won't be nearly as robust as they have been over the past five years. Here is a closer look:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. First, dividend yield</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate investors estimating future returns of a commercial property start with the current rent minus basic expenses such as repairs, insurance, and taxes. That number -- often called net operating income by real-estate pros -- is the current profit properties are delivering to investors. Investors typically consider net operating income in relation to the price of property to arrive at what's called a capitalization rate -- or a rough estimate of an investor's return on investment from a property or a portfolio of properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Research Affiliates paper by Michael Aked and Jim Masturzo uses a capitalization rate or income per unit of price as the first component of return. In an interview, Messrs. Aked and Masturzo said investors in REITs or REIT mutual funds could simply substitute dividend yield for the capitalization rate as the first input of the return model. (A REIT's dividend yield is typically covered by the cash remaining after collecting rent and paying basic expenses.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Research Affiliates, the capitalization rate of commercial real estate has been falling, from 7%-8% in the 1980s and 1990s to 5.5% in the past five years. The Research Affiliates model used 4.6% for current profit when it was published in August 2016. The current dividend yield of U.S. REIT indexes is around 4%, according to <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. Maintenance costs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After current profit, the second component of the model is the capital required to maintain properties over the longer haul. These aren't day-to-day repairs but rather bigger projects that are more expensive and necessary to maintain the quality of the property. They include replacing roofs and refurbishing kitchens and bathrooms, among other things. Messrs. Aked and Masturzo argue that landlords have spent 2% of the value of their property a year to maintain the property at "constant quality," or to keep it in the condition it was when first completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Letting the property deteriorate, maintaining it only at "minimum quality," can boost profit at first, but ultimately erodes the property's value and future profitability. Alternatively, maintaining property at "current quality" of technology, amenities and building standards, as opposed the standards of its own completion date, drains too much cost that can't be recouped in big enough rent increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Different property types may require different levels of expenditure. REIT funds own a mixture of property types, making the 2% annual long-term "constant quality" maintenance cost reasonable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means REIT investors should cut the roughly 4% dividend yield by 2 percentage points, leaving a 2% annualized return before factoring in the third element of the model.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. Price change</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The third component of the forecast is the constant-quality price change. Research Affiliates estimates that constant-quality prices are 20% above their long-term trend, which is a rough proxy for replacement cost, the amount for which a builder would build and sell a building. If that 20% premium shrinks, it could cut into the next decade's already paltry 2% annualized real return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some good news for investors is that developers haven't been active in creating new supply. Messrs. Aked and Masturzo say credit is tightening. Without credit flowing freely and new development occurring, prices of commercial real estate can remain high and investors can keep the expected 2% real return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morris Chen, who heads commercial mortgage-backed securities and commercial real estate at <span class="companylink">DoubleLine Capital</span>, says money-center bank lending for new projects has been tepid. He, too, expects lower commercial-property returns over the next decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, it's possible that new development activity could send real prices down by around 2% a year over the next decade, in which case REIT investors wouldn't make any real return. Either way, investors almost certainly won't achieve anything like the 15% annualized returns domestic REITs have delivered since 2009. Investors may want to continue holding a small allocation in REITs, but those who have piled into the sector with gusto recently, hoping for continued torrid returns, should lower their expectations.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices climbed strongly in November, as price growth showed no signs of slowing even after mortgage rates began to tick up during the month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> Case-Shiller Indices covering the entire nation rose 5.6% in the 12 months ended in November, up slightly from the revised 5.5% year-over-year increase reported in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-city index gained 4.5% over the year, up from 4.3% in October and the 20-city index gained 5.3% year-over-year, up from a 5.1% increase in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hottest markets in the country remain concentrated in the Northwest, as many buyers priced out of the Silicon Valley area flee to secondary tech hubs. Seattle led the way with a 10.4% increase, Portland reported a 10.1% year-over-year gain and Denver had an 8.7% annual increase in home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices set a record in September and have continued climbing by more than 5% year-over-year since then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"One can argue that housing has recovered from the boom-bust cycle that began a dozen years ago," said David Blitzer, managing director at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The volume of sales has cooled in recent months, as rising mortgage rates have collided with higher prices and a shortage of inventory. Purchases of previously owned homes slid 2.8% in December from a month earlier, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said last week. U.S. new-home sales dropped by 10.4% in December, the Commerce Department said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Case-Shiller offers a lagging indicator of the housing market and November's numbers reflect only the beginning of a sharp increase in mortgage rates that began around the election in November. Average rates for 30-year fixed mortgages rose from roughly 3.5% around Election Day to 4.32% at the end of December, according to mortgage company <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. In the past week they averaged 4.19%, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher mortgage rates tend to put a damper on price growth because they drive up the monthly cost of a mortgage. That combined with prices that have risen faster than incomes could pose challenges to the market this year. Cooling rent growth also could put downward pressure on home prices as purchases begin to look less attractive than renting. Developers, meanwhile, could shift more to single-family building, easing supply pressures.</p>

Blackstone Group's Invitation Homes Prices IPO at $20 a Share; The real-estate investment trust raises $1.54 billion, the largest U.S.-listed IPO in more than a year</span>
</div><div class="author">By Corrie Driebusch and Ryan Dezember </div><div>570 words</div><div>31 January 2017</div><div>18:55</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span> took a step toward cashing in its big bet on housing Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The private-equity giant's <span class="companylink">Invitation Homes</span> Inc. raised $1.54 billion in its initial public offering late Tuesday, according to two people familiar with the deal. The real-estate investment trust sold 77 million shares at $20 apiece in its IPO, according to the people, making it the largest U.S.-listed IPO in more than a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Invitation Homes</span> is the end result of the biggest homebuying spree in history. Starting in 2012 with a home in Phoenix, Blackstone spent some $10 billion buying and fixing up homes to rent. For stretches, the firm spent $150 million a week on foreclosed homes, often buying them sight unseen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company now owns and rents 48,431 houses in 13 markets, from Seattle to south Florida, according to Invitation's offering document. <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span> didn't plan to sell any of its roughly 70% stake in the IPO, the filing said, but the listing will enable it to begin cashing out of its investment in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The IPO is also a test of investors' interest in the rental-home business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Invitation is part of a broader bet on Wall Street that homeownership will remain out of reach for many Americans. Invitation will join its two largest rental-home rivals on the stock market. Shares of <span class="companylink">American Homes 4 Rent</span> and <span class="companylink">Colony Starwood Homes</span> debuted in recent years to tepid demand but surged last year as the homeownership rate fell to its lowest level in at least 50 years, according to <span class="companylink">U.S. Census Bureau</span> data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeownership has declined since the housing crisis amid stricter lending standards, mounting student debt and potential buyers whose savings and credit diminished during the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some investors have questioned whether the growth of Invitation and its rivals will be limited now that the foreclosure crisis is over and home prices in many markets have exceeded their 2006 highs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, Invitation won an important endorsement from <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> when the government-controlled mortgage-finance company said it would guarantee as much as $1 billion of the company's debt, a development that will likely mean cheaper borrowing costs for Invitation and potentially its rivals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Invitation's stock offering also comes as the beleaguered U.S.-IPO market is showing signs of a resurgence. The company's deal value makes Invitation the largest IPO since <span class="companylink">First Data Corp</span>. raised $2.8 billion in October 2015, according to Dealogic data. Invitation had planned to sell 77 million shares at $18 to $21 apiece, according to a regulatory filing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year was the slowest year for IPOs since 2003 in terms of money raised, according to Dealogic. Through Monday night, U.S.-listed IPOs raised roughly $2.8 billion in January, Dealogic data show. Last year, there were no IPOs in the first month of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Invitation will trade on the <span class="companylink">New York Stock Exchange</span> under the ticker INVH, according to a regulatory filing. <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank AG</span> and <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co</span>. are leading the deal.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market remained steady at the end of last year despite higher mortgage rates, according to an early indicator of home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending home sales, which measure how many homes went under contract, rose 1.6% from a month earlier to an index of 109 in December, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Monday.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun warns that inventory remains tight and the market's latest gains likely won't be sustained without additional homes on the market, particularly at the lower-priced end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The main story line in the early months of 2017 will be if supply can meaningfully increase to keep price growth at a moderate enough level for households to absorb higher borrowing costs," Mr. Yun said in a statement.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales posted a steep decline in December, an indication that affordability challenges are beginning to cut into demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of newly built, single-family houses, which account for a small share of overall U.S. home sales, decreased 10.4% from November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 536,000 last month, the Commerce Department said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was the slowest monthly sales pace since February and the steepest one-month drop since March 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop "was a shocker," said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide Insurance. He said home sales were often volatile in the winter months because of weather, however, and he still expects new-home sales to rise in 2017. Data on new-home sales generally can be imprecise from month to month. December's 10.4% sales decrease came with a margin of error of 12.2 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, an estimated 563,000 new homes were sold in 2016, up 12.2% from a year earlier and the fifth straight year of sales growth.

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto and Ben Leubsdorf </div><div>657 words</div><div>26 January 2017</div><div>10:57</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales posted a steep decline in December, an indication that affordability challenges are beginning to cut into demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of newly built, single-family houses, which account for a small share of overall U.S. home sales, decreased 10.4% from November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 536,000 last month, the Commerce Department said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was the slowest monthly sales pace since February and the steepest one-month drop since March 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected new home sales to decline 1.5%, to 583,000 sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop "was a shocker," said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide Insurance. He said home sales are often volatile in the winter months because of weather, however, and he still expects new-home sales to rise in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data on new-home sales generally can be imprecise from month to month[http://blogs.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/economics/2014/10/24/new-home-sales-rose-last-month-or-maybe-they-fell-we-dont-really-know/]. December's 10.4% sales decrease came with a margin of error of 12 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, an estimated 563,000 new homes were sold in 2016, up 12.2% from a year earlier and the fifth straight year of sales growth. The annual figure indicates broad improvement in the market, even if sales of new homes remain well below where they were during the housing boom of the 2000s, when they topped 1 million a year for four years running.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales represented only about 10% of all home sales last year, which is well below the prerecession average of 16%, according to Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist at housing-tracker <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>. More home construction would bring relief to buyers struggling with low inventory of homes for sale. The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Tuesday the inventory of existing homes for sale was at the lowest level since the group began tracking such data in 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home buyers are facing headwinds from higher mortgage rates and uncertainty about tax policy, but low existing inventory, near full employment, and rising wages are tailwinds that will continue to push new home sales higher in the year ahead," Mr. McLaughlin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists expect new home sales to continue to increase this year as builders step up construction of single-family homes. Housing starts rose 11.3% in December[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/housing-starts-jumped-in-december-capping-best-year-since-2007-1484835917] to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.23 million, the Commerce Department said last Thursday. Overall last year single-family starts were up 9.3% in 2016, but construction of buildings with five or more units fell 3.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One factor holding back demand is that land, construction and regulatory costs have driven up prices for finished single-family homes beyond what many families can afford. The median sales price of a newly built home was $322,500 in 2016, up from $288,900 a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising mortgage rates are expected to make the cost of buying a home this year even higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average rates for 30-year fixed mortgages rose from roughly 3.5% around Election Day to 4.32% at the end of December, according to mortgage company <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. In the past week they averaged 4.19%, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Tuesday that sales of existing homes fell 2.8% in December[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/existing-home-sales-fell-2-8-in-december-1485270346], propelled by the lack of homes for sale, higher mortgage rates and rising prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The worrisome scenario is that the run-up in mortgage rates over the past few months has taken a chunk out of demand," said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities. Mr. Stanley said it is too early to tell if rates or typical seasonal volatility are the cause of the December drop.</p>

PulteGroup Revenue Jumps Amid Rise in Housing Starts; Closings rose 9% to 6,197 homes in the quarter</span>
</div><div class="author">By Joshua Jamerson </div><div>300 words</div><div>26 January 2017</div><div>09:06</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builder PulteGroup Inc. reported a 21% surge in revenue in the latest quarter on rising home sales in a resurgent housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares rose 2.3% to $20.90 in premarket trading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report from Atlanta-based Pulte, one of the nation's largest home builders, comes after the government last week reported that U.S. housing starts [http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/housing-starts-jumped-in-december-capping-best-year-since-2007-1484835917]hit their highest level in nine years in 2016, when an estimated 1.17 million housing units were started, up nearly 5% from 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We believe that continued favorable trends in the economy, job growth, demographics and consumer confidence can more than offset the impact of modestly higher rates, allowing the housing recovery to continue at a steady pace," Chief Executive Ryan Marshall said in prepared remarks Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. builders remain highly confident about the market for newly built single-family homes, but their optimism slipped in January from December, when the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>'s housing-market index hit the highest level in more than a decade the prior month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the fourth quarter, <span class="companylink">PulteGroup</span> reported closings rose 9% to 6,197 homes, with average sales price up 11% to $391,000. Unit backlog increased 10% to 7,422 homes, with the value of the backlog climbing 20% to $2.9 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, <span class="companylink">PulteGroup</span> reported a profit of $273.2 million, or 83 cents a share, compared with $228.3 million, or 64 cents a share, a year prior. Revenue grew to $2.49 billion from $2.06 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts, polled by <span class="companylink">Thomson Reuters</span>, expected 31 cents a share on $1.74 billion in revenue.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Hamptons</span>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Market Slows Down, but Some Big Sales</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite a few hugely expensive waterfront mansion sales, the <span class="companylink">Hamptons</span> real estate market was stuck in the doldrums last year, market reports show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a <span class="companylink">Hamptons</span> house last year slipped 5.3% from 2015, while the number of sales was down 13.7%, according to data compiled by appraiser Jonathan Miller for brokerage <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a house or condominium in the <span class="companylink">Hamptons</span> was $900,000, down from $950,000 in 2015, and below the peak of $975,000 set in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers said the luxury market was particularly weak in 2016, despite some trophy sales that reflected the last gasp of a stronger market that surged at the end of 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Softness at the top continues," Mr. Miller said. There is "too much over-priced inventory -- and it is rising."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The top transaction of the year was the $109.8 million sale of three parcels on Lily Pond Lane in East Hampton by Scott Bommer, the hedge fund manager. Mr. Bommer had paid $93.9 million for the properties several years earlier. The buyer, brokers said, was Michael S. Smith, a natural gas executive and investor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second-most-expensive sale was waterfront home just down the street at 199 Lily Pond Lane. The price was $70 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the fourth quarter, the median price of a luxury home, defined as the top 10% of the market, was weak. The report put the average luxury sale price at $7.06 million, down 17% from the same quarter in 2015. The median price was down 6.4% to $5.85 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast to the <span class="companylink">Hamptons</span>, sales activity was strong on the North Fork of Long Island, a lower-priced second-home market. The median price of $543,000 for 2016 was up 6.5% from 2015, while sales were up 7.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within the <span class="companylink">Hamptons</span> market, sales and prices strengthened on Shelter Island, with the median price of $920,000, up 15.3% from 2015, according to a market report by Brown Harris Stevens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across Long Island as a whole, the median sale price was $388,850, up 2.9% from the previous year but down 10.4% from 2007, according to <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Nassau County, which is more expensive and a shorter commuting distance from Manhattan and Brooklyn, prices were up 5.2% for the year and inventory was down. But prices remain 5.7% below the peak level in 2006. The median price was $462,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Suffolk County the recovery lagged, and inventory swelled by 32.1% in 2016. The median price of $325,000 was 1.6% above the 2015 level, but 18.8% below the peak price in 2006, the report found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brooklyn Heights</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deal for a Home Listed at $16 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of two Brooklyn townhouses tied for the most expensive listings in the borough, at $16 million, has gone into contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The newly renovated one-family townhouse at 27 Monroe Place in Brooklyn Heights was listed as in contract in a broker listing system tracked by real estate data site StreetEasy.com, but the contract price wasn't disclosed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It continues a trend in which gut renovations of older houses that allow wealthy buyers to move in immediately command top dollar in many prime New York neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn't clear if the sale would set a record for a Brooklyn townhouse. The previous record was set in May 2015, with the $15.5 million sale of a four-story carriage house at 177 Pacific St. in Cobble Hill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The five-story, 26-foot-wide house on Monroe Place was purchased by <span class="companylink">Kushner Cos</span>. from Brooklyn Law School in 2014 for $7.4 million. It was converted into a single family home with an elevator, five bedrooms, six baths and three powder rooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, Jared Kushner, the son-in-law and adviser to President Donald Trump, was the chief executive of <span class="companylink">Kushner Cos</span>., but has since stepped down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Cornell and Leslie Marshall of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span> had the listing. Mr. Cornell said he was unable to discuss the deal under the terms of a nondisclosure agreement.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fell 2.8% Last Month</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home sales slid in December, a sign that rising prices and higher mortgage rates are taking a bite out of the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of previously owned homes, which account for the vast majority of U.S. sales, declined 2.8% from November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.49 million last month, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Tuesday.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The monthly decline capped the strongest year for housing since the peak of the real-estate boom a decade ago, and suggests it might be difficult to sustain the momentum in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sale price rose 4% in December from a year earlier, to $232,200. That, combined with an increase in mortgage rates, made affordability more of a challenge for home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates jumped to 4.32% by the end of December from 3.5% in early November, according to mortgage company <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flint's water system no longer has levels of lead exceeding the federal limit, a key finding that Michigan environmental officials said Tuesday was good news for a city whose 100,000 residents have been grappling with the man-made water crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 90th percentile of lead concentrations in Flint was 12 parts per billion from July through December, below the "action level" of 15 ppb, according to a letter from the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality to Flint's mayor. It was 20 ppb in the prior six-month period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residents, whose mistrust in government remains high nearly three years after a fateful switch of Flint's water source in April 2014 while the city was under state management, are being told to continue using faucet filters or bottled water because a mass replacement of pipes could increase lead levels in individual houses. The replacement of the lines is expected to take years.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home sales slid in December, a sign that rising prices and higher mortgage rates are taking a bite out of the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of previously owned homes, which account for the vast majority of U.S. sales, declined 2.8% from November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.49 million last month, the National Association of Realtors said[https://www.nar.realtor/topics/existing-home-sales] Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected home sales to decline 1.8%, following three straight months of rising sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The monthly decline capped the strongest year for housing since the peak of the real-estate boom a decade ago, and suggests it might be difficult to sustain the momentum in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Solid job creation throughout 2016 and exceptionally low mortgage rates translated into a good year for the housing market," said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors. "However, higher mortgage rates and home prices combined with record low inventory levels stunted sales in much of the country in December."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sale price rose 4% in December from a year earlier, to $232,200. That, combined with an increase in mortgage rates, made affordability more of a challenge for home buyers last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates jumped to 4.32% by the end of December from 3.5% in early November, according to mortgage company <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. Rates have since fallen to 4.09%, though economists expect them to climb to around 4.5% this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Zillow, said rising rates prompted some buyers to rush to lock in their purchases in November before rates increased even further, taking a bite out of December's sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Gudell said she expects higher mortgage rates to have a limited impact in most markets this year. But "as rates continue to rise, we'll see some of the bigger impacts in very expensive metros," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists expected the housing market to slow in 2016 because prices have been rising faster than income for several years, making it difficult for new buyers to enter the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, the housing market turned in a strong performance, with most economists expecting slow improvement in 2017, thanks in part to rising wages. Existing home sales clocked in at 5.45 million for 2016, up from the 5.25 million logged in 2015 but well below the peak of the boom in 2006, when they hit 6.48 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Housing starts, meanwhile, notched their strongest year since 2007[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/housing-starts-jumped-in-december-capping-best-year-since-2007-1484835917], the Commerce Department said Thursday, but remain about 38% below the 50-year average when accounting for population growth. Tight supply remains a concern heading into 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventory dropped 11% at the end of December to the lowest level since the <span class="companylink">NAR</span> began tracking all types of supply in 1999. At the current sales pace, it would take 3.6 months to exhaust the supply of existing homes on the market, the <span class="companylink">NAR</span> said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in prices and mortgage rates didn't have a significant impact on first-time buyers, who made up 32% of purchasers during the month, identical to the same period last year. First-time buyers averaged 32% of all buyers in 2016, compared with 30% in 2015, <span class="companylink">NAR</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nela Richardson, chief economist for real-estate brokerage Redfin, said younger buyers aren't being put off much by higher rates but rather by tight inventories of affordable housing. The number of new listings declined 27% in December compared with a month earlier and 5% compared with last year, according to Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We enter 2017 in a big [inventory] hole," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales in December rose 0.7% compared with the same month a year earlier. The weak annual change partly reflects a strong December last year due to new federal mortgages rules delaying some November closings by a few weeks.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Candace Taylor   </div><div>570 words</div><div>20 January 2017</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The marketing of a wildly elaborate Los Angeles spec house, which at $250 million is now the highest priced home in the country, will test the upper limits of ultra-luxury real-estate development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fully furnished home is the brainchild of Bruce Makowsky, who made a fortune selling handbags and turned to buying and selling luxury real-estate about six years ago. Although demand for high-end properties has been slowing, Mr. Makowsky argued that is his home will be tapping into a new, as-of-yet undiscovered market of billionaire buyers looking for the level of service found on a mega-yacht.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"To me it doesn't make sense that somebody spends $250 million on a boat where they spend eight weeks a year, but they're living in a $30 or $40 million house," said Mr. Makowsky, who in late 2014 sold a Beverly Hills spec home to Markus "Notch" Persson, developer of the computer game Minecraft, for $70 million. One reason, Mr. Makowsky thinks, is that "nobody has served up these mega-luxury homes." He added that Los Angeles has performed better than other high-end real estate markets around the country in the past few months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the price tag is an ambitious ask in a city where the record sale price is $100 million. Two homes sold for that amount in 2016. And the market is slowing: The average sales price of a luxury single-family home in the Greater Los Angeles area slipped slightly to $6.72 million in the third quarter of 2016, down from $6.79 million from the same period of the prior year, according to a market report from <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate agent Mauricio Umansky of the Agency, who is not involved in the listing, said that while the Los Angeles market is very strong, "I don't see any house going for $250 million." (In "the next 10 to 15 years, you'll see houses sell for $1 billion," Mr. Makowsky responded.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in a city known for its elaborate spec homes, Mr. Makowsky said his project goes above and beyond. In the neighborhood of Bel-Air, his roughly 38,000-square-foot home comes stocked with roughly $30 million worth of cars and motorcycles, over 125 art installations and a seven-person full-time staff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four-level home has 12 bedrooms and 21 bathrooms, all accessed by elevators lined with crocodile skin. The lower level contains a four-lane bowling alley which comes with bowling shoes in a wide variety of sizes, Mr. Makowsky said. He said the "candy wall," with about 50 different kinds of treats on hand, cost about $200,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Makowsky said he paid more than $11 million (he would not disclose the exact figure) in 2013 to buy the roughly 1.2-acre lot from talk show host Michael Strahan. He said he demolished the existing house and spent about four years building the current house, completing it a few weeks ago. The home is being listed by the husband and wife team of Branden and Rayni Williams at Hilton &amp; Hyland and Ben Bacal of Rodeo Realty.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto  and Ben Leubsdorf </div><div>705 words</div><div>19 January 2017</div><div>09:25</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. housing starts hit their highest level in nine years in 2016, but a slowdown in the pace of new apartment building suggests that it may be difficult for construction to hit new highs this year without a strong rebound in single-family home building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts rose 11.3% in December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.23 million, the Commerce Department said Thursday. Permits, an indication of how much construction is in the pipeline, were down 0.2% to 1.21 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected starts to rise 10.1% in the final month of 2016 to 1.2 million and building permits to rise 2.5% to 1.24 million. Construction typically begins a month or two after a permit is issued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in starts follows a drop in activity in November, when new starts dropped by a revised 16.5%. The drop was largely propelled by a 38.7% drop in the construction of buildings with two or more units, which includes apartments and condos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family housing starts dropped 4% in December while multifamily rebounded 53.9% from a month earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monthly housing figures are choppy, have a significant margin of error and can be subject to large revisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An estimated 1.17 million housing units were started in 2016, nearly 5% more than were started in 2015—making it the strongest year since 2007. But that rise masked a sharp divergence in the types of residential construction under way. Single-family starts were up 9.3% last year, but construction of buildings with five or more units fell 3.1%. A similar pattern was seen in the permits data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home construction has been the weakest element of the overall housing recovery. Home prices have already surpassed their previous highs and apartment rents have climbed more than 26% since early 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strength of multifamily housing construction has helped buoy housing-start numbers, even as single-family activity remains well below normal levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When you look at single-family [construction] we're still at recession levels, which is quite remarkable because historically the real-estate cycle leads the business cycle," said Sam Khater, deputy chief economist at CoreLogic Inc., a housing data firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers look particularly bleak when accounting for population growth. The number of single-family and multifamily starts per 1,000 households remains about 38% below the 50-year average, according to Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist at housing website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The factors holding back builders range from a shortage of laborers, difficulty finding land in desirable locations and regulatory barriers that drive up the cost of a new home beyond what most consumers can afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists are optimistic that single-family housing starts will continue to improve in 2017, as rising wages and a move by younger households toward homeownership help drive up demand. Republicans have pledged to peel back environmental regulations and Donald Trump has promised tax cuts and infrastructure spending that could help extend the economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I am cautiously optimistic that 2017 is going to be an even better year and I hope it is for the sake home buyers," Mr. McLaughlin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. builders remain highly confident about the market for newly built single-family homes, but their optimism slipped in January from the highest level in more than a decade the prior month, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> said Wednesday. The trade group's housing-market index fell to 67 in January from 69 in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, even if single-family housing starts rebound, the overall numbers could be weighed down by a pullback in multifamily starts. Landlords are bracing for a flood of apartment-building completions that is dragging down rents and making leasing up new buildings a slog. As a result, lenders are pulling back on apartment-construction loans.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto   </div><div>440 words</div><div>19 January 2017</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pricey real-estate markets on the coasts are bearing the brunt of the recent rise in mortgage rates and are likely to feel more pain as rates climb, housing economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate for a 30-year mortgage has risen to 4.12% from 3.5% before the election in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An analysis by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> found that home buyers in California's San Francisco County have seen the biggest impact of the rate jump, with a nearly $375 increase in typical monthly mortgage payments for buyers over the past couple of months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's sort of a double whammy," said Danielle Hale, the NAR's managing director of research. At a time when apartment rents are climbing quickly, home prices and mortgage rates also are going up, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other end of the spectrum, Cochran County, Texas, has felt the smallest impact from rising rates, with the typical mortgage payment going up by $13 a month since November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The disparity reflects a deep divide in home prices between the nation's priciest and least expensive markets. The median home value in San Francisco, at more than $1 million, is 28 times that of Cochran County, a rural area near the New Mexico border.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After San Francisco, the markets that have suffered the most from higher rates include San Mateo County in California, Nantucket County in Massachusetts, New York County and Wyoming's Teton County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The markets that are seeing the smallest impact are scattered across states such as Texas, West Virginia, Kentucky and South Dakota.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in expensive coastal markets have seen a rapid run-up, driven by a lack of fresh supply and a flood of new jobs. The median home price in San Francisco County is now 39% above its precrisis peak, according to the <span class="companylink">California Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is evidence buyers are reaching the limit of what they can afford. Jeff Barnett, a Realtor in Silicon Valley, said the market there has slowed, with sales down about 5% in 2016 from the year before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Unless you have unlimited funds, every little tick up in the interest rate lets you buy less and takes people out of the market if they're struggling to buy their first home," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">NAR</span> expects rates to rise to 4.4% by the end of 2017 and 4.8% in 2018.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Connecticut</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home Prices Slip</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Fairfield County</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices have been sliding in Fairfield County as brokers prepare new listings for the spring selling season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a rise in prices early last year, the median price for single-family homes in the county fell to $648,661 in the fourth quarter of 2016, a decline of 2.6% from the same quarter in 2015, according to a market report prepared by appraiser Jonathan Miller for brokerage <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price was down 9.8% from the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales were about flat overall in the fourth quarter with a 26% drop in New Canaan and declines in Fairfield/Southport and Westport, offset by gains in Wilton and Darien.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Greenwich the median sale price was $1.58 million in the fourth quarter, down by less than 1% from the same quarter in 2015, but sales were down by 5.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ingrid Hess, a broker at Sotheby's International Realty, said activity appeared to be picking up among lower-priced properties, while at the upper-end sellers have been slow to reduce prices on properties that weren't selling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said a house with three bedrooms and 2½ baths at 123 Middlesex Road in Darien attracted considerable interest when it went on the market recently at $1.029 million, but so far hasn't found a buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I am overwhelmed at the amount of people who are looking it," she said. "The house is a wonder and it is priced to sell, but last year we had houses that were really unbelievable and nobody was doing anything."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said she was cautiously optimistic about the spring. In another positive sign, the Elliman report found that listing inventory fell more than 30% in the fourth quarter of last year compared with the same quarter in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York City</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners Face</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher Tax Bills</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property-tax bills are going up again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New assessment rolls released this week show the average tax bill for a single-family home will rise $207 to $5,461 across the city, including an increase of $2,168 to $50,556 in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under state law, assessment increases due to rising market values for homeowners can't go up more than 6% a year or 20% over five years. As a result the average rate of increase worked out to about 4% for the year that begins in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tax bills on condominium and rental buildings will rise by an average of 10.5% for condo units, to $10,360, and by 9.5% to an average bill of $4,520 per rental apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increases on rental buildings will hit landlords after two years in which rents on regulated apartments have been frozen by the Rent Guidelines Board, whose members are appointed by the mayor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tax increases on co-operatives and office buildings will be more moderate, with co-op tax bills rising by 6.9% and taxes on top-quality class A office buildings rising by 7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jacques Jiha, the commissioner of the New York City Department of Finance, said overall assessments were up 8.7% to $1.157 trillion for the fiscal year that begins in July, with about 87% of the increase due to rising values and the rest to new construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures assume property-tax rates will remain unchanged next year. But under a formula set out in state law, rates are often adjusted between types of property. As a result the tax rate went up 2% for one- to three-family properties on top of an increase in assessments.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pricey real-estate markets on the coasts are bearing the brunt of the recent rise in mortgage rates and are likely to feel more pain as rates climb, housing economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate for a 30-year mortgage has risen to 4.12% from 3.5% before the election in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An analysis by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> found that home buyers in California's San Francisco County have seen the biggest impact of the rate jump, with a nearly $375 increase in typical monthly mortgage payments for buyers over the last couple of months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's sort of a double whammy," said Danielle Hale, NAR's managing director of research. At a time when apartment rents are climbing quickly, home prices and mortgage rates also are going up, making it tougher to get into the housing market, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other end of the spectrum, Cochran County, Texas, has felt the smallest impact from rising rates, with the typical mortgage payment going up by just $13 a month since November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The disparity reflects a deep divide in home prices between the nation's priciest and least expensive markets. The median home value in San Francisco, at more than $1 million, is 28 times that of Cochran County, a rural area near the New Mexico border.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After San Francisco, the markets that have suffered the most from higher rates include San Mateo County in California, Nantucket County in Massachusetts, New York County and Teton County in Wyoming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The markets that are seeing the smallest impact are scattered across such as Texas, West Virginia, Kentucky and South Dakota.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">News Corp</span>, owner of The Wall Street Journal, also operates Realtor.com under license from the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in expensive coastal markets have seen a rapid run-up in prices, driven by a lack of fresh supply and a flood of new jobs. The median home price in San Francisco County is now 39% above its precrisis peak, according to the <span class="companylink">California Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is evidence that buyers are reaching the limit of what they can afford. Jeff Barnett, a Realtor in Silicon Valley, said the market there has slowed, with about 5% less sales in 2016 than the year before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Unless you have unlimited funds, every little tick up in the interest rate lets you buy less and takes people out of the market if they're struggling to buy their first home," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More pain could be on the horizon. The <span class="companylink">NAR</span> expects rates to rise to 4.4% by the end of 2017 and 4.8% in 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agents are bracing for changes to the tax code that could take an even greater toll on once-hot coastal markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The headwind of higher rates comes as Congress is considering a tax overhaul championed by some Republicans that could include the elimination of the deduction for state and local property taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taxes typically are higher in areas with pricey real estate. And homeowners in those areas are more likely to use the deduction because they have higher incomes and are more likely to itemize on their returns. The changes could mean that buyers gravitate toward less expensive homes.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. builders remain highly confident about the market for newly-built single-family homes, but their optimism slipped in January from the highest level in more than a decade the prior month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>, a trade group, said Wednesday its housing-market index fell to 67 in January. The December reading was revised down to 69 from an initially reading of 70, but it remained the highest monthly reading since 2005. A number over 50 indicates more builders view conditions as good than poor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected a January reading of 69.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Builders begin the year optimistic that a new Congress and administration will help create a better business climate for small businesses, particularly as it relates to streamlining and reforming the regulatory process," said NAHB Chairman Granger MacDonald, a home builder and developer from Kerrville, Texas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the trade group's economist, Robert Dietz, said builders are concerned about rising mortgage interest rates slowing demand for new homes, as well as a lack of lots to build on and labor shortages.</p>

Donald Trump Asks Richard LeFrak, Steven Roth to Monitor Infrastructure Plan's Costs; President-elect to name New York-based developers to oversee council of 15 to 20 builders and engineers</span>
</div><div class="author">By Peter Grant and Ted Mann </div><div>889 words</div><div>16 January 2017</div><div>16:35</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that members of the Senate Commerce Committee elicited a pledge from Transportation Secretary-designate Elaine Chao this week. The pledge was received last week. (Jan. 16.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President-elect Donald Trump is planning to name real-estate developers Richard LeFrak and Steven Roth to head up a new council he is creating to monitor spending on his proposed $1 trillion plan to improve the nation's roads, bridges and other public works.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trump said in an interview Friday with Wall Street Journal reporters and editors that he has asked the two New York-based developers, whom he has known for decades, to oversee the council of 15 to 20 builders and engineers. "They're pros," he said. "That's what they do. All their lives, they build. They build under-budget, ahead of schedule."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trump said he had just met with Messrs. Roth and LeFrak. "They've already agreed to do it," Mr. Trump said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. LeFrak, one of the country's wealthiest developers, is known for sprawling master-planned projects such as Newport, a 400-acre project on the New Jersey waterfront opposite Manhattan. His current projects include a $4 billion mixed-use development in North Miami that he's building with the Soffer family of Florida, who have investments in such properties as the Fontainebleau Miami Beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Mr. Trump, Mr. LeFrak also comes from one of New York's real estate dynasties. The two are both in their early 70s and have known each other from the early days of their careers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the years, Mr. Trump clashed with Mr. LeFrak's late father, Samuel LeFrak. But he and Richard LeFrak became close friends and often go out socially. Mr. LeFrak attended the Republican convention and watched the election returns from a special suite at the New York Hilton set up for Mr. Trump's top supporters and funders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Richard is truly outstanding," Mr. Trump wrote in his 1997 book, "The Art of the Comeback." "When I watch Richard in action, it's hard to believe that Sam could have produced such a guy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Roth is chairman and chief executive of Vornado Realty Trust, a large real-estate investment trust that owns high profile office and retail property in New York, Washington, D.C. and other cities. Vornado controls two of Mr. Trump's most valuable assets: 30% stakes in office buildings at 1290 Sixth Avenue in Manhattan and 555 California Street in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trump's annual pretax income from the two assets comes to roughly $22.7 million, according to a financial services firm's analysis last year of Vornado filings with the <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spokesmen for Messrs. LeFrak and Roth declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trump pledged during the campaign to embark on a roughly $1 trillion infrastructure program[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/donald-trumps-infrastructure-plan-faces-speed-bumps-1478884989], saying the nation needs to rebuild crumbling roads and bridges, expand telecommunications networks, and repair aging water systems. The Trump campaign said investing in infrastructure would help stimulate employment and economic growth in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike previous stimulus efforts, however, Mr. Trump's infrastructure program would rely primarily on private investors, using new tax breaks to lure private capital for major construction projects. Trump allies Peter Navarro, who will be involved in trade issues in the new White House, and Wilbur Ross, who has been slated to become Mr. Trump's Commerce Secretary, said financing $1 trillion in projects would require an equity investment of $167 billion, and proposed an 82% tax credit for investors who participate in the program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The private sector approach has been viewed skeptically by Democrats. Members of the Senate Commerce Committee, who elicited a pledge from Transportation Secretary-designate Elaine Chao last week that the Trump infrastructure plan would also include direct federal spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Democrats argue direct spending is necessary to create jobs and ensure that the program doesn't fund only projects attractive to investors. Former advisers to President Barack Obama also noted that without any plan to pay for the tax credits, they would add to the deficit, while having a less effective stimulus effect on the economy than direct appropriation by the government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trump also will have to square his campaign pledge to ensure that infrastructure construction uses American steel and supplies with resistance to such requirements among some conservatives and Republicans in the Congress. Critics say "Buy American" provisions in procurement contracts can drive up costs, but Mr. Trump has insisted that his proposed spending plans will generate demand domestically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his interview with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Trump said the council that Messrs. Roth and LeFrak will head will include the country's top builders and engineers. "Some of the projects they'll throw out. Some of the projects they'll expand. But all of the projects, they'll make sure we get a tremendous bang for the buck," Mr. Trump said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trump was critical of past infrastructure efforts for enriching contractors but not building anything. He said that Messrs. Roth and LeFrak "have a great nose, not only for pricing, but also for what you need and what you don't need."</p>

Wanda Group, Owned by China's Richest Man, Suffers Rare Revenue Drop; Wang Jianlin's property-to-entertainment conglomerate hit by its first annual revenue decline in at least six years</span>
</div><div class="author">By Dominique Fong and Wayne Ma </div><div>705 words</div><div>16 January 2017</div><div>05:30</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Facing trouble in China's property market, China's richest man is shifting his focus to entertainment[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/chinas-richest-man-makes-his-move-on-hollywood-1475256816].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Dalian Wanda Group</span>, closely held by billionaire Wang Jianlin, saw its 2016 revenue drop almost 14% from a year earlier because of a decline in residential property sales, the company said Saturday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the first annual decline in revenue since at least 2010, according to a review of company statements by The Wall Street Journal. In addition, 2016 was the first time that more than half of Wanda's revenue came from services, including its entertainment business, instead of real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Property sales in some lower-tier cities are quite challenging, and <span class="companylink">Dalian Wanda</span> has a pretty high exposure to lower-tier cities," Kaven Tsang, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wanda's revenue drop is the latest sign of distress in China's flagging property market, in the wake of sweeping property controls that are expected to slow the pace of home sales amid a glut of inventory in lower-tier cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Moody's</span> this month said it was reviewing the Baa 2 credit rating of <span class="companylink">Dalian Wanda Commercial Properties Co</span>., the property-development arm of the company, for a possible downgrade. The credit-rating firm estimates the unit's debt load to increase—with at least 80 billion yuan of new debt over the next two years—as the company looks to build more malls, but generates lower property sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wanda still gets about 75% of its revenue from real estate, but in recent years Mr. Wang has aggressively reduced Wanda's dependence on property, initially by opening movie theaters and later building tourism-destination centers across China. The company's cultural arm has been opening movie theaters and tourism-destination centers across China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wanda's revenues from entertainment have tripled since 2012 and comprised more than a quarter of its total revenue last year, or 64.1 billion yuan, the company said. That was up from an 18% contribution in 2015, according to calculations by The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unit includes sports, film, tourism and children's entertainment branches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wanda has gone on an entertainment shopping spree in the U.S., picking up theater chain <span class="companylink">AMC Entertainment</span> in 2012 and last year acquiring film producer Legendary Entertainment[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/chinas-dalian-wanda-buys-legendary-entertainment-for-3-5-billion-1452567251] and awards-show producer Dick Clark Productions[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/chinas-wanda-group-to-buy-dick-clark-productions-for-about-1-billion-1478223352], which stages the Golden Globes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wanda said it wanted to exit real-estate development not because of its dim view of the housing market, but because the sector was too cyclical. China has had five housing booms in the past decade. Wanda also cited a desire to shift toward managing rather than owning properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company said that in five or six years it would "see profit from real-estate sales account for only a tiny share" of revenue at <span class="companylink">Dalian Wanda Commercial Properties Co</span>. That unit is expected to rely more on property-management fees in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wanda's plan to exit from the property market is to sell its Wanda Plaza shopping malls to other investors, adopting an "asset-light" model that would allow it to earn income from managing the malls instead of owning them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts have said this would lighten the debt load of the property unit. However, it will be a challenge to unload those properties due to the excess supply of malls in lower-tier cities[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/china-suffers-from-glut-of-shopping-malls-1483458666]—and as more Chinese customers shop online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The issue here is that it might not be very easy to dispose of all those properties," said Matthew Kong, an analyst at S&amp;P Global Ratings. "They need to find investors for those shopping malls."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The holiday-shortened workweek will see inflation releases in the U.S. and U.K., the first <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> meeting of 2017, a batch of data from China, as well as the official beginning of the Donald Trump presidency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MONDAY: Markets in the U.S. will be closed in observance of Martin Luther King's Birthday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TUESDAY: British consumers powered the economy through June's Brexit vote and beyond, but many economists think accelerating inflation will weigh on household spending this year. Consumer-price data, as well as measures of producer-price inflation and house prices, will shed light on how the slide in the pound since Brexit is feeding into the prices faced by businesses and consumers. The consumer price index rose 1.2%[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-k-consumer-price-growth-hits-two-year-high-1481624133] year-over-year in November, and economists expect it to have picked up to 1.4% in December, with more gains seen in the coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WEDNESDAY: The <span class="companylink">U.S. Labor Department</span> will release its headline inflation gauge, the consumer price index. In November, the index rose 1.7%[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-consumer-prices-posted-fourth-straight-rise-in-november-1481808691] from a year earlier, and the core index, which excludes food and energy, was running stronger at 2.1%. Later Wednesday, the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> will release its industrial production index. Industrial production dipped in November[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-industrial-production-fell-in-november-1481725116], and economists are expecting a strong bounceback with a monthly increase of 0.6% more than offsetting November's 0.4% decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THURSDAY: European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi will face the media after the <span class="companylink">ECB</span>'s first policy meeting of the year. The eurozone monetary authority is expected to stand pat, six weeks after it announced an extension of its quantitative-easing program[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/ecb-to-extends-stimulus-program-by-nine-months-at-reduced-rate-1481201978]. But Mr. Draghi likely will be quizzed on the bank's next moves, including when it might start to wind down, or taper, QE.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FRIDAY: China will release its fourth-quarter gross domestic product figure along with December's industrial production, fixed asset investment, retail and property data (to be released Thursday night U.S. time).

</div><div class="author">By Stefanos Chen   </div><div>409 words</div><div>13 January 2017</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More home buyers are getting cold feet and bowing out of deals before the closing, according to an analysis by real-estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The percentage of homes that had an offer but failed to close rose to 3.9% in 2016, compared with 2015, when 2.1% of sales fizzled, according to <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>. The company defined a failed sale as any listing with a preliminary buyer agreement that reverted back to for-sale status.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company examined aborted sales of luxury homes, those in the top third of a given region's home values. (<span class="companylink">Trulia</span> uses comparable listings and sales to determine home value.) Potential buyers of luxury homes in Akron, Ohio, walked away from deals more often than anywhere else in the nation, with 9.4% of pending-sale contracts falling apart in 2016, up from 1.3% a year prior. Akron was followed by Ventura County, Calif. (8.9%), Tucson, Ariz. (8.2%), and Kansas City, Mo. (7.9%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the biggest reasons luxury home sales fell apart was seller confidence, said Jim Fox with Stouffer Realty in Akron.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The high-end buyer doesn't have to buy, and if they do, they want the sun, the moon and the stars," he said. Sellers are less likely to make concessions in a tight market, such as paying for repairs, because they're confident other offers will come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes that need a lot of repairs or renovations are also scaring potential luxury buyers away, said Felipe Chacon, a <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> housing-data analyst. In Akron, where the median list price of a luxury home is $276,333, roughly half of the high-end homes on the market were built between 1940 and 1970 -- a likely age when renovations are needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luxury buyers aren't immune from credit concerns. "Even for million-dollar homes, financing is important," said Lyle Elliott with <span class="companylink">Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices</span> in Ventura, Calif. While many luxury buyers can afford to pay cash, some say low interest rates make financing more appealing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a costly surprise during a home inspection might sour their investment strategy, he said. "They're much more concerned with, 'Am I getting the right product for the right dollar,'" he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allysia Finley writes: "What constricts the housing supply are stringent zoning and environmental regulations, which Democratic politicians in Sacramento have refused to relax. All this results in housing prices that could be fairly described as astronomical" ("Uncomfortable Truths Behind California's Economic Surge[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/uncomfortable-truths-behind-californias-economic-surge-1483747393]," Cross Country, Jan. 7). For those living in a city, stringent zoning and environmental regulations support livability. A fire attributed to inadequate code enforcement in a music concert warehouse venue recently killed 36 young people in Oakland. Ms. Finley also writes, "Over the past four years, the median home price in Oakland has doubled to $620,000." You can bet that's not caused by overly restrictive building codes or even surging demand from population growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"> Look instead to surplus liquidity bombarding realty markets as an arena for speculation. In a replay from the last decade, banks have been expanding loans to house flippers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices and rentals are beyond 2007 peak bubble levels. Since at least 2013, investment companies have been aggressively buying homes, converting them to rentals and selling bonds backed by rental incomes. Academics attribute the rising prices to interrelated forces of financialization, neoliberalism and globalization.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOME SALES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regionwide Gains Reflect U.S. Trend</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Manhattan housing market may be slumping, but sales have been soaring in other parts of the region, from Brooklyn to Westchester County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Brooklyn, sales jumped 22% in the fourth quarter, compared with same quarter in 2015, according to a report for brokerage <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> prepared by appraiser Jonathan Miller. That was the swiftest sales pace for a fourth quarter since Mr. Miller began tracking sales volume in 2008. The median price was up 15% in the period to $750,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Westchester recorded the most fourth-quarter sales since at least 1981, while inventory fell to its lowest level in a fourth quarter in 15 years. The median price, including cooperatives and condominiums, was up 3.1% to $438,000, though the median price on single-family homes remained unchanged at $565,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Queens also recorded gains, with the median price rising 6% to $498,000 in the quarter, compared with the fourth quarter a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller said the improvement reflects a national trend as the economy gathers momentum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There has been a consistent pattern of heavy sales volume in city and suburban markets in New York," he said, "at the same time we are seeing inventory remaining chronically low."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales in Manhattan are out of sync with this trend, he said. They rebounded strongly earlier, in 2013 and 2014, while the rest of the local market remained weak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RENTALS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two Boroughs Had a Weak December</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rental market in Manhattan and Brooklyn showed signs of weakness in December, with concessions offered by landlords increasing and rents remaining flat or falling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The share of new rentals with concessions, typically owner-paid brokerage fees or one or more months of free rent, rose to 35% in Manhattan in December. That was the highest level recorded since April 2010, according to brokerage Citi Habitats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is still a disconnect between the rents that landlords want to achieve and the pricing tenants are willing to pay, which is why concessions remain a significant force in the marketplace," said Gary Malin, president of Citi Habitats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Malin said the concessions helped maintain demand in December, typically one of the slowest months of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median rent in Manhattan in December was $3,388 a month, up 1.1% from December 2015, according to a report for brokerage <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> prepared by appraiser Jonathan Miller. But after taking into account concessions, the net effective rent was down 0.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Brooklyn, the median monthly rent of $2,700 was down 3.8%, or a 4.4% decline after including the effect of concessions.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Stefanos Chen </div><div>500 words</div><div>11 January 2017</div><div>10:18</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More home buyers are getting cold feet and bowing out of deals before the closing, according to an analysis [http://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/sale-fail]by real-estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The percentage of homes that had an offer but failed to close rose to 3.9% in 2016, compared with 2015, when 2.1% of sales fizzled, according to <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>. The company defined a failed sale as any listing with a preliminary buyer agreement that reverted back to for-sale status.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The highest share of failed sales overall was in the starter-home market, where 6.3% of buyers backed out of deals in 2016, up from 3.4% the year prior. That's in part because starter homes, those valued in the bottom third of the region's market, saw an influx of first-time home buyers last year[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/affordable-starter-homes-prove-increasingly-elusive-1462527001], said Felipe Chacon, a <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> housing-data analyst. These buyers were more likely to hit financing hurdles or underestimate closing costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company also examined aborted sales of luxury homes, those in the top third of a given region's home values. (<span class="companylink">Trulia</span> uses comparable listings and sales to determine home values.) Potential buyers of luxury homes in Akron, Ohio, walked away from deals more often than anywhere else in the nation, with 9.4% of pending-sale contracts falling apart in 2016, up from 1.3% a year prior. Akron was followed by Ventura County, Calif. (8.9%), Tucson, Ariz. (8.2%), and Kansas City, Mo. (7.9%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the biggest reasons luxury home sales fell apart was seller confidence, said Jim Fox with Stouffer Realty in Akron.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The high-end buyer doesn't have to buy, and if they do, they want the sun, the moon and the stars," he said. Sellers are less likely to make concessions in a tight market, such as paying for repairs, because they're confident other offers will come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes that need a lot of repairs or renovations are also scaring potential luxury buyers away, said Mr. Chacon. In Akron, where the median list price of a luxury home is $276,333, roughly half of the high-end homes on the market were built between 1940 and 1970—a likely age when renovations are needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luxury buyers aren't immune from credit concerns. "Even for million-dollar homes, financing is important," said Lyle Elliott with <span class="companylink">Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices</span> in Ventura, Calif. While many luxury buyers can afford to pay cash, some say low interest rates make financing more appealing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a costly surprise during a home inspection might sour their investment strategy, he said. "They're much more concerned with, ‘Am I getting the right product for the right dollar,' " he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After more than a year of euphoria in China's housing market, 2017 looks to be a perilous letdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property prices in the Middle Kingdom surged 18% in the first 11 months of 2016, continuing the previous year's rebound. The rally was kicked off by the biggest, so-called Tier 1, cities in 2015 but has since spread to smaller ones. Property prices in the southern metropolis of Shenzhen, for example, have doubled from two years ago, after rising by another 29% in 2016. Shanghai prices increased by 24%. Smaller Tier 3 cities' prices have gone up 9% -- making 2016 the first year of gains in three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that was last year's party. Prices are suddenly growing with a bit less gusto and may be peaking. In recent months, local governments have started using homebuying restrictions to rein in runaway prices. At an annual top-level economic meeting in December, central-government policy makers made curbing the property bubble one of the top priorities for 2017. In a market where the state plays a big part, policy change is a good predictor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will be a tricky transition since property is so integral to almost everything in China's economy. A price meltdown will hurt local governments as land sales are a major source of government revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state-owned banking system, meanwhile, is heavily exposed, both directly to home buyers and property projects, and through the use of property as collateral in business loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And state-owned enterprises were aggressive buyers of land in 2016 in a market where prices of land sometimes traded higher than those of fully built apartments nearby on a per-square-meter basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such a balancing act could be harder and riskier to pull off as debt builds up along with every cycle. Property-related loans grew 25% in the first three quarters in 2016, adding 4.32 trillion yuan ($622.51 billion) of debt to the banking system. Mortgages grew at an even faster pace of 33%. While the loan-to-value ratio for the overall market may looks comfortable at 55%, new home buyers are much more leveraged. <span class="companylink">UBS</span> estimated the loan-to-value ratio for new-home purchases at close to 70%, high by Chinese standards, where cash buyers used to be common. A drop in housing prices could push the ratio to dangerous levels, especially in fast-rising cities like Shenzhen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the biggest property developers have also loaded up on debt. China Evergrande, the country's biggest developer by assets, has seen its net debt, including perpetual securities, double since the end of 2014. Borrowings at other developers like Country Garden and <span class="companylink">Sunac China</span> have also ballooned during the boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the accumulated risks and the effects on the broader economy, China's property market may just be the most important in the world for investors to watch. In 2017, euphoria will again turn to worry.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Los Angeles -- Happy days are here again in the Golden State -- or so it might seem. Housing prices are nearing their prerecession peak. Gas prices have dropped by $2 a gallon since their apex five years ago. Employers are hiring: a net gain of 377,000 jobs in the past year alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2012, California's economy has grown faster (an annual compounded 3.4%) than every state save Texas (4.8%) and Colorado (3.6%), according to the <span class="companylink">Bureau of Economic Analysis</span>. Tech has led the upswing, but agriculture and manufacturing have increased, too. Lo, California two years ago eclipsed France to become the world's sixth-largest economy, with a GDP of $2.46 trillion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state continues to defy conservatives' predictions that its progressive tax and regulatory policies -- from carbon "cap and trade" to limits on suburban sprawl -- will strangle the economy. Democratic politicians tout California's apparent resurgence as vindication for liberal governance. Yet the Gilded State is prospering despite the government-imposed handicaps, and for much of the middle class the economic luster is illusive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seat of wealth-creation is Silicon Valley, where tech King Midases enrich nearly everything they touch, from real estate to retail. Unemployment in the San Francisco Bay Area is effectively nonexistent, with the official jobless rate hovering around 3%. Oakland, once shady, has become the Brooklyn of the West -- a fast-gentrifying hipster mecca -- and Los Angeles's glitzy "Silicon Beach" has overtaken grungy Venice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the exorbitant cost of living, driven principally by high prices for energy and housing, is pushing working-class families inland and out of state. Last year 109,000 more people left California than moved there, according to the Census Bureau. By contrast, Florida gained 207,000 and Texas added 126,000 net migrants. State data show that California refugees are mostly fleeing coastal counties for neighboring states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What constricts the housing supply are stringent zoning and environmental regulations, which Democratic politicians in Sacramento have refused to relax. All this results in housing prices that could be fairly described as astronomical.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past four years, the median home price in Oakland has doubled to $620,000. House-flipping by investors, common before the recession, is back en vogue -- further driving up costs. Yet renting is no solution. Not a single county in the state has recorded a median rent below $1,100 a month, according to the state Department of Housing and Community Development. In San Francisco the average monthly rent exceeds $4,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That beats even New York City. The four most expensive metropolitan rental markets in the nation, according to a November analysis by Zillow, are San Jose, San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego. A third of California renters spend more than half their income on housing. Although California represents 12% of the nation's population, it hosts 22% of its homeless.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sky-scraping rents and home prices give new impetus to liberal demands for subsidized housing and a "living wage." But subsidizing housing for low-income residents would simply drive up prices for middle earners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The minimum wage, set to rise to $15 an hour, is no fix either. The state housing department estimates that a person working full time at that rate still couldn't afford rent higher than $780 a month. And the higher minimum wage will hurt struggling employers in inland areas like the Central Valley (where unemployment is around 9%). Silicon Valley businesses support these progressive policies anyway because they fear that a working-class exodus -- baristas, plumbers, landscapers, housekeepers, food deliverers -- from the Bay Area would imperil the region's economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As blue-collar workers flee, they are being replaced by immigrants and their children. Today more than 1 in 4 Californians was born in another country -- compared with 13.5% of Arizonans and 16.6% of Texans. It isn't so much that immigrants are willing to do jobs that native-born Americans won't, but that they don't mind commuting long distances or living in cramped quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California has also benefited -- despite itself -- from shale fracking, which has helped drive down average gas prices to $2.78 a gallon from a peak of $4.66 in 2012. Cheap fossil fuels have eased the economic costs of Sacramento's environmental policies, such as the state's cap-and-trade program and its renewables mandate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, gasoline and electric prices in California are the highest in the continental West, burdening energy-intensive industries. Although the state's manufacturing base has expanded in the past few years, that growth has been driven almost entirely by high tech -- computers, electronics, chemical products. These businesses use less labor and energy than traditional manufacturing, but they create high-value products that boost the state's GDP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One Silicon Valley leader recently complained to the Journal about the high costs of doing business there. But the state's abundance of human capital, he said, nonetheless made it worthwhile. To adapt Adam Smith, there is a great deal of ruin in a state as innovative and resourceful as California.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Billy Bush Sells New York Home</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Billy Bush, the television personality who left the "Today" show after a tape surfaced showing him engaging in crude talk with then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, has sold his New York City townhouse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bush had listed the Chelsea townhouse for $8.995 million in April 2016 with Howard Morrel and Rebecca Kilborne of Engel &amp; Volkers New York Real Estate. In October, after Mr. Bush parted ways with "Today," the house saw several price cuts and was most recently asking $8.25 million. Mr. Morrel said the deal for the house closed in the past few days but declined to specify the sale price or the buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to public documents, Mr. Bush bought the house for $8.8 million about a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four-floor townhouse is 20 feet wide and measures about 4,300 square feet, Mr. Morrel said. The house has been stripped and is ready for renovation, he said, adding that Mr. Bush had planned to renovate the townhouse but decided to sell it instead. A rendering of a proposed renovation is featured above.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Morrel said he wasn't privy to Mr. Bush's reasons for selling. But he noted that the market for Manhattan townhouses has softened over the past year. "It's more challenging to sell a townhouse today than it was 12 months ago," Mr. Morrel said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyer was represented by Francis Russo of <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</span>, who declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tape of Messrs. Bush and Trump was recorded in 2005, when Mr. Bush was co-host of NBC's entertainment show "Access Hollywood." Since it became public in early October, Mr. Bush has been heavily criticized for his role in the conversation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bush, who joined "Today" last summer, was suspended from the show after the tape became public and left the show a short time later. He didn't respond to a request for comment about the sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hawaiian Spec House Goes on</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">the Market for $14.75 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spec house in the Kukio gated community on Hawaii's Big Island is listing for $14.75 million, according to listing agent Harold Clarke.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The newly completed property is one of the most expensive homes for sale on the Big Island, said Mr. Clarke, although he said vacant lots on the ocean in the area have recently sold for more than $20 million. Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz bought a $25 million home nearby in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The single-story house has five bedrooms and measures about 5,800 square feet. Each of the home's bedrooms have private outdoor showers, Mr. Clarke said. The outdoor swimming pool is 56 feet long with an eight-person Jacuzzi. The property has "a lot of covered outdoor space," and tiki torches and a gas firepit turn on at the touch of a button, Mr. Clarke said. This 2.23-acre property doesn't have ocean frontage but does have views of the Pacific and Maui, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seller is Hong Kong-based architect Branko Pahor, who said he spent about $11 million buying the land, building and furnishing the house, down to cooking utensils and extra pillows. Mr. Pahor said he has been visiting the Big Island for over 20 years, and chose Kukio because the community "is extremely boutique and only attracts high net worth clientele."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kukio residents have access to the Kukio Golf and Beach Club, a private club with two golf courses, restaurants, a fitness center and a club house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Southampton Home Trimmed to $65 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A French Chateau-style home in the <span class="companylink">Hamptons</span> is getting a price cut to $65 million from $75 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property, which sits on about 3 1/2 acres on the ocean in Southampton Village, first went on the market in the summer, when it was being offered along with an adjacent five-bedroom house owned by the same family for a total of $100 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time both homes were also available individually: the oceanfront home for $75 million and the other house for $35 million. This time the oceanfront property is being offered by itself for $65 million, and the other home isn't on the market, according to Cody Vichinsky of Bespoke Real Estate, who has the listing with Howard Morrel and Leslie Hirsch of Engel &amp; Volkers New York Real Estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The owner, the late John F. Sullivan, built both houses as a family compound around 1990, said Mr. Sullivan's daughter, Lisa Crawford. The oceanfront house has four bedrooms and measures roughly 9,200 square feet, with fireplace mantels and other materials imported from Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Vichinsky said zoning in the area allows the house to be expanded to roughly 18,000 square feet, which he said would make it one of the largest homes on the ocean in the <span class="companylink">Hamptons</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Crawford said she has decided to keep the adjacent house, which she and her family use as a weekend home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to his daughter, Mr. Sullivan, who died in May, was a founding partner at Faulkner, Dawkins &amp; Sullivan, a small boutique brokerage firm that was acquired by Shearson Hayden Stone and then <span class="companylink">American Express</span>. In 1978, he co-founded the advisory firm Sullivan, Morrissey &amp; Mickle Capital Management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Morrel said he and Ms. Hirsch also have the listing for Mr. Sullivan's townhouse on 62nd Street in Manhattan, which is on the market for $14.5 million.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The days of record-low mortgage rates are over, experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the election on Nov. 8, the average rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate jumbo mortgage increased to its highest level since April 2014, to 4.41% for the week ending Dec. 23, according to the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>, an industry trade group. That number dropped slightly to 4.37% for the week ending Dec. 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is being driven by investor expectations that the U.S. economy is both likely to grow faster and have somewhat higher inflation over the next couple of years," says Michael Fratantoni, chief economist of the MBA. "That translates to higher rates."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month the Federal Open Market Committee voted to raise the target range for the federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point in response to a stronger labor market and to curb inflation. And the Fed signaled that additional increases of its benchmark rate are on the horizon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite these headwinds, the prognosis for the housing market remains good. According to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>, existing-home sales are projected to reach 5.42 million in 2016, 3.3% higher than 2015 and the best year since 2006. (Final 2016 numbers are scheduled for release on Jan. 24.) In 2017, sales are forecast to grow an additional 2%, to 5.52 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Some people who have been on the fence and are worried about rising rates might have one more reason to make a bid on a house," says Brian Koss, executive vice president of Mortgage Network, a mortgage company based in Danvers, Mass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Koss says that rising interest rates won't price most buyers out of the market, but, because mortgage rates directly affect affordability, it might "take you to a different neighborhood or a house that needs more work or from a four-bedroom to a three-bedroom."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, expects rates for conforming loans to hit 4.5% by the end of 2017 and says that jumbo loans should be roughly in line with the conforming rates. "Historically, that's a very favorable rate, but compared to recent times, it is pinching the consumer," he says. "The period of ultra-low interest rates is over. We are getting back toward normalization, so this rate increase should not be viewed as alarming." (<span class="companylink">News Corp</span>, which owns The Wall Street Journal, also owns Realtor.com, the listing website of the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yun says that while home buyers might face higher monthly mortgage payments, at the current median home price, a typical buyer is looking at about a $70 difference per month. Those with jumbo loans would likely pay more because they're borrowing more, Mr. Yun added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People are worried about affordability, and in areas where there has been a strong run-up in prices, such as California and some Florida markets, the price increase is hurting affordability," he says. "If you add on top of that the higher mortgage rate, people really begin to feel the pinch."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Dec. 7, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, a real-estate website, released a housing outlook report for 2017, based on a survey of 4,088 adults conducted online in October and November. The report found that despite rising interest rates, only 18% of renters who wish to buy a home were concerned about rates stifling their ability to purchase. Instead, 59% of those surveyed cited saving for a down payment as a bigger challenge, while 38% cited poor credit and 35% feared rising home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are some other considerations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Equity aid. Depending on where they live, borrowers might have built a considerable amount of equity in their homes from rising prices; those in high-cost areas can tap this equity to use as a down payment on their next home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Time to refinance? Consider fast-tracking a refinancing, says Mr. Fratantoni. "Someone who has a 4% mortgage may not see a lot of opportunities to refinance over the next year, but someone who is still in a 5% mortgage might have another opportunity at some point if rates dip," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Relax. Remember that mortgage rates are increasing, but not too much. Despite the probability that the Fed will raise rates again in 2017, most economists forecast rates to be about 4.5% by the end of 2017.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jason Douglas </div><div>517 words</div><div>5 January 2017</div><div>11:13</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON—Activity in Britain' services sector grew in December at the fastest pace in more than a year, buoyed by healthy demand at home and a boost to exports from a weak pound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data add to signs that the U.K. economy ended 2016 on a strong footing, further defying expectations of a post-Brexit slowdown. But many economists warn growth is set to ease off in 2017 as accelerating inflation squeezes consumers' wallets and uncertainty over the U.K.'s future ties to the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> weighs on business investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, global economic prospects look uncertain, following Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential vote in November and looming elections in France and Germany.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Andrew Haldane, the Bank of England's chief economist, said Thursday there appeared to be a disconnect between policy makers' caution on growth and the more upbeat view displayed by investors, who have in recent weeks driven global stock markets higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At some point these two parallel universes need to come together," Mr. Haldane said—adding that it wasn't clear how the global economy would take this reckoning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial information firm <span class="companylink">IHS Markit Ltd</span>. said its purchasing managers index for the services sector rose to 56.2 in December from 55.2 a month earlier, marking the fastest pace of growth since July 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The expansion in services, which account for almost 80% of the U.K.'s annual output, was driven by new product launches, marketing efforts and bumper exports, which have benefited from a slide in sterling since Britain voted to leave the <span class="companylink">EU</span> in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similar gauges of activity for manufacturing and construction also recorded gains in December, suggesting the British economy is set for another quarter of healthy growth in the final three months of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy's strength has confounded widespread predictions of a sharp slowdown in the aftermath of June's referendum[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/brexit-vote-stunned-britons-awake-to-a-new-era-for-u-k-1466768937]. Prime Minister Theresa May has said she would give Brussels formal notice of the U.K.'s intention to withdraw by the end of March[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-k-s-may-plans-to-trigger-article-50-by-end-of-march-1475401597] and is due early this year to sketch out more detail on her objectives in coming Brexit negotiations, scheduled to last at least two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say the economy's recent strength may not last, however, as sterling's decline is fueling a revival in inflation that is expected to hurt consumer spending. Thursday's survey found cost pressures for firms rose in December at a rate close to November's five-year high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span>, which cut its benchmark interest rate[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/bank-of-england-cuts-key-interest-rate-to-new-low-1470309155] in August to cushion the economy from any Brexit-related jitters, has said it expects annual inflation to overshoot its 2% goal in the first half of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Haldane said Thursday he expected consumers to "throttle back" spending in the coming months as quickening price increases started to bite.</p>

Metric has asked its investors to have their commitments ready by the end of January and plans to hold a first close in late January or early February. Most of the investors in Fund II are expected to re-invest with the firm. The fund will charge a standard 2% management fee and 20% carried interest. Metric typically backs European small and midsize companies and can provide senior secured debt, subordinated debt and equity financing.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kirsten Grind and Peter Rudegeair   </div><div>1368 words</div><div>30 December 2016</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Europe Edition)</div><div>WSJE</div><div>B5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House flipping, a potent symbol of the real-estate market's excess in the run-up to the financial crisis, is once again becoming hot, fueled by a combination of skyrocketing home prices, venture-backed startups and Wall Street cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After nearly being felled by real-estate forays almost a decade ago, a number of banks are now arranging financing vehicles for house flippers, who aim to make a profit by buying and selling homes in a matter of months. The sector is small -- participants say roughly several hundred million dollars in financing deals have been made in recent months -- but is expected to keep growing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent months, big banks, including <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo &amp; Co</span>., <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co</span>. have started extending credit lines to companies that specialize in lending to home flippers. Earlier this month, <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> agreed to lend an estimated $60 million to 5 Arch Funding, an Irvine, Calif., company that offers financing to flippers, according to people familiar with the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The floodgates have opened," says Eduardo Axtle, a 35-year-old former telecom entrepreneur in Oakland, Calif., who has taken out about 50 home loans over the past five years. These days, he is bombarded by unsolicited emails from brokers offering him access to financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of investors who flipped a house in the first nine months of 2016 reached the highest level since 2007. About one-third of the deals in the third quarter were financed with debt, a percentage not seen in eight years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trying to win business, big banks in the past few weeks have flown executives to Southern California -- where much of the house-flipping activity is occurring -- to organize funding deals, say people familiar with the meetings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors are making an average profit of about $61,000 on each flip, up from about $19,000 at the bottom of the market in 2009, according to housing-research firm ATTOM Data Solutions, which is the parent company of real-estate website RealtyTrac. The calculation measures the difference between the housing value when an investor purchases the home and when it is sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market for house-flipping loans in the U.S. is expected to reach about $48 billion in total sales volume this year, the highest since 2006, according to ATTOM.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is in part because home prices across the country are rising, reaching levels not seen since before the 2008 financial crisis. Housing also is in relatively short supply. Meanwhile, low interest rates and a surge in demand for homes from institutional buyers have also benefited house flippers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some borrowers and private lenders say investors have been offered debt in excess of the value of the home, also known as a high loan-to-value ratio. Others say some lenders are loosening up their documentation rules, requiring bank statements to get a loan, but not a W-2 tax earnings statement, for instance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As these loans are made by relatively small finance companies and aren't classified as owner-occupied loans, they don't fall under many of the postcrisis rules written for banks and home mortgages. Some banks used to make these loans directly but now fund finance companies instead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The boom is being accelerated by online lenders such as San Francisco-based LendingHome Corp. and <span class="companylink">Asset Avenue Inc</span>. in Los Angeles, as well as crowdfunding websites such as Groundfloor Finance Inc. that allow individual investors to fund fix-and-flip loans. LendingHome, backed by venture-capital investors, says it has extended more than $1 billion in loans in the 2 1/2 years since its launch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anchor Loans is one of the largest private lenders to house flippers. The Calabasas, Calif., company has received more than $220 million in new credit facilities, mostly from major banks, in 2016 alone, said Chief Executive Stephen Pollack, who declined to identify the banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the financial crisis, a shortage of funding from large banks meant that Anchor had to turn away fix-and-flip business. This year, the company is on track to originate $1.1 billion in loans to real-estate investors, up from $713 million in 2015, Mr. Pollack says. "For the first time in our history, we actually have enough money to lend," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Loans to house flippers are short term -- usually around seven months -- and come with interest rates ranging between 7% and 12%. Because real-estate investors are typically higher risk, they put more cash down -- sometimes as much as 65%. By comparison, a 30-year home mortgage has an interest rate around 4%, and borrowers typically don't put more than 25% down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past year, 37-year-old David Franco has collected profits of more than $200,000 on houses that he has quickly refurbished and resold, turning a hobby into an unexpectedly lucrative business. "There's plenty of money to be made," says Mr. Franco, who lives just outside of Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increasing amount of speculative housing in recent months is "concerning," ATTOM noted in a recent report. "We're starting to see home flipping hit some milestones not seen since prior to the financial crisis."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ATTOM said profit margins are getting squeezed in some markets. While house flippers typically aim to purchase a house at a 30% discount to the market, in some areas they are buying homes at a 15% or 10% discount, said Senior Vice President Daren Blomquist. The research firm noted that the number of smaller, inexperienced house flippers entering the market is a sign of rising speculation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George Geronsin, 36, a Southern California real-estate agent and house flipper who has been in the business since 2008, said he recently sold the majority of the homes he was working on and is sitting on cash "until the next big correction" in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Anybody and everybody is getting into the business ofhouse flipping -- that's when you know it's the end of the rope," said Mr. Geronsin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors in one large crowdfunding site, <span class="companylink">Realty Mogul Co</span>., were interested in funding $1 billion in fix-and-flip loans through its marketplace, said CEO Jilliene Helman. But the company decided to stop making such loans this summer because competition among lenders meant it couldn't charge a high enough interest rate to make up for the risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another question mark is the future of long-term interest rates. Since Donald Trump's surprise election victory, mortgage rates have been surging. If the trend continues, it is likely to chill housing markets, making it harder for investors to quickly flip homes for a profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are only imprecise ways to measure home-flip default risks. The average foreclosure rate for loans secured by investment properties is 0.43% compared with 0.6% for loans on owner-occupied homes, but the foreclosure rate for investment property loans originated in 2016 is more than double owner-occupied homes, according to ATTOM.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finance companies say their loans to home flippers are prudent. LendingHome, for example, says it limits its average loan size to reduce risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big banks are offering lenders credit lines ranging from $5 million to $150 million, with interest rates between 3.5% and 6%, say the people familiar with the deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The banks say they are shielded from major losses because their loan deals are backed by pools of securitized loans, sheltering them from a potential bankruptcy of the lender.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 5 Arch deal with <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span>, the bank securitized 150 5 Arch loans in a $60 million bond, and then lent out a portion of that amount back to 5 Arch in what operates like a credit line. The bank can also sell pieces of the resulting bond to other investors if it chooses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ahead of any funding deal, bankers say they are spending weeks reviewing the underwriting process that lenders use, making sure borrowers will be able to repay their loans.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They take the new year seriously in Edinburgh, with a three-day street party, torch-lit parades and a morning-after plunge into the ice-cold River Forth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps 2017 will bring the same level of excitement to prime real estate in the Scottish capital after some dismal years. The recession was followed by the 2014 independence referendum and this year's Brexit vote[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/specialcoverage/eureferendum] to leave the <span class="companylink">European Union</span>, all of which rattled confidence in the housing market. But prices are finally creeping upward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average price for a home in Edinburgh is £231,103, or $283,855, up 1.9% compared with the previous year, according to November data from Britain's leading house-price monitor, the Land Registry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The outlook is brighter in Edinburgh's city center, where prices of prime real estate have already returned to prerecession levels, said Ben Fox, director of Savills Edinburgh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People are looking predominantly in the city center rather than the suburbs," Mr. Fox said. "I think there is a feeling it is a safer place to invest, and people like to be close to work and all the amenities of the city center."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By comparison, grand homes in the "wrong locations"—meaning more suburban areas—are still as much as 30% below peak levels, said Andrew Riddell, associate at <span class="companylink">Strutt &amp; Parker</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edinburgh's most desirable city-center neighborhood is New Town. This is the historic heart of the city, a picturesque network of Georgian streets and squares, with some of the city's best pubs, shops, bars and restaurants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently on the market is a classic townhouse on India Street, one of the most prestigious streets in New Town for offers over $2.76 million. The five-bedroom Georgian property measures 4,469 square feet, and has a walled backyard, plus a double garage with a self-contained two-bedroom apartment above it, according to the Knight Frank listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of New Town's townhouses have been converted to apartments, and a large two-bedroom apartment in New Town would cost $500,000 to $600,000, said James Whitson, director of Edinburgh sales for Rettie estate agents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For buyers in need of a larger home in New Town, <span class="companylink">Strutt &amp; Parker</span> is listing a four-bedroom, three-bathroom apartment in Drummond Place for offers over $1.1 million. The 4,034-square-foot property features a sauna and wine cellar, and has a large private backyard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers based in other European capital cities will likely note how reasonable these prices are by comparison. But despite Edinburgh's relative affordability, around 80% of Mr. Whitsun's sales are to local buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rest come from England and beyond, or are returning expats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those few outsiders who do buy in Edinburgh have to negotiate a system that is unique to Scotland. Before a home is listed, an independent surveyor draws up a valuation report that buyers are free to view. Then the property is listed, usually at 5% to 10% below the valuation price, with the expectation that offers would exceed that list price. Buyers register their interest in a property, and the selling agent sets a closing date. The buyers make sealed-bid offers by this date, then the homeowner chooses the winner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As well as paying for their property the winner will also have to pay a hefty tax. In April 2015, the Land and Buildings Transaction Tax was introduced by the Scottish government to replace the Stamp Duty, a buyers' tax levied in England and Wales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The LBTT is a bone of contention among agents, since it has increased the tax burden on homes that sell for more than £750,000, or about $925,000. The formula by which the LBTT is calculated is complex, but the purchase of a $1 million property would carry a tax liability of around $67,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For buyers looking for a second home or investment property, an extra 3% is added to the LBTT, increasing the tax on that $1 million property to nearly $100,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite these new, higher transaction costs, real-estate experts say prices will increase in prime Edinburgh in the short to medium term. This is partly because homes in the city center are in short supply—many owners have simply decided to sit tight and ride out the uncertainties of recent year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fox says Edinburgh will also tempt investors with its value for money, while affluent domestic buyers, including a burgeoning community of tech entrepreneurs, will be drawn to its sheer beauty and comfortable lifestyle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are still a lot of questions over Brexit, but once those things are a little clearer I think there will be a lot of investment in Edinburgh," said Mr. Riddell. "Companies which find London too expensive will relocate to Edinburgh."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median apartment prices in Manhattan set a record in 2016, but by other measures it was a tough year for residential real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as the median price of an apartment rose 9% this year, brokers said, the luxury market slumped. Fewer overall sales closed, and even fewer new contracts were signed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall sales declined, with significant drops in sales of co-ops and older condominiums, which make up 80% of all transactions. Despite the record overall, prices for those categories either fell or rose far more modestly, a Wall Street Journal analysis found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the price surge in 2016 was limited to purchases of apartments in new developments, with the large windows, high ceilings and designer kitchens coveted by many buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many of those deals were negotiated years ago, in a different market. In 2016, the number of sales contracts signed for more than $4 million fell 22%, according to data compiled by <span class="companylink">Olshan Realty Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The high-end luxury sector has been down and out in 2016," said Noah Rosenblatt, a broker who founded the real-estate data site urbandigs.com. He noted some signs of improvement had appeared since the presidential election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 432 Park Ave., near East 56th Street, a penthouse sold in September for $87.7 million, the fourth-highest apartment price ever. Over the course of the year, the building's developers, <span class="companylink">CIM Group</span> and Harry Macklowe, a New York developer, closed on 75 transactions with an average price of $19.7 million. Although these deals closed in 2016, they were negotiated over three or four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That helped lift the median price of Manhattan apartments by the 9%, to a record $1.08 million in 2016. The average price surged almost 15% to $2.04 million, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of <span class="companylink">New York City Department of Finance</span> records through Dec. 19.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the increase was far greater for new developments. As of Dec. 19, more than 2,300 apartment deals closed in new developments in 2016, the most in six years. The median price was $2.55 million, up 42% from new-building closings in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These included 182 transactions at Carnegie Park, a conversion of a rental development by Related Cos. on East 94th Street in Yorkville, at a median price of $1.44 million. Another development, Greenwich Lane on the site of the former St. Vincent's Medical Center in Greenwich Village, closed roughly 142 transactions at a median price of $6.2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the top 10 sales of 2016, five were at 432 Park Ave., and eight of 10 were in new developments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surge in new-development sales in Manhattan, which began in the second half of 2015, is already easing and is likely to slow further in the first half of 2017, brokers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rest of the market, meanwhile, faltered in 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Co-op sales were down 12.3% through Dec. 19. The median price was up 5.4% to $775,000 compared with 2015, but was down 3% since the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resales of older condominiums were down 7.6%, while the median price fell by 1.6% compared with 2015. Overall sales declined 6.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers and analysts attribute the slowdown in 2016 to uncertainty over the presidential election, buyer resistance to high asking prices, dips in the stock market early in the year and global economic uncertainty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hall Willkie, president of brokerage Brown Harris Stevens, said "gross overpricing" by many sellers has been a drag on sales, since buyers have been acutely price-sensitive since real-estate prices tumbled after the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Buyers want to know that the prices they are being asked to pay are justifiable based on recent property sales," he said. "Once you get outside that price range, properties sit."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the Election</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contract signings rose sharply</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">in weeks following the vote</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The uncertainty created by a polarizing national election cut into New York real-estate sales in 2016. But now that the campaign season is over, brokers expect sales to pick up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wealthy buyers in New York often delay discretionary purchases until they feel comfortable, said Hall Willkie, president of brokerage Brown Harris Stevens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That appears to be happening. In an early sign of progress, real-estate brokerage Compass found that the number of contracts signed in the two-week period beginning Nov. 26 far surpassed the number signed during the same period a year earlier. Overall in the quarter, the number lagged behind the same quarter in 2015 by 21%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The world exhaled because the election was behind us and life could move on," said Compass President Leonard Steinberg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Howard Lorber, chairman of brokerage <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>, said he expected a rebound next year, citing the strong stock market and promised tax cuts from President-elect Donald Trump. He said the cuts should stimulate real-estate buying even if interest rates keep rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Tax cuts make people feel richer at any price point," he said. "More spendable dollars equate to more expensive real estate."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CONGRESSIONAL CHAMBER</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawmakers Recording</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From Floor to Be Fined</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taking photographs and making audio or video recordings from the House floor is about to carry a financial price -- the consequence of a Democratic protest on the floor earlier this year that drew rebukes from Republicans for violating the chamber's customs and standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, House Republicans rolled out a package of new rules for the 115th Congress that would allow the House Sergeant at Arms to impose fines starting at $500 on lawmakers who use their phones or other devices to take pictures or make recordings from the House floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The House has long had a ban on such practices, though lawmakers could sometimes be seen openly flouting the rules, such as during State of the Union addresses when some members take selfies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the new rules package, lawmakers who engage in disorderly conduct, including blocking the well of the chamber or blocking access to the floor's microphone, can also be referred to the House Ethics Committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposed rules come in the wake of a high-profile protest last summer, when Democrats took over the House floor to force Republicans to schedule votes on gun-control measures.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOUTH CAROLINA</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gunman Won't Make</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Case in Penalty Phase</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charleston church gunman Dylann Roof will be representing himself when he makes an opening statement Tuesday in the sentencing phase of his death penalty trial, having already told the court he won't be calling witnesses or offering evidence on his mental condition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal prosecutors said Wednesday they would call roughly 30 witnesses to testify about the nine victims in last year's church shootings in the South Carolina city, a signal that the sentencing phase could be lengthy and emotional.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Roof, 22 years old, was found guilty of hate crimes and other charges on Dec. 15 in the racially motivated killings of nine black worshipers at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second phase of the trial will determine whether Mr. Roof, who is white, should be sentenced to death or to a term of life in prison. The same Charleston jury will be given that decision.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending Home Sales</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fell in November</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A gauge of coming home sales dropped in November, a sign of weakening momentum for the U.S. housing market headed into 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Wednesday that its pending home sales index, which tracks contracts signed for purchases of existing homes, fell 2.5% from October to a seasonally adjusted 107.3 last month. Sales typically close within a month or two of signing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This was a disappointment relative to expectations for an increase during the month and a more downbeat signal on housing activity than the move up in mortgage purchase application volumes that also occurred in November," J.P. Morgan Chase economist Daniel Silver said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a 0.5% rise in November. Instead, the index fell to its lowest level since January. Compared with November 2015, the index was down 0.4% last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, the trade group's chief economist, blamed the decline on a recent jump in mortgage rates combined with rising prices and tight inventory.</p>
