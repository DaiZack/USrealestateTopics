<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The U.S. economy grew only modestly in the final months of 2006, the government said, lowering its original estimate because of a smaller buildup in business inventories.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gross domestic product increased at a 2.2% annual rate in the three months ended Dec. 31, the U.S. Commerce Department said yesterday. Originally, growth was estimated at 3.5% for the three-month period.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report yesterday showed new-home sales plunged in January to the lowest level in nearly four years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new estimate of a 2.2% seasonally adjusted gain in GDP meant the economy was just a little stronger than in the third quarter, when it rose 2%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"After almost three years of above-average GDP growth, the economy has entered a new phase of below-average growth," said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics. "This is no random event or accident; it is the direct consequence of the 4.25 percentage points of Fed-led increases in short-term interest rates."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past two years, the U.S. Federal Reserve has raised its federal-funds rate target to 5.25% from 1% to prevent the economy from overheating and inflation from running amok.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price gauges within the GDP report suggest inflation is backing down. The price index for personal consumption excluding food and energy rose 1.9% in the fourth quarter. That is not only below a previously estimated 2.1% increase and lower than the third quarter's 2.2% climb, but also within the Fed's comfort zone of 1% to 2%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While the top-line growth numbers are a little weaker than is consistent with the Fed's forecast, Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues can take comfort in the fact that inflation is easing," said Global Insight chief economist Nariman Behravesh, referring to Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A big part of the downward revision to GDP was businesses making a smaller investment in inventories than previously thought. The GDP data showed businesses increased inventories by only $17.3 billion; originally, the Commerce Department had estimated a $35.3 billion increase.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Businesses had kept accumulating supply even though the economy was slowing. In the fourth quarter, companies lowered inventory growth in belated response to receding demand.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trade didn't give the fourth-quarter economy as big a boost as originally reported. U.S. exports rose 10.5%. Imports decreased 2.2%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A big drag on U.S. economic growth is the housing sector. Residential fixed investment, which includes spending on housing, plunged 19.1% in the fourth quarter.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Things weren't much better for the sector in the new year, a report yesterday showed. New-home sales fell 16.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 937,000 in January, the weakest sales rate since 936,000 in February 2003. The median home price fell to $239,800 from $244,900 a year earlier.   </p>

</div><div class="author">By Christopher Conkey </div><div>728 words</div><div>28 February 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Orders for computers, machinery and other durable goods plunged in January, an indication that this year's outlook for modest economic growth may be making businesses cautious about their capital-spending plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, existing-home sales rose last month as lower prices and generous incentives lured some buyers back into the market. But economists say it will be tough to determine whether the housing market has reached a bottom before the spring selling season arrives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said new orders for durable goods fell 7.8% in January following a 2.8% increase in December, largely because there were fewer orders for transportation equipment. Boeing Co., for example, received 39 orders for new planes in January, down from an unusually large 212 in December. After two exceptionally strong years in which it secured more than 1,000 new orders per year, the Chicago-based aerospace giant expects to receive roughly half that number this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists tend to ignore transportation-led fluctuations in overall durable goods orders as long as underlying measures are solid. But that wasn't the case with yesterday's data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders excluding transportation fell 3.1%, and orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft -- a closely watched proxy for future business investment -- dropped 6.0% last month, the second decline in three months. The data suggest many companies are hesitant to plow their profits into such growth-enabling investments as structures and equipment, a trend that emerged late last year and appears to be continuing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We started to see some signs late in 2006 that the momentum in business equipment investment wasn't as bullish as it was earlier in the year," said Brian Bethune, U.S. economist at consulting firm Global Insight. "Now the momentum has diminished."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After increasing at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 7.7% in the third quarter last year, business investment in equipment and software fell at a 1.8% rate in the fourth quarter. Today, the government will release its updated estimate of the economy's fourth-quarter growth, and economists expect the initial tally of a 3.5% inflation-adjusted growth rate to be lowered to between 2% and 2.5%, mostly because of weaker-than-expected inventory accumulation and higher imports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John J. Castellani, president of the Business Roundtable, whose members are big-company chief executives, said concerns over the future course of economic growth are making some companies cautious. These worries have been reflected in the group's quarterly surveys of CEOs. In December, 39% of CEOs surveyed said their company's capital spending would increase over the next six months, down from 56% a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If sustained, weak business spending would impose another drag on the economy at a time when pullbacks in residential investment and manufacturing production are already weighing on growth. It would also come as a surprise to economists since most have assumed businesses will spend freely after a year of record-breaking profit margins. Federal Reserve policy makers are also forecasting solid gains in capital spending this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the National Association of Realtors said existing-home sales rose 3.0% in January to a rate of 6.46 million units, or 4.3% below year-ago levels. The median sales price was $210,600 last month, down 3.1% from a year earlier. The inventory of unsold homes on the market was unchanged last month at a 6.6-month supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The combination of lower prices, reasonable interest rates and warm weather spurred home buying activity in January, and a cold spell in February could depress sales. The key question is whether buyers will come out in force this spring, enabling sellers to lift prices and builders to reduce unsold inventories without further production cuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We shouldn't be surprised to see a near-term sales dip, but that will be followed by continuing recovery in home sales," predicted David Lereah, the Realtors' chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Conference Board, a New York-based research group, said its index of consumer confidence rose to 112.5 this month from 110.2 in January, as consumers' assessments of economic conditions, including the availability of jobs, improved. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. demand for durable goods tumbled in January, falling more than double the rate expected as orders for airplanes plunged.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, U.S. existing-home sales increased in January to the highest level in seven months, but prices took a tumble.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for durable goods fell 7.8% last month to a seasonally adjusted $203.90 billion, the U.S. Commerce Department said. The median estimate of 21 economists surveyed Dow Jones Newswires by had durables just 3.2% lower in January. Durables rose 2.8% in December, revised from a previously estimated 2.9% increase.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A key barometer of business-equipment spending -- orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft -- fell by 6%, after increasing 3.6% in December.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growth of durable goods in manufacturers' inventories slowed in January, rising 0.3% after climbing 0.7% in December, yesterday's data showed. The Institute for Supply Management's index of manufacturing activity, a key indicator of the sector's health, showed contraction in January. The gauge moved to 49.3 from a reading of 51.4 for December. Readings above 50 point to expansion in activity; readings below 50 suggests contraction.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other economic news, the Conference Board, a private research group, said U.S. consumer confidence rose in February to its highest level in more than five years. The confidence index increased to 112.5 this month, a bigger-than-expected rise from a January reading of 110.2. The gain reflected increased optimism about jobs and business prospects.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home resales rose to an annual rate of 6.46 million, a 3% increase from December's revised 6.27 million annual pace, the National Association of Realtors said. December's rate was originally estimated at 6.22 million.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home price was $210,600 in January, compared with $221,600 in December and $217,400 in January 2006. NAR chief economist David Lereah said unseasonably warm weather helped boost sales.   </p>

</div><div class="author">By Christopher Conkey in Washington and James R. Hagerty in Pittsburgh  </div><div>727 words</div><div>19 February 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sharp drop-off in new-home construction in the U.S. is adding to concerns that the housing downturn's impact could linger well into this year and may eventually seep into the wider economy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders slashed construction of new homes last month to the lowest level in nearly a decade, a move that underscores the severity of the sector's slump and signals it will likely continue to be a drag on the economy at least through midyear. While lower production among builders has already slowed economic growth, stagnant or declining prices in many markets have coincided with an uptick in delinquencies among the riskiest mortgage borrowers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monthly home-construction readings are volatile and prone to weather-induced fluctuations, and last month's plunge may somewhat overstate the market weakness. Yet in discussing the risks, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke last week said the "spillover effects from developments in the housing market onto consumer spending . . . may be more pronounced than expected."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big concern is that a deeper housing slump would begin to restrict consumers' spending -- the dominant driver of U.S. economic growth -- by making them feel less wealthy and limiting their ability to tap the equity built up in their homes to finance purchases. The slip in homebuilding last year subtracted more than one percentage point from inflation-adjusted economic growth over the second half of 2006.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a possible silver lining: The plunge in new homebuilding activity in January -- down 14.3% from December and 37.8% from January 2006 levels -- could eventually hasten a recovery by reducing the overhang of unsold homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the weakness in housing hasn't spilled over significantly to consumer spending. Instead, it has slowed the pace of expansion just enough to reverse last year's inflation surge. Still, the possibility of further deterioration in the sector remains a risk to economic growth -- particularly if it is accompanied by rising loan defaults or a broad tightening of credit standards.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, defaults and late payments have remained very low on prime mortgages, which are made to lower-risk borrowers and account for the bulk of home loans. But late payments have risen swiftly over the past year on subprime mortgages -- those made to risky borrowers with spotty credit histories -- and on "Alt-A" mortgages, a category between prime and subprime which includes many loans for which borrowers haven't documented their income. According to trade publication Inside Mortgage Finance, 13% of mortgages outstanding are subprime.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November, payments were at least 60 days overdue on 12.9% of subprime loans packaged into mortgage securities, up from 8.1% a year earlier, according to First American LoanPerformance, a research firm in San Francisco. For Alt-A loans, the delinquency rate jumped to 2.1% in November from 1.1%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surge in late payments and delinquencies has created turbulence among subprime lenders, and some large banks that bought subprime loans a couple of years ago have been pressuring subprime-mortgage lenders to buy them back. In its most recent survey of senior loan officers, released earlier this month, the Fed found that some banks are getting more stringent to guard against the threat of defaults. About 18% of domestic banks reported that they had tightened credit standards on residential-mortgage loans over the past three months, the Fed said, adding that this was "the highest net fraction posted since the early 1990s."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moves to tighten credit standards could "create another leg down" in home sales and prices by making it harder for financially stretched buyers to get home loans, said Ivy Zelman, a Cleveland-based housing analyst for Credit Suisse Group. She also warned that rising foreclosures will cause more homes to be put on the market, further weighing on prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed officials and many other economists say the problems in subprime lending aren't severe enough at this point to significantly hamper economic growth. Doug Duncan, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association, a Washington-based trade group, said only 6% of homeowners have subprime, adjustable-rate mortgages.  </p>

Doug Duncan, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association, a Washington-based trade group, said only 6% of homeowners have subprime, adjustable-rate mortgages. Even if one-tenth of these end up in foreclosure -- the peak hit after the 2001 recession -- Mr. Duncan said that "it's hard to see how that can be a macroeconomic event."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Concern would rise if troubles spread further among lower-risk borrowers and lead to more defaults of Alt-A mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another risk is that many subprime loans were made to buy houses in high-priced areas, which may be more vulnerable to price declines. Any widespread delinquencies on these loans could result in lenders seizing the underlying homes and dumping them on the market. That could exacerbate the industry's inventory problem, which has already put downward pressure on prices and forced builders to increase discounts and incentives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Torn between yesterday's housing report's implications of slower growth and diminished inflationary pressure -- which makes additional interest-rate increases less likely -- stocks were virtually unchanged yesterday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose three points to close at 12768.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pat Moroney, who heads the Phoenix division of Standard Pacific Homes, a California-based home builder, said sales-cancellation rates in Phoenix soared as high as 70% at times last year, and averaged 50% for the year as a whole. The company has been offering incentives to potential buyers between $15,000 and $100,000 to help move unsold homes in some markets, up from $5,000 to $10,000 in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We worked pretty hard to get through our backlog" of unsold homes, Mr. Moroney said. "We've pushed a lot of cancellations through." In January, the cancellation rate fell to 32%, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the stockpile of unsold homes, many industry officials and economists greeted the sharp drop in new-home construction last month as welcome news. "I think it's a positive indicator," said Ara K. Hovnanian, chief executive officer of Hovnanian Enterprises Inc., a large home builder based in Red Bank, N.J. He said the figures reflect a decrease in new-home orders over the past year and will help builders clear their inventories, paving the way for a gradual recovery to begin later this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say the sooner builders cut back, the sooner a rebound can occur. "We look at this number, and it makes us a bit more optimistic about when we're going to see a recovery," said Todd Vencil, a housing analyst at BB&amp;T Capital Markets in Richmond, Va.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists had expected housing starts to decline in January, a natural retreat amid the cold weather following the fourth quarter's warm spell. But the 14.3% drop in starts to the lowest level in nearly 10 years was much sharper expected. The report prompted economists to peer into the housing slump and contemplate its elusive bottom. Some economists noted signs of stabilization despite what some referred to as the "noisy" headline number. Following are some economists' reactions. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--- </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much weaker than expected report. The payback we expected to emerge over the course of the first quarter as the artificial boost to activity over the course of the fourth quarter from the unusually warm weather was reversed appears to have come through right away in January . . . Based on these results, we cut our forecast for residential investment in the first quarter and reduced our GDP forecast to +3.4% from +3.6%. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- David Greenlaw, Ted Wieseman, Morgan Stanley Research </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--- </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We didn't really believe the reported increase in December starts and we are equally inclined not to take too seriously the reported January plunge. The starts numbers are hugely volatile even when weather conditions are normal for the time of year, but that has not been the case in the past couple of months. The permits data are less affected by the weather, and the downtrend there seems to be over, at least for now. Another stable month in Feb would confirm the shift. Ultimately, this is more important than the noisy starts numbers, even though the latter appear more supportive of our medium-term bearish growth view. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Ian Shepherdson, High Frequency Economics </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--- </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[T]his decline was aggravated by harsh winter weather. However, because of the shifting weather patterns, it may be better to average the last three months, which would be about 1.54 million. Sales of new homes appear to be stabilizing; with inventories of unsold new home still elevated, housing starts will stay weak but not necessarily continue to contract. Nevertheless, housing contribution to economic growth will be substantially negative again in the first quarter. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Steven Wood, Insight Economics </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--- </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can't blame this one entirely on the weather, and we continue to maintain the worst is NOT over for housing. . . . Single family starts, and permits, reflect the lingering glut of unsold homes remaining on the market. Moreover, . . . there is still a considerable amount of new supply still hitting the market . . . inventory problems are only going to intensify over the coming months. Adding to the mix is the fact that mortgage lenders have apparently seen the light and are tightening lending standards. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--Richard Moody, Mission Residential </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--- </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although housing starts will probably remain weak in 2007 (permits in January were 29% below the year-ago level), as builders continue to scale back activity in order to keep a lid on supply, housing demand continues to show tentative signs of stabilization. The MBA purchase gauge in January remained around a historically high level of 400, while the NAHB housing market index in February rose by five points to 40, its highest level since last summer. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Omair Sharif, RBS Greenwich Capital </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--- </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyone who wants to sugar-coat the housing industry's state of affairs [had] better look at this morning's housing-starts report. Construction of new single-family and multifamily properties plunged 14.3% to an annualized rate of 1.408 million units from 1.643 million units in December. The year-over-year drop was even more dramatic -- 38%. Not only was January's starts figure well below the forecast for 1.6 million, it is the WORST TO DATE for the down cycle in housing. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Mike Larson, Weiss Research </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--- </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[T]he slowdown in housing will leave appliance and building supply manufacturers eager to entice retail customers with good deals. Moderate growth in consumer incomes and falling housing prices will force apparel retailers to price aggressively to attract customers. . . . Prices for new and existing homes have moderated, not collapsed, . . . Once completed, the housing adjustment should promote healthy growth and moderate inflation less dependent on consumer borrowing. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Peter Morici, University of Maryland </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--- </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weakness in January was in all the regions which had experienced the biggest boom in building. Only in the Northeast was there slightly more building in January. It was the area that participated least in the boom and where the contraction in the past year has been smallest. Home completions have fallen only 8% over the past year. The gap between this lagging indicator of activity and starts helps explain why construction jobs have not fallen commensurately with new starts. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices declined from a year earlier in about half of all metropolitan areas in the fourth quarter, the National Association of Realtors reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the first time the trade group has recorded declining or unchanged prices in the majority of cities covered since it began collecting the data in 1979, a Realtors spokesman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a national basis, the median home price during the quarter was $219,300, down 2.7% from a year earlier. Prices began falling in many areas last year after a boom that pushed prices up at double-digit annual rates in much of the country in the first half of this decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the latest quarter, the median price declined in 73 metro areas, increased in 71 and was flat in five. The biggest decrease was in the Sarasota-Bradenton-Venice area of Florida, down 18% from a year before. Many of the biggest decliners were in Florida, where a glut of new condominiums is weighing on the market, and in Rust Belt cities like Youngstown and Toledo, Ohio, hurt by shrinking industrial employment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest increase was in Atlantic City, N.J., up 26%. Paul Striefsky, a broker at Vanguard Property Group, which operates in the Atlantic City area, said a new wave of upscale casino-related development has brought in more buyers of both second homes and primary residences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Older homes in Atlantic City are being replaced by much more expensive ones, skewing the price data, added Jeffrey Otteau, president of Otteau Valuation Group Inc., an appraisal firm in East Brunswick, N.JMany in the housing industry hope prices will level off or start edging up by this year's second half. Employment remains fairly strong and mortgage rates low. "Hopefully, the fourth quarter was the bottom of this current business cycle," said David Lereah, the Realtors' chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a glut of new homes continues to weigh on prices in many areas, and lenders are becoming more stringent in their credit standards amid a rise in late payments and defaults. Those defaults are expected to increase the supply of foreclosed homes dumped on the market. The tougher credit standards will prevent some potential buyers from obtaining loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the National Association of Home Builders said its index for sales of new single-family homes, a measure of confidence among builders, rose to 40 in February from 35 in January. The latest reading was the highest since June. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower Energy Costs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Likely to Help the PPI</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The producer-price index, which measures inflation at the wholesale level, will be released for January. Forecasts call for the PPI to drop 0.6%, after an increase of 0.9% in December, reflecting a drop in both gasoline and natural-gas prices. Stripping out the volatile food and energy components, the core PPI is expected to rise a modest 0.2%. The Labor Department is due to release the January PPI at 8:30 a.m. EST.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing Starts</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">May Slide Further</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reports on January housing starts and building permits, important barometers for the real-estate market. The pace of starts is forecast to have fallen about 2.6% from December's annualized rate of 1.64 million. Starts are off 28% from January 2006's 33-year high rate of 2.27 million, but some home builders say they are seeing signs of the market beginning to stabilize. Data released at 8:30 a.m. EST.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some Markets Plan</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early Close for Holiday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bond market and some commodities trading will wind up early, ahead of the three-day Presidents Day holiday weekend. Trading in most commodities will finish at 1 p.m. EST and bonds at 2 p.m. U.S. stock markets will stick to their regular trading schedule. All U.S. financial markets will be closed Monday for the holiday, while markets throughout Asia -- Japan excepted -- close for the Lunar New Year, which begins Sunday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- Home mortgage rates edged slightly higher during the past week, said housing-finance agency Freddie Mac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average for 30-year fixed mortgage rates in the week ended yesterday rose to 6.30% from 6.28% a week earlier. A year ago, the rate averaged 6.28%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average for 15-year fixed-rate mortgages was 6.03%, barely higher than the 6.02% average of one week ago, and up from the year-earlier 5.91%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five-year Treasury-indexed hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages were 6.01%, up from 5.99% the previous week and the year-ago 5.95%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One-year Treasury-indexed ARMs also rose slightly to 5.52% from last week's average of 5.49% and the year-ago 5.36%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While rates were little changed in the past week, noted Frank Nothaft, Freddie Mac vice president and chief economist, the coming week's indicators including January's housing starts, producer prices and consumer prices "will be the first indicators of the housing market and inflation in early 2007, and we could see interest rates move in response."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes listed for sale in 18 major U.S. metropolitan areas at the end of January was up 2.55% from a month earlier, according to data compiled by ZipRealty Inc., a national real-estate brokerage firm based in Emeryville, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The modest increase comes amid a glut of homes on the market in much of the country. Home prices have been leveling off or declining in recent months in many areas, and they are unlikely to bounce back until inventories come down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ZipRealty data cover listings of single-family homes, condominiums and town houses on local multiple-listing services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories of previously occupied homes typically increase in January as sellers who took their properties off the market during the holidays try to get an early start on the spring selling season, the busiest time of the year for home shopping. Over the past two decades, national inventories in January typically have increased about 8% from a month earlier, according to Credit Suisse Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas Lawler, a housing economist in Vienna, Va., says early signs suggest inventory buildup was moderate last month. But, he says, "it's too early to tell whether that's a big plus" for the market because there are little data available yet on January sales. There is a huge supply of new homes available in many areas, and rising foreclosures will result in lenders dumping more houses on the market, says Mr. Lawler.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many homes on the market are vacant, a situation that usually means owners are more eager to sell and willing to negotiate on price. The Census Bureau reported last week there were about 2.1 million vacant homes for sale in last year's fourth quarter. That put the national homeowner vacancy rate at 2.7%, up from 2% a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ronald Peltier, chief executive of HomeServices of America Inc., a chain based in Minneapolis that owns brokerages in 19 states, says he is "cautiously optimistic." Sales handled by his company in January were about level with a year earlier and prices were little changed. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. productivity growth rebounded during the fourth quarter, relieving pressures on labor costs and suggesting America's economy still has the potential to generate strong growth without igniting inflation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the National Association of Realtors said that after bottoming out in the fourth quarter, U.S. sales of existing homes are expected to rise over the coming two years, while sales of new homes and construction will remain subdued. A slowdown in the housing market damped economic growth last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Productivity in the nonfarm business sector rose at a 3% rate in the final quarter of last year, the Labor Department reported yesterday. That was a sharp improvement from a revised 0.1% decline in the third quarter, which was originally reported as a 0.2% gain.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This solid performance indicates the growth potential of the U.S. economy remains formidable and greater than economists and policy makers have been inclined to acknowledge," said Peter Morici, professor at the University of Maryland, in a research note.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weakness in the second and third quarters of 2006 limited U.S. productivity growth for the year as a whole to 2.1%, the slowest annual growth pace since 1997.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unit labor costs -- a gauge of inflationary pressures -- rose by just 1.7% in the fourth quarter, down from an upwardly revised 3.2% in the third quarter. They were up 2.8% from a year earlier and up 3.2% on average for 2006 as a whole.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the real-estate front, the NAR expects existing-home sales to reach 6.44 million this year and 6.64 million the following year. For all of 2006, existing-home sales hit 6.48 million. New-home sales, after reaching 1.06 million in 2006, are projected to decline to 961,000 this year and rise to 971,000 in 2008.  </p>

</p><div>THE OUTLOOK</div>
<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Vacant Homes For Sale Cloud Economic Hopes --- Data Pointing to Glut, Are Worst in Decades Impact of Speculators</span>
</div><div class="author">By Michael Corkery </div><div>1235 words</div><div>5 February 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid brightening hopes that the U.S. housing market is stabilizing, some economists are zeroing in on a piece of data that could augur badly for the consensus view: the homeowner vacancy rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That figure, an often-overlooked measure of how many homes for sale in the country are empty, has climbed to its highest level since the Census Bureau began tracking it four decades ago. Last week, the bureau said that in the final three months of 2006 there were about 2.1 million vacant homes for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That brought the national homeowner vacancy rate to 2.7%, up from 2.0% a year earlier. Before 2006, the number had never risen above 2.0%. Like the housing economy more broadly, the measure varies by region: The South had a homeowner vacancy rate of 3.0%, the Midwest had a rate of 2.9%, the West had a 2.4% rate and the Northeast had a rate of 2.0%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report, which usually gets little attention, sparked fresh concerns about the housing market. Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius concluded in a report last Monday that rising vacancies signal that excess housing supply continues to grow -- and that new construction has to decline further this year, even after a 13% decline in new home starts in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meantime, J.P. Morgan economist Haseeb Ahmed said the overhang of vacant housing stock could erode existing home values as sellers slash prices to move their vacant properties. Economists fear that many vacant homes are owned by speculators who are stuck with investment properties that they can't sell and may be under increasing pressure to drop their prices. "We are concerned that there could be downward pressure on prices for awhile," Mr. Ahmed says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such worries could cloud hopes for a swift housing rebound. Those hopes have been bolstered recently by signs that the market may be stabilizing. Sales, which fell sharply through much of last year, have leveled off in many metropolitan areas and mortgage applications have been rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also upbeat was a report two weeks ago from the National Association of Realtors that the supply of existing homes for sale declined during the final two months of 2006. That was greeted as a positive sign for housing because a decrease in supply tends to lead to firmer prices. But the NAR figures count both vacant and owner-occupied homes for sale -- and inventory levels for owner-occupied homes can fall not just because the home is sold, but also if sellers remove the property from the market because they didn't receive desirable offers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The homeowner vacancy-rate increase "does temper your outlook" for new construction, says David Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders in Washington. Mr. Seiders is forecasting largely flat housing sales this year followed by a strong rebound in housing starts in 2008. "There clearly are uncertainties about how this is going to work its way out," says Mr. Seiders. "I keep preaching to builders it's not time to ramp up production."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ahmed of J.P. Morgan says the homeowner vacancy rate calculates vacant homes that are residential year-round, and is supposed to exclude homes that are used occasionally as vacation homes, which have been growing in number in recent years. He says it's possible the vacancy rate may have captured some of these seasonal properties inadvertently. The high vacancy rate also may have been affected by the active 2005 hurricane season that forced residents to flee the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another factor that may have contributed to the high vacancies, says Mr. Hatzius of Goldman: newly constructed homes that are finished and awaiting occupants, but haven't sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vacancy indicator may help distinguish between the sellers who have casually listed their house on the market to see what price they can fetch, versus sellers who are under real pressure to sell. The owner of a vacant home -- who may be squeezed by mortgage payments for the vacant home as well as a current residence -- could be more willing to drop the price to minimize the cost, than a homeowner who lives in the home and doesn't have to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jon Estridge, 34 years old, owned a pair of investment homes in Virginia that sat empty for several months last year. When the market slowed, it was difficult not only to find buyers, but also to find tenants who would pay enough rent to cover his mortgages. "It eats you alive," said Mr. Estridge, who works for the federal government. "The market is going down, and you are paying a mortgage."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He eventually sold one home last spring, after dropping the price. He bought the property for $395,000 and sold for about $35,000 less. The other home sold for $260,000 in late August after he dropped the price by about $30,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, so far prices have fallen in relatively few markets. In fact, median home prices nationally were up 1.1% in 2006, according to the NAR. And last week, the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement that "recent indicators have suggested somewhat firmer economic growth, and some tentative signs of stabilization have appeared in the housing market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists agree, however, that rising vacancies have likely been fueled by a group that is proving to be the wild card of this housing market: speculators. During the boom, they flooded the market and flipped homes for a profit. When sales slowed, speculators were stuck with vacant homes that have lingered on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's no doubt speculators had a major impact, but their numbers have been difficult to quantify. The recent vacancy data may be a useful measure of speculative activity and its fallout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think a persuasive case can be made that the reason we are seeing such extraordinarily excessive vacancy is because of the heavy investor demand over the past few years," said Richard DeKaser, chief economist at National City Corp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's troubling is that speculators may not act like typical home sellers. When they sell their vacant home in a down market, they don't necessarily purchase another home. By contrast, people selling the homes they live in will most often buy another house -- thus fueling a healthy market of buying and selling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not surprisingly, buildings with five or more units -- which include condos that were magnets for speculators -- had the highest rate of vacancy. The vacancy rate among these units rose to 11% in the fourth quarter from 7% in the first quarter. For single-family homes, the vacancy rate rose to 2.3% in the fourth quarter from 1.8% in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hatzius expects homeowner vacancies will slow, as builders cut back on production and owners convert their units to rentals to take advantage of rising rents. But then again, the housing market has been full of surprises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This whole thing has been new," says Mr. Seiders, the National Association of Home Builders' economist. "We've never seen this kind of investor activity and we've never seen this kind of [vacancy] resale. It's an extra complication moving forward." </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The manufacturing and housing sectors exhibited some unexpected strength in December, although economists were cautious about both reports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported that new orders for durable goods -- things like refrigerators and airplanes that are meant to last three years or more -- rose 3.1% in December from a month earlier. A surge in aircraft orders accounted for a large part of the gain, but orders for "core" capital goods excluding defense and aircraft were also up at a good clip. That category, which counts everything from telephones to machine tools and is viewed as a measure of business investment, rose 2.4% in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, some economists warned against reading too much into one month's data. Overall, manufacturing remains in a tough patch: In the fourth quarter, orders for core capital goods fell at an annualized rate of 6.1%, the largest drop in nearly three years. Also, other survey data on new orders have suggested the current quarter could be weak, said Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist at consultancy MFR Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was a very solid report, but it's kind of inconclusive about where we're headed," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the Commerce Department said that new-home sales recovered in December, rising 4.8% from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.12 million units. But many economists cautioned that the monthly number may have been exaggerated. For one, unusually warm weather in December may have confounded seasonal adjustments meant to compensate for lower activity in winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures also do not take into account the high number of buyers canceling contracts on homes. In addition, say economists, the 1.5% drop in the median home price in December to $235,000 from a year ago may understate the actual size of the price decline because it does not factor in the generous incentives that builders are offering buyers to sell homes. Incentives can be indicative of further weakness in the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have yet to see any meaningful evidence of a sustainable recovery in the housing market," said Ian McCarthy, chief executive of Atlanta-based Beazer Homes USA, which reported a loss in its fiscal first quarter that ended Dec. 31.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the full year, new-home sales fell 17.3% in 2006, the largest decline since 1990. Home builders sold roughly 1.1 million new homes last year. On Thursday, the National Association of Realtors said that sales of existing, or preowned, homes fell 8.4% to 6.48 million. Taken together, sales of new and existing homes totaled 7.54 million units last year, down 9.78% from about 8.36 million units in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The uncertain outlook for housing contrasts sharply with an overall economy that has recently exceeded forecasters' expectations. Positive data on consumer spending and job growth, reinforced by the upbeat report on capital-goods orders, have increased economists' confidence that the expansion will maintain momentum this year as drags from housing and manufacturing ease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The interplay between housing and the economy also remains a key issue for Federal Reserve policy makers. They expect the housing slump to offset strength in other areas of the economy just enough to keep inflation on the cooling trend it has exhibited in recent months. That, in turn, would allow the Fed to hold short-term interest rates at their current level of 5.25%. As of Friday, futures markets put more than nine in ten odds on the Fed holding rates steady through at least July. </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes sales in 2006 tumbled at the fastest pace in 17 years, although economists believe the worst of the housing correction may have passed and sales could start to rebound later this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing, or previously owned, homes fell 0.8% in December from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.22 million units. For all of 2006, sales of existing homes totaled 6.48 million. That was down 8.4% from 2005 and was the largest annual decline since 1989, when rising interest rates and relatively high unemployment fueled a housing recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even after last year's sharp drop, 2006 was the third-strongest year for home sales since the NAR began tracking sales in 1968. And prices managed to move slightly higher in 2006; the existing-home median price was up 1.1% to $222,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have to remember how strong and some might say overheated the housing market was in 2005 in terms of sales and investor demand," said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist of PNC Financial Services Group in Pittsburgh. Last year showed a big drop as a whole "but to a level that frankly is still reasonably active with over six million home sales."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of condominiums and cooperatives led the decline for the year, falling 10.4% to 803,000 units. Sales of single-family homes were off 8.1% to 5.68 million. However, data for the month of December suggested that the condominium market may be starting to recover, and at a faster pace than the market for single-family homes. Condominium sales rose 2.1% in December compared with the previous month as sales of single-family homes declined 1.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although sales were down across the nation in December, the biggest year-over-year declines occurred in the West, where sales plunged 15.5%. December sales were down 7.1% in the South from a year earlier, 5.5% in the Northeast and 5.8% in the Midwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For 2007, many economists predict that sales will continue to fall, but at a more modest pace and with most of the decline occurring in the first half of the year. "The biggest drop is probably behind us," said Fannie Mae's chief economist, David Berson. "But it's still too soon to say this is unambiguously the bottom."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forecasts for 2007 vary widely. David Lereah, NAR's chief economist, foresees a modest sales decline of 1.2% this year. Mr. Berson expects existing-home sales to drop 7% to 8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steven Wieting, an economist at Citigroup, said that while the housing market is showing some signs of stabilizing, a significant slowdown in housing-related industries like furniture and appliances may yet come. "Everything in a housing cycle doesn't turn at once," he said. "Lagging indicators will weaken as much as the leading indicators already did."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Labor Department reported that new claims for unemployment insurance jumped 36,000 to 325,000 in the week ended Jan. 20. Claims had been below the 300,000 level -- which economists consider a benchmark for very tight labor markets -- the previous two weeks. The Jan. 13 reading was revised to 289,000 from a previously reported level of 290,000.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END) </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AS THE NATIONAL housing market continues to weaken, prices of homes in the $1 million range are slumping in many parts of the country. In once-golden Sunbelt cities like Miami and Santa Barbara, Calif., as well as in major Midwestern cities like St. Louis and Chicago, prices fell in the fourth quarter of 2006 from a year earlier, in some places by as much as 7.2%. In other areas, prices rose slightly but appreciation was sluggish, with gains of 4.3% or less. Still, analysts say, the category is holding up better than the overall market, which declined 10% during the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are some of the results of an exclusive report done for The Wall Street Journal by the National Association of Home Builders. "The million-dollar market is slowing down," says NAHB's director of research, Gopal Ahluwalia, who conducted the analysis using information from First American Real Estate Solutions, a Santa Ana, Calif., data provider.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report looked at sales of new and existing single-family homes costing between $750,000 and $1.25 million in the nation's top metro areas. In 2005's fourth quarter, 65 metro markets had 100 or more sales in that price range. A year later, that figure had dropped by more than half, to 32. And appreciation was generally lackluster. Nearly half of those 32 markets saw prices in this "starter luxury" market flatten or decline during the fourth quarter over the same period a year earlier, in some areas by as much as 7.2%. Overall, the median price of these 32 markets rose a modest 1.4%, to $890,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, median home prices during the same period fell 10%, to $225,000 from $250,000 the study showed. The National Association of Realtors, which tracks existing-home prices only and will release its fourth-quarter report Feb. 15, is projecting that overall median prices will drop just 3.9%, to $216,500, in the fourth quarter of 2006. (NAHB says its figures differ from those of NAR because they use different geographical boundaries for their metropolitan areas and include data from both new and existing homes.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts say that the million-dollar market is doing better than the overall market because it wasn't quite as overrun with investors during the boom. "There were more buyers trying to move up rather than make a killing," Mr. Ahluwalia says. Because investors make their money by reselling properties quickly, they're more likely to cut their losses -- and their prices -- as soon as they detect a market slowdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, a million dollars today doesn't go as far as it did even a few years ago, before residential real estate in many cities experienced double-digit price increases during the boom. Michael Patterson, a Sotheby's real-estate broker in Santa Barbara, Calif., says that as recently as 2001, $1 million would get you an oceanfront estate. Now it will get you a remodeled two-bedroom house built more than a half-century ago. In Dallas, meanwhile, it will buy a brand-new, four-bedroom lakefront home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It used to seem like a lot of money, Mr. Patterson says, the entry point to luxury. "It doesn't have the mystique that it used to," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor are today's million-dollar-home customers the same as those of five or six years ago. Then, they tended to be cash-rich buyers who were mostly immune to mortgage-interest-rate fluctuations. But during the run-up, as more ordinary homes were pushed into the million-dollar range, those wealthy buyers moved up too, to the "super-luxury" level of $3 million and above. They were replaced by middle-income buyers, some of whom were hoping to cash in on the boom and who stretched to trade up using creative financing like option adjustable rate mortgages -- which allow borrowers to decide how much they're going to pay each month -- and interest-only loans. Now, many are "stuck" with homes whose prices are flat or declining, according to University of Maryland business professor Peter Morici.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sunbelt cities that attracted droves of buyers and builders during the boom have fared poorly. Overheated and overbuilt markets finally slowed down by the end of 2006: prices fell 4.2%, to $876,250, in Miami and flattened in Phoenix at $887,660 and in Charleston, S.C., at $937,500. Some Midwestern markets also performed badly. Prices were down 3.3% in Chicago, due in part to the loss of manufacturing jobs there. Things were even worse in St. Louis, which lost 3,300 jobs in the year ending November, second nationally only to Detroit. Prices in St. Louis were down 7.2%, the largest decline in the survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starter luxury homes are doing best in coastal cities where strong local economies support the incomes needed to buy them. The study's highest price increase, 4.3%, was in the Santa Ana-Anaheim-Irvine area of California, which has seen a steady rise in employment over the past year, particularly in the professional- and financial-services sectors, and the highest wage increases in three years. On the East Coast, fat year-end bonuses at many Wall Street firms fed a buying spree in the suburbs of New York, where prices increased almost as much, to 4.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, the survey showed a return to a buyer's market in the million-dollar range. But in some places, like San Francisco, where prices have remained high for years -- the overall median is $740,000, compared with the median price of $870,000 in the city's "million-dollar" category -- buyers aren't rushing in. Fatigued by years of fruitless house-hunting, they "can't quite believe" that the market has finally turned in their favor, according to broker Linda Harrison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vienna, Va., housing economist Tom Lawler says buyer hesitation is also being fueled by the change in mentality from a speculative market to one based more on need. During the boom, many buyers bought the biggest house that they could because they saw that as a way to increase their investment in real estate without buying rental property. But now that the market is softening, that strategy no longer makes much sense. Lawyer Beth Joffe and her husband, a physician, recently sold their three-bedroom Chicago home for $760,000 and have moved to a much smaller two-bedroom condo in Madison, Wis., that they bought for $300,000. Though both are far from retirement age, neither wants the hassle or added expense of a bigger place. "We don't need that any more," Ms. Joffe says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agents say that in many cities, the shifting psychology is causing sellers to reverse their tactics. During the run-up, sellers usually priced their homes slightly above the market knowing that someone would buy them, even if the price tag later had to be lowered somewhat. Now sellers are trying to undercut the market to sell while their listings are still fresh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's especially true in relatively new "semi-</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">custom" subdivisions, where many homes, though chock-full of amenities like built-in wine racks and tumbled-stoned backsplashes, tend to look alike. In St. Louis, Steve Shadrach has just listed his five-bedroom, brick-and-stone-front home with a swimming pool, which he bought more than two years ago for $770,000, for $949,000. If he finds a buyer at that price, he'll make a substantial profit. But his asking price is nearly $50,000 less than a nearby neighbor is asking for a nearly identical property, and about $100,000 less than what his builder is charging to build the same house. "I'd like to price it higher, but I have to compete with them," says Mr. Shadrach, a plastics salesman who wants to move closer to his grandchildren.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, a surfeit of new homes in central New Jersey is partly responsible for the significant price declines in Edison, where prices of starter luxury houses fell 6.7% in the fourth quarter from the year earlier. Coldwell Banker has a $949,900 listing of a "new" five-bedroom brick house that was actually built in 2005, but interested buyers are few. "People are going for less house," says Joe Thomas, an agent with Coldwell Banker. "They're not stretching any more."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many parts of Southern California, prices are still on the upswing, although analysts such as Celia Chen, director of housing economics at Moody's Investor Service's Economy.com, says the area is at "high risk" for a fall. Although the local economy is strong, incomes haven't kept pace with the sizzling double-digit price increases these markets experienced from 2001 to 2005. And with federal regulators pressuring lenders to cut back on creative financing, fewer buyers are able to stretch their incomes to buy million-dollar homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's what banker David Jaffe discovered when he put his five-bedroom stucco home in Ventura, Calif., on the market 2 1/2 months ago for $979,900. Ventura's prices are still rising -- they increased 4% from 2005 to 2006, the study showed -- and Mr. Jaffe attracted an offer close to his asking price soon after he listed it. But the deal fell apart in escrow when the buyer couldn't qualify for the loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jaffe bought the place in April 2005 for $935,000 in a bidding war, and still hopes to find someone who will meet his asking price. But he doesn't expect to see lines forming at his door, especially since homes in his price range are affordable to fewer people and no longer have quite the cachet that they once did. "The market is changing," he says. "It's definitely a buyer's market now."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales fell 0.8% to a 6.22 million annual rate in December, capping a soft year in which the drop in demand was the sharpest in 24 years. Economists see signs of stability in the wobbly housing market, but the question is, have we reached the bottom of the slump yet? Read a handful of economists' reactions to Thursday's report. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--- </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales fell for the first time in three months but the median sales price edged up for the first time in five months. A big drop in the inventory of unsold homes may indicate that the least "motivated" sellers are withdrawing from the market. If so, "bid-ask" spreads, which though unobservable are nonetheless a gauge of imbalance in market, could begin to narrow. However, further declines in prices may yet be necessary. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Nomura Economics Research </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--- </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent stability in sales helped bloated inventories show some improvement. Warm weather has likely supported recent housing market activity, and we expect some renewed downside now that more normal weather has arrived. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- David Greenlaw, Ted Wieseman, Morgan Stanley Research </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--- </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite December's decline, the trend in home sales is probably turning up. The most important evidence to this effect is that mortgage-purchase applications continue to rise: up 4.7% in December and 3.2% so far in January. -- J.P. Morgan Economic Research </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--- </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Households are still not out there buying homes like crazy, but at least demand is no longer collapsing. Existing home sales fell moderately in December and sales for all of last year were off sharply. The condo market cratered and single-family homes were not very strong either. All regions were off but the West was the weakest as sales dropped nearly 17% last year. In December, there was again a large fall off in the West, a more moderate one in the Northeast and increases in the South and Midwest. On the positive side, the adjustment process appears to be well under way. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Joel Naroff, Naroff Economic Advisors </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--- </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What are we to make of this report? No doubt many will leap on the dip in the inventory-sales ratios, the rise in condo sales and a leveling off in the annual rate of inflation as further evidence that the housing market is stabilizing. We remain more skeptical and, while acknowledging the marginally better tone of housing market indicators in November and December, still regard the housing market downturn as closer to the beginning than the end. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- BNP Paribas </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--- </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is showing some preliminary signs of stabilization, but there are not enough signs yet to suggest that we have convincingly turned the corner. The adjustment path is likely to be bumpy for several more months. The upshot is that housing and related upstream industries will continue to exert a significant drag on overall growth in the economy continue through the first half of 2007. </p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty and Ruth Simon </div><div>2134 words</div><div>25 January 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid a continuing glut of homes for sale in most of the country, buyers should have plenty of choices and lots of bargaining power in the spring selling season -- typically the busiest time of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many builders and real-estate brokers, for their part, hope the housing market will start recovering this year as buyers respond to price cuts and other sweeteners offered by increasingly nervous sellers. In some markets, agents say, buyer traffic has picked up in the last month or two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But any recovery is likely to be gradual. Donald Tomnitz, chief executive officer of D.R. Horton Inc., a home builder, told investors this week that the market, which began slumping in 2005, may bottom out by mid-2007, but that "we don't see any rapid improvement thereafter."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given all that, sellers should expect buyers to take their time and be tougher negotiators. David Lee, who recently moved to Wenham, Mass., to take up a post as an associate professor of physics at Gordon College, has rented a home for his family and says they plan to be "quite picky and choosy" as they look for a home to buy. Dr. Lee doesn't feel any pressure to decide quickly because he figures prices won't rise in the near term and could fall further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A quarterly survey of housing conditions in 28 major metropolitan areas by The Wall Street Journal showed that the inventory of unsold homes at the end of 2006 was up substantially in nearly all of the markets from the already plentiful level of a year earlier. The biggest increases were in the metro areas of Miami-Fort Lauderdale, Orlando, Tampa and Jacksonville, Fla.; Phoenix; and Portland, Ore. (Unlike the other cities, Portland had a lean supply of homes a year before.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey also includes recent pricing trends -- nearly all negative -- based on surveys of real-estate agents by Banc of America Securities in New York, a unit of Bank of America Corp., as well as data on late mortgage payments and job-creation prospects from Moody's Economy.com, a research firm in West Chester, Pa. Employment figures have a huge effect on housing demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price trends vary greatly from one region to another and even within metro areas. For instance, housing demand remains weak in the Detroit area, sapped by auto-related job losses, while the chic urban zones of San Francisco and Manhattan -- where space for new construction is extremely limited -- generally have stayed firm, though price appreciation is far slower than a year or two ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news for home sellers is that unemployment remains low in most areas, wages are growing and energy prices have fallen from their recent peaks. What's more, mortgage interest rates are still low, allowing people with good credit records to obtain 30-year fixed-rate loans at around 6.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many lenders are growing more cautious about how much debt home buyers should be allowed to take on and more inclined to ask for proof of income. This tougher attitude will exclude some marginal buyers from the market, hurting demand, even as a rising number of foreclosures throws more supply on the market. DataQuick Information Systems, a research firm in La Jolla, Calif., said yesterday that mortgage lenders sent 37,273 default notices to California homeowners in the fourth quarter, up 145% from a year earlier and the highest in more than eight years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, home builders still have lots of unsold homes that they will unload by further cutting prices and dangling such incentives as help with closing costs or kitchen upgrades. Discounts on new houses, in turn, will make it harder for some sellers of previously occupied homes to attract buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the biggest gluts of new homes are in Florida, Phoenix and the outer suburbs of Washington, D.C., says Ivy Zelman, a Cleveland-based housing analyst for Credit Suisse Group. Many of the gluts are due to frantic building of condominiums over the past few years. The supply of condos listed by real-estate agents is up 86% from a year earlier in the Las Vegas metro area, 43% in Washington, D.C., and 21% in the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington. In Florida's Miami-Dade and Broward counties, the listed condo supply has more than doubled from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Miami-Dade, the number of existing condos on the market is enough to last 27 months at the current sales rate, says Jack McCabe, a real-estate consultant in Deerfield Beach, Fla. The oversupply will grow, he says, as about 8,000 condos are expected to be completed this year and 12,000 in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's going to get bloody down here," Mr. McCabe says. He estimates that condo prices in Miami-Dade fell between 8% and 10% last year and will drop 20% in 2007. Eventually, he predicts, hedge funds and other investors will step in to buy surplus condos in bulk at huge discounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In California's San Diego County, developers have more than 10,000 condos available for sale in new buildings, projects under construction or properties being converted from rentals, says Peter Dennehy, a senior vice president at Sullivan Group Real Estate Advisors, a consulting firm based there. He says that supply is enough to last more than 20 months at the current sales rate. That number excludes several thousand condos being offered for resale by speculators and others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dennehy estimates that condo prices have fallen at least 15% to 20% in the county over the past year, though it's hard to measure price changes because sellers often give incentives such as free upgrades or help with closing costs that aren't reflected in the price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Boston area, lower-priced homes in blue-chip neighborhoods are moving pretty quickly. But ones that are overpriced or located on main streets are languishing, says Sam Schneiderman, broker-owner of Greater Boston Home Team. "It's got to be a really good deal," he says. "An OK deal doesn't quite cut it. Buyers are holding out."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The glut in inventories is likely to increase in some markets as sellers try to take advantage of what they hope will be a stronger selling season. Some sellers pulled their homes off the market late last year, intending to relist them in the spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage office in Scottsdale, Ariz., near Phoenix, listings are up roughly 30% since the end of December. The office expects listings to increase further in late February and early March as sellers who pulled their homes off the market before the holidays relist them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of last year's strongest housing markets now are showing signs of cooling a bit. In the San Francisco Bay area, the median price paid for new and resale homes in December was $612,000, up just 0.5% from a year earlier, according to DataQuick. But prices fell in parts of the Bay Area; they were down 6.3% from a year earlier in Sonoma County and down 5.1% in Solano County, DataQuick says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of California's weakest markets last year was the Sacramento area. Anthony Graham, an analyst at Trendgraphix Inc., a provider of housing data, says sellers of previously occupied homes there have had trouble competing with the huge discounts and incentives offered by builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Graham expects average home prices in the Sacramento metro area to fall between 6% and 8% this year, but believes the market will begin to recover modestly by the fourth quarter, assuming that home builders continue to cut their production. Greg Paquin, president of Gregory Group in Folsom, Calif., which gathers data on new home construction throughout the state, also thinks Sacramento is stabilizing after last year's price cuts. "Buyers who were on the fence are starting to say, 'Hey, this is a pretty good deal,'" Mr. Paquin says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California's Central Valley, which includes such cities as Bakersfield, Fresno, Merced and Stockton, may take longer to absorb excess new-home inventory and bring prices down to more affordable levels, Mr. Paquin said. He said that area may not bounce back until next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Manhattan, big bonuses recently doled out by Wall Street firms will help support the market in this year's first half, says Jonathan Miller, chief executive officer of Miller Samuel Real Estate Appraisers in New York. But a rash of new condo developments will help moderate prices. He expects price increases this year to average 5% to 6% in Manhattan. On Long Island, he believes prices are likely to be flat to slightly higher this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New Jersey, "I'm optimistic that home sales will begin to rebound in the spring," says Jeffrey Otteau, president of Otteau Valuation Group Inc., an appraisal and research firm in East Brunswick, N.J. "However, that would signal the end of the decline -- not a return to higher prices."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Otteau figures home prices fell an average of about 10% in New Jersey last year. For 2007, he believes homes costing less than about $600,000 are likely to rise modestly, around 3%, while homes above that level are about flat. In the luxury end of the market, prices may edge down again this year, Mr. Otteau says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Chicago area, some homes that have sat on the market are finally moving, says Barbara O'Connor, an agent with Baird &amp;Warner. But some sellers have had to accept far less than they had hoped for. Jody Andre, a restaurateur, put her three-story Victorian-style home in the Edgewater neighborhood on the market in August at $679,000. She later lowered the price to $634,900 but still got no offers. "This is a hot neighborhood and a lot of people couldn't understand why the house didn't sell," says Ms. Andre, who accepted a $605,000 offer last week. "I waited too long to put it on the market," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The end of the year is normally a slow time, but in some parts of the country traffic has increased in the last month or two, helped by unseasonably warm weather. In Philadelphia's Center City, buyer traffic began to pick up in November and has continued to climb over the last two months, says Mike McCann, an associate broker with Prudential Fox &amp;Roach, Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent open house for a three-bedroom home priced at $469,000 drew 17 parties, Mr. McCann reports. In the summer and early fall, he says, "we didn't want to do open houses because it was a wasted day." Sales are also increasing, but negotiations are taking longer and many offers are contingent on the buyers selling their current homes, Mr. McCann adds. Prudential Fox &amp;Roach is also seeing more people asking to get pre-approved for a mortgage, a sign that they may be ready to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Atlanta, where the housing market began to soften in August, business started picking up again in December, says Lewis Glenn, president and chief executive of Harry Norman, Realtors. "There's more negotiation," and builders are cutting prices and offering concessions, such as buying down the borrower's mortgage rate, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Scottsdale, some sellers are cutting prices by 10% or more, says Dale Pavlicek, sales manager for the Coldwell Banker Residential office there. "There are a lot of vacant homes on the market," he says. Sellers who bought in the past year or two are barely breaking even or are coming to the closing table with money to pay off their mortgage and other costs, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houston remains one of the nation's more buoyant housing markets, supported by job growth in the energy industry. Rob Cook, chairman of the Houston Association of Realtors, says the supply of homes on the market is enough to last about six months at the current sales rate -- what he calls a "balanced" market. Prices are rising only modestly, though, because Texas has plenty of room for new construction. "We just keep expanding out farther and farther," Mr. Cook says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer prices in the U.S. resurged a bit and builders broke ground on more new homes in December, but the activity did little to change economists' views that inflation is cooling and the housing slump has yet to hit bottom.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bump up in energy prices caused consumer prices to rise 0.5% in December from a month earlier after remaining flat or falling in the three previous months, the U.S. Labor Department said Thursday. Core prices excluding food and energy -- a measure policy makers at the Federal Reserve watch more closely -- rose 0.2%, in line with economists' expectations, as apparel retailers ratcheted back holiday discounts. Compared with a year earlier, overall prices rose 2.5% and core prices were up 2.6%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, unusually warm weather prompted new-home construction to rise for the second-consecutive month, the Commerce Department reported. At a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.64 million in December, housing starts rose 4.5% from November but still fell 18% for the year. All of the gain came in multi-unit structures. Construction of new single-family homes, which account for about three-fourths of total activity, actually fell 4.1% in December from the previous month despite the warm weather. Single-family housing starts fell 25% from a year earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists saw the reports as well within the game plan of Fed policy makers, who expect persistent weakness in housing to help cool the economy, gradually bringing core inflation back down to a more acceptable annual level of 1% to 2%. "Things are playing out pretty much along the lines the Fed expected," said Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist at consultancy MFR Inc. "Inflation pressures are gradually easing, and housing is still weak."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While many economists say the worst of the housing bust has passed, builders still have a large backlog of unsold homes, suggesting they likely will have to pull back further to get supply in line with demand.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the inflation front, some concerns remain. For one, workers' wages have started rising after a long period of relative dormancy: As of December, the average hourly production wage stood at $17.04, up 4.2% from a year earlier. Another concern is that the recent string of subdued inflation numbers could be the temporary result of unusually heavy holiday discounting.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer prices resurged a bit and builders broke ground on more new homes in December, but the activity did little to change economists' view that inflation is cooling and that the housing slump has yet to hit bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bump up in energy prices caused consumer prices to rise 0.5% in December from a month earlier after remaining flat or falling in the three previous months, the Labor Department reported yesterday. Excluding food and energy, so-called core prices -- a measure officials at the Federal Reserve watch closely -- rose 0.2%, in line with economists' expectations, as apparel retailers ratcheted back holiday discounts. Compared with a year earlier, overall prices rose 2.5% and core prices were up 2.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, unusually warm weather prompted new-home construction to rise for the second consecutive month, the Commerce Department reported. At a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.64 million in December, housing starts were up 4.5% from November, but still down 18% for the year. All of the gain came in multi-unit structures such as apartment buildings. Construction of new single-family homes, which account for about three-fourths of total activity, fell 4.1% in December from the previous month despite the warm weather. Single-family housing starts were down 25% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists saw the reports as well within the game plan of Fed policy makers, who expect persistent weakness in housing to help cool the economy, gradually bringing core inflation back down to a more acceptable annual level of 1% to 2%. In the fourth quarter, core prices rose at an annualized rate of 1.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Things are playing out pretty much along the lines the Fed expected," said Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist at consultancy MFR, Inc. "Inflation pressures are gradually easing and housing is still weak."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While many economists believe the worst of the housing slump has passed, declines in home construction could still have a way to go. Major housing slumps over the past several decades have seen home construction drop by an average of about 60% over at least two years. As of December, total new-home construction was down 28% from its most recent peak, which came in January 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders face a large backlog of unsold homes, suggesting they will likely have to pull back further to get supply in line with demand. Earlier this week, home builders Lennar Corp. and Centex Corp. offered downbeat outlooks, with the latter saying it was facing the toughest market in 25 years. The National Association of Home Builders index of sentiment has shown some improvement in recent months, though it remains well below 50, meaning negative responses outweigh positive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the inflation front, concerns remain. For one, workers' wages have started rising after a long period of relative dormancy: As of December, the average hourly production wage stood at $17.04, up 4.2% from a year earlier. When people make more money, they tend to push prices of goods and services up, though so far that hasn't been evident in the consumer-price data, said Andrew Tilton, U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The dog that hasn't barked is really wage inflation," he said. "That's the biggest risk over the next six months or so."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another concern is that the recent string of subdued inflation numbers could be the temporary result of unusually heavy holiday discounting. In recent months, big retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Best Buy Co. have slashed prices of electronics items such as flat-panel televisions in an effort to spur sales. That trend appeared to continue in December, as audio and video prices fell 0.7% from a month earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In apparel, though, retailers appeared to be regaining the power to raise prices. Apparel prices rose 0.3% in December after falling in previous months, a move that Brian Bethune, U.S. economist at Global Insight, attributed to strong demand at high-end retailers. "The upscale channels seem to be doing very well," he said. "That may have put more pressure on apparel prices toward the end of the year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond the goods sector, inflation in services has yet to show much sign of abating. Rent of shelter, a category that makes up about 40% of the core price index, rose 0.4% in December from November, and has risen at a 4.4% annualized rate over the last six months. Still, some relief could be on the way. Richard Campo, chief executive of Houston-based Camden Property Trust, which owns some 70,000 apartments across the country, says he expects rents to keep rising in 2007, but at a slower rate than in 2006. </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">The Home Front: The Year of Listing Patiently --- Sales Are Slow for Pricey Homes In 'House of the Week' Review; 12% Cut on a Philip Johnson</span>
</div><div class="author">By Ben Casselman </div><div>1833 words</div><div>19 January 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>W10</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LAST YEAR PROVED to be a tough one to sell a house. In many parts of the country, sales were down, inventories were up and homes lingered longer on the market. In August, the median price of an existing single-family home fell 1.7% compared with a year earlier, the first year-to-year price decline in more than a decade, and prices continued to fall for the remainder of 2006, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The high end of the market wasn't immune, either, as evidenced by the lackluster sales of the homes highlighted in Weekend Journal's "House of the Week." Of the 46 houses featured from October 2005 and September 2006, only 14 have sold, most at steep discounts -- an average of 16% below the asking price published in our column; another four are in contract. Timing was also critical: Only one house featured since June has found a buyer. (None of those featured in the fourth quarter of 2006 have sold, but they aren't included in this survey because most have only recently come on the market.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes featured in House of the Week aren't representative of the national housing market. For one thing, they tend to be high-end properties: the average asking price for the homes in our sample was nearly $10 million, while only one asked less than $1 million. They are also selected for other qualities -- noteworthy architecture, colorful histories or singular locations -- that set them apart even from other luxury homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, their sales performance has generally followed national patterns. Overall sales volume peaked in mid 2005 and then declined steadily throughout most of 2006, according to the National Association of Realtors, and existing home sales in November 2006 were down 11% compared with the previous year. The same held true for the Houses of the Week. Of the 23 properties featured between October 2005 through March 2006 -- when the overall market was relatively strong -- 12 have sold or are in contract, compared with just six of those featured during the following six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The properties that were most likely to find a buyer were those with the highest price tags. Half of the Houses of the Week with asking prices of $15 million or more have sold, versus just over a quarter of those asking less than $15 million. That, too, follows a national trend, according to Jonathan Miller, president of the New York appraisal firm Miller Samuel. "Super luxury" homes have continued to sell in high numbers, he says, though not necessarily close to their asking prices. In fact, one reason they tend to sell, Mr. Miller says, is because their owners can be more flexible; these deals don't live or die over a $5 million difference. And unlike the general housing market, which is strongly affected by interest-rate fluctuations, upscale home sales tend to be more sensitive to the stock market and the overall economy because buyers are more likely to pay in cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Lee, the owner of a 10,000-square-foot waterfront mansion in Palm Beach, where the market remains healthy, actually raised her asking price recently, to $22 million from $18.5 million. That builds in room to negotiate, says listing agent Wallace Turner of Sotheby's International Realty. At the same time, "the buyers feel that they're getting a value, even though we're settling it at about the same price in the end," Mr. Turner says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most sellers, however, moved in the opposite direction. About half of the House of the Week properties still on the market have had a price cut since they appeared in the column, in one case by 35%. Others have been taken off the market entirely, although many sellers say they will try again when the market improves. It may be a while, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's Economy.com. "There's still a lot of oversupply," even at the high end, he says. "I think the correction really has a year left to run."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's a sampling of four Houses of the Week in different parts of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLD: Southern California oceanfront contemporary, for $27 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This 3,544-square-foot home in Carpinteria, about 12 miles south of Santa Barbara, sold for 77% of its $35 million asking price, but Charlene and Sherrill Broudy say that's still far more than they expected before they put it on the market in the spring. The asking price was "a shot in the dark," Ms. Broudy says. The value in the 1.7-acre property lay primarily in its seaside location -- with 150 feet of beachfront -- rather than the house itself -- a four-bedroom home built in 1980 (which Ms. Broudy says needed work). Listing agent Kathleen St. James of Sotheby's International Realty moved into the house while the owners were away in Costa Rica and cleaned it up, a project that included pressure-washing and oiling its redwood exterior. The May 5 "House of the Week" sold in 60 days. The buyer, local venture capitalist Brian Kelly, saw the property in its first week on the market, before Ms. St. James's cleaning job, and submitted the only serious bid. "You don't have that many people calling you up to spend that kind of money," Ms. St. James says. "Sometimes you get lucky."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AVAILABLE: 319-acre Montana ranch on the Yellowstone River. Asking $13.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dan and Barbara Todd recently cut 10% off the $15 million price of their ranch in Livingston, about 26 miles southeast of Bozeman, after it had been listed for about a year. Mr. Todd says the price cut was a response to a softening market -- Montana ranch sales volume is down from last year, though prices have continued to rise -- and to signal that he is ready to make a deal. The property includes a recently built six-bedroom, 6,400-square-foot main house, a guest cottage and a one-bedroom barn/artist studio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the eighth ranch that the Todds have bought and sold, but the first that is primarily recreational, not agricultural. "When I show the property, I don't know whether someone wants to shoot a deer or look at it," Mr. Todd says. He isn't concerned that the house, which was featured on March 17, has yet to attract a buyer. Listing agent David Johnson of Hall &amp;Hall says ranches usually stay on the market at least a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOLD: Connecticut midcentury modern with pedigree, for $3.75 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This Philip Johnson-designed house in New Canaan went into contract within four months of being listed, albeit at a 12% reduction, from $4.25 million. The sale closed in just six months. Meanwhile, sales volume in Fairfield County, Conn., was down nearly 15% in the first three quarters of 2006 compared with the same period in 2005. Listing agent Susan E. Blabey of William Pitt Sotheby's International Realty attributes the modern home's speedy sale to its being "100% pure Philip Johnson," practically unchanged since the award-winning architect designed it in 1950. Not that there weren't challenges to overcome, including strict preservation easements that protected the land, the house and even some of the interior features. The "House of the Week" for June 9, had also been vacant two years and needed work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Craig Bassam and Scott Fellows knew what they were getting into. The buyers run the design firm BassamFellows and also own another vintage modern in New Canaan, which they're selling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AVAILABLE: Low Country home on a South Carolina island. Asking $1.95 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This four-bedroom, nearly 5,000-square-foot home on Daufuskie Island, a second-home area about a mile from Hilton Head Island, came on the market in July 2005, just missing the area's primary selling season. Interest picked up the following spring, says listing agent Catherine Donaldson of Cora Bett Thomas Realty, but then the market hit a severe slump in the summer. (The home was featured on June 16, 2006.) The owners -- Detroit Red Wings center Robert Lang and his wife, Jennifer -- cut the price in August, but by then it was too late, Donaldson says. She adds that the 21% cut has generated interest, but mostly low-ball offers. "When you drop a price that much, you give the impression that it's a fire sale, and it's not." It doesn't help that Daufuskie Island is accessible only by water. "It is tough to sell a home on an island you can only get to by boat," she says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bernanke to Address</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cost of Aging Boomers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke testifies before the Senate Budget Committee, where he will discuss the financial challenges posed by retiring baby boomers and the ballooning costs of Social Security and Medicare programs. During the question-and-answer session, he could face grilling over whether the Bush tax cuts should be extended and issues surrounding entitlement reform, such as retirement age. The testimony is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. EST.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer Inflation</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">May Show an Uptick</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consumer-price index, tame for several months, could edge up slightly. Forecasts see the overall CPI rising 0.4% or 0.5% for December, compared with November's flat showing. The core CPI, stripping out food and fuel, is projected to inch up 0.1%, after gaining 0.2% in November. The core rate of consumer inflation reached a decade high of 2.9% year-over-year in September but has since eased off. The Bureau of Labor Statistics releases the CPI at 8:30 a.m. EST.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-Building Arrow</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. housing starts likely slowed in December, with predictions of the annualized rate slipping to a range of between 1.56 million and 1.58 million units from a 1.59 million rate in November. Some builders say they have seen increased interest from buyers lately, but they have also been offering additional incentives to work down their new-home inventories. The Commerce Department releases housing starts and building permits at 8:30 a.m. EST.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home sales will decline less sharply this year than they did last year, while home-price appreciation is expected to gain steam, the National Association of Realtors said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its latest forecast, the NAR said sales of existing homes are likely to decline about 1.2% this year to 6.42 million, following a sharp drop last year, while sales of new homes are seen falling about 9.7% to 957,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the market is starting this year at a relatively low point, even a gradual recovery of sales during the year would mean that annual totals for 2007 are likely to show no substantial improvement, according to NAR Chief Economist David Lereah.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The good news is that the steady improvement in sales will support price appreciation moving forward," Mr. Lereah says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors' group, which is running a $40 million ad campaign designed to encourage consumers to contact their local realtors, expects moderate price increases this year. The group forecasts the median sales price for existing homes to grow 1.5% nationally to $225,300, following last year's estimated 1.1% rise. The national median price for new homes will increase 3% this year to $248,900, according to the NAR, after estimated growth of 0.3% last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As builders rein in new projects to support prices, housing starts are expected to drop 16.6% this year to 1.51 million, their lowest level in a decade, the NAR said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage Bankers Association chief economist Doug Duncan expects home prices to rise 1% to 2% annually for the next couple of years. But some markets could see price declines of 10% to 20% this year, he says, a shift from the last four to five years, when there were "almost no markets where prices were declining."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales will decline 7% to 8% this year, with most of the decline in the first half, adds Mr. Duncan, who expects the market to bottom out in mid- to late 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the volume of mortgage applications filed with major U.S. banks rose 16.6% on a seasonally adjusted basis last week, compared with the week before, the MBA reported yesterday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of applications -- for both purchases and refinancings -- increased 12%, compared with the same period a year earlier. Application volumes, on a seasonally adjusted basis, fell about 14% just before the holidays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Applications for loans to buy homes stood at the highest level in nearly a year, according to the MBA. Applications to refinance rose about 28% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate loan fell to 6.13% from 6.22% the previous week, which was the highest rate seen in eight weeks. The average rate for a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped to 5.85% from 5.93% the previous week. The rate for a one-year adjustable-rate mortgage, or ARM, averaged 5.79%, down from 5.84% the previous week, the MBA's data showed.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[What's Brewing in the Real-Estate Market]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European Echo</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Europe's property boom isn't over, but there are early signs it could soon follow the slowdown in U.S. home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While home prices are generally still rising, the pace of those gains slowed, often sharply, in nearly a dozen Western European countries during the third quarter of last year, according to a survey by Knight Frank, the international property agent. The shift occurred as a series of interest-rate increases have started to bite and affordability has deteriorated markedly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In France, home prices rose an annualized 8.9% in the third quarter, compared with a 15.5% rate a year earlier. Apartment prices in France's fashionable southeast, which includes the Mediterranean coastline, rose slightly less than 3% from a year earlier in the July-September quarter after surging almost 19% in the same period of 2005, estimates FNAIM, France's national association of real-estate agencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">French home buyers feel that they can now take their time, with a greater choice of properties on the market, said Nick Dowlatshahi, managing director of Leapfrog Properties, a property consultant based in the United Kingdom that works closely with about 1,500 French agents and developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One exception remained the U.K., where annual house inflation accelerated to 9.3% in the fourth quarter of 2006 from 4.8% in the second quarter, buoyed in part by a shortage of supply in the London area, mortgage lender Nationwide Building Society said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Designing Profits</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Profit margins at architecture firms are up over the past three years to a robust 14%, according to a study by the American Institute of Architects. The triennial survey among its 80,000 members found the 2005 profit margin (before taxes, discretionary bonuses and profit sharing) was up three percentage points since 2002, when architects kept around 11% of revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The news comes as architects are busier than ever supervising a commercial real-estate building boom among hospitals, schools, hotels and offices. The survey, which reflects 2005 firm revenue, took place before residential construction began its downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey found good news for female architects in particular. Women now make up more than a quarter (26%) of licensed architects, up from 20% in 1999. The percentage who are firm principals has quadrupled from 4% in 1999 to 16% in 2005. The share of minority architects overall has risen from 9% to 16% over the same time period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wide Open Spaces</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Avex Group , a Dallas-based land investor and developer, has purchased a 5,700-acre parcel of land more than 30 miles northwest of downtown Houston, which it intends to turn into master-planned community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People want to live where they can have a piece of land in a less dense environment," says John Knapp, Avex Group president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cities such as Houston, where land is abundant and relatively inexpensive, offer such promise. The parcel, known as Woodard Ranch, was sold by businessman Larry Woodward in late December for more than $50 million and is among the largest pieces of property in the U.S. to be sold near a major metropolitan area in recent years, says Mr. Knapp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But John Mcllwain, senior resident fellow at the Urban Land Institute, says the push to develop runs counter to another trend: a return to the city. Houston, for example, has spent billions of dollars to transform its downtown into a 24-hour hub, with spotty results.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Michael Corkery and James R. Hagerty </div><div>1922 words</div><div>8 January 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAPLES, Fla. -- In 2005, this once-sleepy retirement haven on Florida's west coast was arguably the hottest housing market in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders held lotteries to determine who could purchase homes in new gated communities. In the older neighborhoods, buyers were snapping up modest ranch houses and cottages soon after they were listed for sale. The median home price more than doubled between 2000 and 2005, to about $482,400.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The frenzied run-up prompted economists at banking concern National City Corp. and the economic consulting firm Global Insight Inc. to label Naples "the most overvalued" housing market in the U.S. in the second quarter of 2005, a dubious honor it retains. Today, prices are dropping, the number of unsold homes on the market has swelled to more than twice the national average and investors are scrambling to unload their properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such a crescendo of activity might have prompted some to pull back. But plenty of investors, who purchased homes to rent or flip, continued to buy and sell through the height of the boom. One of them was Marjorie Dresner. The Canadian native believed that Naples, with its laid-back, balmy atmosphere, would long be an attractive market. A prolific investor, she purchased dozens of houses in recent years, many of them with a partner. One of them cost her $1.7 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The early run-up in real-estate prices in Naples was based on strong economic fundamentals. Low interest rates, the creation of new mortgage products and a strong economy triggered a wave of home buying by making ownership affordable for the masses. And Naples was especially desirable, with its chic restaurants, impeccably landscaped streets, stretches of pristine beaches and influx of baby boomers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it's increasingly evident that investors and speculators here and elsewhere played a greater role than previously thought in pumping up the real-estate bubble -- especially near the end of the run.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late October, Ms. Dresner tried auctioning off 28 of her properties, but some bids were as much as 40% lower than what she paid. One three-bedroom ranch house she purchased in July 2005 in the middle-class Lake Park neighborhood fetched a high bid of $400,000; Ms. Dresner and a partner paid $690,000 for the house, according to county records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Dresner won't talk much about her investment experience, but prefers to focus on the positive. "I did very well in the beginning," she says. "I look at the overall picture. You don't just look at one year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists cite individual investors for pushing prices up excessively and lenders for lowering their credit standards. Borrowers were able to purchase homes with little or no money down and often without having to verify their income and financial assets. In many areas, builders made things worse by putting up too many houses for the market to absorb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you look at the last two contractions you can see what caused it: high mortgage rates and a slumping economy," says David Lereah, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors. "Today we don't have that. The economy is still good. The thing that sent us into a contraction was that house prices were getting high and affordability was aggravated by investor speculation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists and housing industry executives had previously estimated that as few as 10% of the buyers in hot markets were investors. A survey by the National Association of Realtors found that 28% of buyers in 2005 were investors. At the peak of the Naples market in 2004 and 2005, as many as 50% of buyers may have been investors, local real-estate agents say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Naples boom and bust also illustrates how some savvy investors can help rebalance markets, by coming back in and picking up the pieces left by previous investors. Indeed, some of the buyers who placed bids on Ms. Dresner's houses at the auction in October were other investors. One of them was Jerry Krecicki Jr. "It's all about timing," says Mr. Krecicki, a local real-estate investor and real-estate agent who believes the market will rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Krecicki, a former car salesman with salt-and-pepper hair, decided to enter the fray and got his license to sell real estate in September 2001. His brokerage, Remax Elite Realty, encouraged him to focus on selling homes in the areas he knew best. So Mr. Krecicki chose the Lake Park neighborhood, where he lives, near the heart of quaint downtown Naples and just across a highway from the ritzier neighborhoods closer to the beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Krecicki, 43, also decided to buy investment homes to build a retirement nest egg. His strategy was to rent out some homes and sell others to use the profits to buy more properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October 2002, Mr. Krecicki and a partner bought their first investment property -- a three-bedroom, one-story house on 10th Avenue in Lake Park. They paid $200,000, using a mortgage loan secured by the equity in their primary residences, and spent $30,000 on renovations in hopes of selling it for a profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Krecicki says his first full year as a real-estate agent was relatively slow as he built his reputation around the neighborhood. But by early 2003, business had picked up. That year, home prices across Naples rose 13%, and the city was gaining a reputation across the country -- mostly through word of mouth -- as a hot market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its waterfront was crowding with massive mansions. Baby boomers were buying second homes. Young people were moving to Naples to work as money managers, lawyers and real-estate agents. The international airport in nearby Fort Myers made it easy to reach. Investors smelled opportunity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People wanted a piece of Naples so badly, they were willing to buy whatever came on the market," says Michael Tomany, a real-estate agent, who owns 13 properties in Naples.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 2004, investors were scouring every corner of Naples, including Lake Park. Although many of the homes were small and drab, they were built on spacious lots facing quiet streets adorned with palm trees and shrubbery. That caught the attention of home buyers willing to tear down the old homes and rebuild new, bigger homes or undertake substantial renovations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Dresner also saw the potential in Lake Park. The Toronto native had been buying investment properties in and around Naples since 1999, Collier County records show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of her strategy was to renovate the older houses or team up with builders to tear down and construct new homes. "Our objective was to renovate and transform neighborhoods," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Krecicki says he met Ms. Dresner a few months after he sold her his home on 10th Avenue in Lake Park in September 2004 for $435,000, more than double what he paid for it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After that deal, Mr. Krecicki served as her real-estate agent on multiple sales in Lake Park. Soon after homes went on the market, "Marjorie was on the top of my list" to call, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Dresner bought several homes in and around Lake Park in 2004 and 2005, records show. She also bought houses in the pricier section of Naples, known as the Moorings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Krecicki's business as a sales agent was booming. He says he closed $15 million in sales in 2005 up from $5 million in 2003. He also got more interested in properties for investment. He says he bought two more homes in Lake Park, including a duplex for $349,000, in April 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seven months after he bought the duplex, in October 2005, Mr. Krecicki sold it to Ms. Dresner and a partner for $621,000, county records show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, longtime Lake Park residents were emboldened by the escalating prices, which had skyrocketed 28% in 2004 and 30% in 2005 across Naples. They tried to cash in. "A lot of people had false hopes for what they could get for their properties so everybody put their houses on the market with unrealistic expectations," says John Turner, a real-estate agent who also lives and sells homes in Lake Park. "They see a sale for $700,000, and they say, 'Wow, I can get that too.'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dona Steele, an artist, lives next to a three-bedroom ranch house that Ms. Dresner bought for $690,000 in July 2005. The house, which sits on a lake, sold for $275,000 in February 2001. "We were just laughing at these prices," Ms. Steele says. "I grew up here and it's out of control. This used to be a working-class neighborhood."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Dresner says she never bought a home for more than its appraised value. "The sellers can ask whatever, but it's up to the banks in how they appraise it," she says. "I never overpaid for anything."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several factors converged in late 2005 and early 2006 that turned Naples investors into mass home sellers. The active hurricane season caused a spike in insurance rates throughout Florida. Coupled with a rise in short-term interest rates and property taxes, investors now were facing higher carrying costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Dresner says she was growing tired of the burdens of being a landlord. Many of her properties were listed for sale in early 2006, but some were slow to move. In late October, she tried a new tactic and auctioned off the houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Krecicki says he went to the auction out of curiosity and jumped into the bidding when he saw the low prices. "After about two hours, a house came up for bid that I knew very well," Mr. Krecicki recounted in a monthly newsletter he distributes, called the Lake Park Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I looked at my friend next to me with a bidding card and check in his hand and asked him, 'Aren't you going to bid on this one? C'mon, man, 50/50 split. Bid on this one.'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They put up the highest bid, which was $275,000. It was the same house Mr. Krecicki and a partner sold to Ms. Dresner for $435,000. Given the huge price drop, "it would have been stupidity" not to bid, Mr. Krecicki says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the sales from the auction haven't closed yet. In many cases the top bids on Ms. Dresner's homes weren't high enough to pay off her lenders in full, says auctioneer Paul Drake. Ms. Dresner's lawyer says she has received additional offers on several houses since the auction, but that no sales have closed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past month, both Countrywide Home Loans Inc. and the Bank of New York filed court papers in Collier County Circuit Court in Florida saying they are seeking to force a foreclosure sale on two properties owned by Ms. Dresner.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Krecicki and a partner still own about a dozen homes that they are renting out.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will Housing</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally Bloom</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Spring?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors might discover in the weeks ahead that calling a bottom in the housing downturn is a mug's game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until last week, it had been looking to some like a bottom might be at hand. Then Tuesday, Lennar Corp. said it expected to show a large loss on the back of land write-downs of $400 million to $500 million. The home builder said it has yet to see "tangible evidence of a market recovery." Thursday, the National Association of Realtors said its index of pending home sales, which is based on how many sales contracts have been signed in a given month, slipped in November. The Dow Jones index of home-building shares fell 4.3% last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a slow time of year for the housing market. Little wiggles in actual activity can look bigger after statisticians make their seasonal adjustments. A warm January can distort the view even more. Home builders say they won't know for sure if the downturn is over until the spring, when seasonal activity picks up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here is one reason to be careful about calling a bottom now. A large number of homes for sale are unoccupied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the third quarter, there were 5.7 million vacant housing units for sale or rent, accounting for a record 4.6% of all U.S. homes. The average in the 1990s was about 3.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To get this ratio back to normal, 1.3 million vacant homes would need to be occupied. For comparison sake, economists polled by Blue Chip Economic Indicators expect construction to begin on about 1.6 million homes this year. With so many empty homes out there, one wonders why builders would bother breaking ground on new ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High vacancy rates have other effects, points out Credit Suisse analyst Ivy Zelman. When an occupied home gets sold, the seller has to buy or rent another house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That sets off a chain reaction that ripples through the housing market. When a vacant home gets sold, the seller doesn't have to do anything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The owners of those unrented, unsold homes bear costs. They have got insurance, the lawn guy, taxes and, often, a mortgage to pay. Seeing those costs pile up can motivate an owner to sell or rent at much lower prices. When a house sells at a lower price, other would-be buyers expect lower prices as well. When it rents for less, it becomes a more-attractive alternative to buying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news (yes, there is good news) is that trouble in housing hasn't spelled trouble for the rest of the economy. Friday's jobs report showed that. Even though there was a decline in the number of construction jobs in December, a big pickup in service-sector jobs more than offset the drop. Wages rose, too. Meanwhile, low interest rates give households more buying power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the longer the housing funk lasts, the more likely its impact will spread. Here is hoping that in the spring there will be growth. Until then, be careful.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Timothy Aeppel  </div><div>865 words</div><div>4 January 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. manufacturing is showing surprising resilience in the face of a sharp slump in autos and housing, and in the coming year is expected to expand roughly in line with the overall economy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A closely watched manufacturing index turned positive in December, reversing a decline the month before that had sparked gloom about the sector's outlook. New orders and production both edged up, while pricing pressures eased.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Norbert Ore, an economist at the Institute for Supply Management, which released the report yesterday, said some sectors are suffering -- including housing-related products from bricks and backhoes to rugs and refrigerators. "But there are also pockets of strength," he said, such as oil exploration and aerospace.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another report released yesterday suggests the U.S. job market may have shed workers in December. Private employment fell a seasonally adjusted 40,000 last month, according to the report by Automatic Data Processing, the payroll-processing company, and Macroeconomic Advisers, an economic-forecasting firm. The government releases its monthly job report tomorrow.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the U.S. Commerce Department said yesterday total construction spending fell 0.2% in November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.184 trillion. That report also presented a mixed picture, with residential construction down 1.6% from the previous month, the eighth consecutive monthly decline, while nonresidential construction of hotels and office buildings rose 1.2%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturing is coming off a prolonged boom that prompted producers to expand -- factory construction rose 20% last year -- and, in many cases, end up with bloated warehouses as economic growth cooled in recent months. While the U.S. economy expanded an estimated 3.3% last year, manufacturing output surged 4.8%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That will likely change. "What you're going to see, going forward, is a manufacturing sector that, instead of growing a lot faster than the overall economy, will be growing more in line with the economy," said David Huether, chief economist at the National Association of Manufacturers. Economists expect the U.S. economy to expand about 2.3% this year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, an Arlington, Virginia policy and research group, is forecasting a "pronounced slowing" in manufacturing growth this year. For instance, household-appliance production is expected to decline 5%, while output of heavy-duty trucks will fall 23%. Surging demand for cellular phones and digital televisions is set to push up semiconductor shipments 10% this year and shipments of airplane parts 9%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Machinery production has been one of the bright spots for manufacturing during the past two years and, overall, is expected to remain robust. But Daniel Meckstroth, one of the group's economists, noted that output of construction machinery is expected to slide 1% in 2007, as a result of the housing slump, while output of oil and gas machinery is expected to grow 11% and industrial machinery 8%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even within sectors, he said, "it's a mixed bag."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One nagging problem is inventories. As long as producers are stuck with excess goods, they will be focused on curbing output in line with demand. The latest ISM report showed customer inventories stood at 50.5% in December, the third straight month above 50%, which indicates that inventories are too high. Inventories of autos are particularly high, a situation that has prompted U.S. auto makers to announce production cuts in a bid to shrink backlogs of unsold cars.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Van Jolissaint, chief economist of auto maker DaimlerChrysler AG, said he thinks most of the big production cuts already have been made in his sector and that conditions should improve by the second half of the year, particularly if employment and income gains don't falter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the year progresses, he added, the housing sector should bottom out, too. "I'm actually pretty optimistic, not from the auto point of view, but from the point of view of the overall economy in 2007," Mr. Jolissaint said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, some sectors face an uncertain future. "We saw the contraction in housing hit us fairly rapidly this last fall," said Fletcher Steele, president of Pine Hall Brick Co. in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Sales at the closely held company plunged 30% in November from a year earlier and were down 20% in December, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pine Hall, which sells more than 80% of its bricks to homebuilders, has idled half of the eight kilns in its four factories in North Carolina and Georgia. The company normally builds inventories during the slow winter months, but this year Mr. Steele isn't sure how much inventory building he will do.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another uncertainty dogging manufacturers is the value of the dollar. Ronald DeFeo, chief executive of Terex Corp., a Westport, Connecticut, maker of mining and construction machinery, says he worries the dollar's value could continue to fall relative to other major countries. While the weaker dollar benefits his big factory in Redmond, Washington, which makes aerial platforms that are exported world-wide, it hurts his crane and other equipment operations in Europe.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. construction spending continued to decline in November amid a housing slump, but brisk building activity in other sectors, including a hotel building boom, helped to partially offset housing weakness.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total construction spending fell 0.2% from October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.184 trillion, the U.S. Commerce Department said. Residential construction fell 1.6% from October -- the eighth consecutive monthly decline -- and a sign that home builders are curtailing construction amid sluggish sales. Meanwhile, nonresidential construction -- a category that includes hotels, office space and highways -- rose 1.2%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction patterns are being watched closely by economists, many of whom expect the U.S. housing slump to curtail building activity in coming months, as home builders pare excess inventories. While the possibility of sharp residential construction declines have threatened the broader U.S. economy, many analysts say the contraction should help lay the groundwork for a housing rebound in the second half of the year. Moreover, building activity remains robust in other sectors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"2007 will bring several more months of pain for home builders, but we may see an upturn in residential construction by the end of the year," said Ken Simonson, chief economist at the Associated General Contractors of America, a trade group. Meanwhile, the surge in nonresidential construction "is extremely important," he said. "It's neutralizing the drag created by the drop in housing."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Simonson forecasts that total construction spending will be flat this year, as a projected 8% to 10% decline in residential construction is offset by a projected 8% to 10% rise in nonresidential construction, including hotels and hospitals.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Health-care construction, such as for hospitals, rose 1.2% in November from a month earlier and 20.6% from November 2005. Lodging construction, such as for hotels, rose 5.2% in November from a month earlier and 77% from a year earlier.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hospitality experts say new hotels are sprouting across the country for several reasons: New hotel construction was weak after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, as business travel slumped; hotel occupancy rates are rising; and hotel revenues are surging. Across the U.S., hotel revenues per room rose an average of nearly 8% last year, more than double the 30-year average of 3.1%, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. This year, the consulting firm projects hotel revenues per room will climb an average of nearly 6%.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent decline in commodity prices has been a double-edged sword for manufacturers. Less costly commodities, which translate into lower raw-materials costs, are a welcome break for factories after several years of hefty increases; yesterday, sharp declines in metals prices pummeled mining stocks, sending Freeport McMoRan Copper &amp;Gold Inc. plunging $5.24, or 9.4%, to $50.49 as of 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many manufacturers, however, built up supplies of metals and other commodities when prices were high, anticipating further price increases. Those companies now are stuck with pricey stockpiles and are unlikely to feel any immediate relief from lower raw-materials prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another uncertainty dogging manufacturers is the value of the dollar.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York City's residential market perhaps has started to crack. The average sales price of a Manhattan apartment fell 5.7% between the third quarter and the fourth quarter of 2006, the second consecutive quarter that prices have fallen, according to a new study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices slipped 2.2% between the second and third quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report, released by appraisal firm Mitchell, Maxwell &amp;Jackson Inc., showed the average price paid for a condominium or cooperative apartment in the fourth quarter fell to $1,079,363 from $1,144,024 in the third quarter and was down 4.4% from the same period a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average price of an apartment in full year 2006 was down 7.7% from the market's peak in the second quarter of 2006, the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Jeffrey Jackson, co-founder and chief economist at Mitchell, Maxwell &amp;Jackson, said it isn't clear how much further prices may fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jackson said the residential market showed signs of some stabilization in the past two months as inventory, which had reached its highest level in more than 15 years in the third quarter, began to dissipate. He said a 7.4-month supply of apartments was for sale in December, down from 10.4 months in September. A six-month supply is considered equilibrium, with supply matching demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between 2004 and 2006, more than 20,000 new condo units were added to the market, causing an inventory glut. But since this inventory has started to tick down, he said, speculation has somewhat subsided that the market could be facing a major correction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the economy has remained strong, employment is healthy, wages are increasing, the Federal Reserve stopped raising rates and Wall Street bonuses were "exceptionally good," which bodes well for market fundamentals, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, the equity markets have been performing strongly, which lets investors get bigger returns from stocks than real estate. As a result, he said, many people may be reluctant to put their cash into real estate, when the residential market is uncertain.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of existing homes rose for the second consecutive month in November, a sign of rebounding demand that suggests the economic fallout from the housing market's slump will be limited next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes last month increased 0.6% from October to an annual rate of 6.28 million units, down 10.7% from a year earlier. Spurred by lower interest rates and home prices, sales have now increased in back-to-back months for the first time in more than a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Together with a recent upturn in the rate of new-home sales, the modest rise in existing-home sales indicates that home-buying activity may be stabilizing after a yearlong downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The change was small, but the results were encouraging nonetheless because they suggested activity is beginning to form a bottom" said Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the housing slump is indeed bottoming out and starts to reverse itself in the months ahead, it would gradually lift a great weight off the broader economy. Housing-related industries have been shedding thousands of jobs in recent months, and builders have been forced to scale back construction to match waning demand. That has been a major factor behind the slowing economy this year, and many economists say growth -- now running at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of about 2.0% -- won't fully bounce back until the housing correction has run its course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, it is far from certain that the housing slump is over. Inventories of unsold homes remained large in November, with a 7.3-month supply on the market at current sales rates, according to NAR data, up from a five-month supply a year earlier. That suggests builders will continue to cut production until supply is better aligned with demand. In the meantime, large inventories will continue to put downward pressure on prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month's median home price -- the price at which half of homes sold for more and half sold for less -- was down 3.1% from a year earlier. November was the fourth month in a row that median home prices were down from a year earlier. NAR President Pat Vredevoogd Combs described current conditions as a "window for buyers" to re-enter the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additional support for a rebound is coming from the competitive labor market, which is producing solid wage gains and lifting consumer sentiment. Yesterday, the Conference Board, a private research group in New York, said its gauge of consumer confidence rose to 109 in December from 105.3 in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As with the recent data on housing, which generated more relief than enthusiasm among economists, the improved sentiment reading was due more to a moderation in pessimism than any surge in optimism. Indeed, the proportion of those surveyed who said economic conditions are "good" fell slightly to 27.2% this month from 27.5% in November, but that was more than offset by a sharper decline -- to 14.6% from 16.2% in November -- in the number who said the climate is "bad."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than anything, the data suggest the nation's economy will be able to maintain its current pace of slow-to-moderate growth as the housing imbalance is corrected. "There's nothing signaling a severe downturn or a severe upturn," said Lynn Franco, who oversees the Conference Board survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the number of people filing initial claims for unemployment benefits rose slightly, to 317,000 last week from 316,000 the week before. The figures point to steady job growth. </p>

</div><div class="author">By Christopher Conkey </div><div>598 words</div><div>28 December 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Recent firmness in mortgage applications and an increase in new-home sales suggest the housing slump may be nearly over, limiting the risk of wider damage to the overall economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One indication that home-buying demand has leveled off after a yearlong decline comes from the Mortgage Bankers Association, which conducts a weekly mortgage-application survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday, the group said mortgage applications fell sharply last week from the week before. Even so, its indexes of applications for home purchases and refinancings have been rising steadily since summer. The four-week moving average for the MBA's purchase index, which offers a less-volatile picture of the trend, has risen 12% since August, while the four-week average for the group's refinancing index has soared more than 41% since July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent pickup in new-home sales also points to stabilizing demand. The Commerce Department said yesterday that new-home sales rose 3.4% in November to an annual rate of 1.05 million units. While that pace is down more than 15% from a year earlier, it has risen since July and has held fairly steady in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite some continued uncertainty, economists view the recent data as an early indication that the worst of the housing market's downturn may be over. "The net of all the numbers we've gotten is that it looks like the housing market and home sales appear to have stabilized, at least temporarily, in the latter part of the year," said Thomas Lawler, a former economist for Fannie Mae who now runs a consulting firm in Vienna, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If this turns out to be the case, and the housing market begins to rebound next year, the economy would be likely to benefit. The slump has been one of the biggest dampers on the nation's economic growth. In the third quarter, for example, the decline in home building and residential investment shaved more than one percentage point off the annual rate of economic growth. Many economists expect a similar reduction in the fourth quarter but expect some improvement next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chances of a pickup in 2007 partly depend on whether home builders can trim their inventories of unsold homes. Last month, there were 545,000 new homes on the market, or the equivalent of a 6.3-month supply at current sales rates, according to the Commerce data, down from a recent high mark of a 7.2-month supply in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-buying activity could wane, however, if interest rates rise or other factors, such as employment or the stock market, deteriorate. Economists expect the normally quiet winter months to produce volatile readings and say the best gauge of the housing market will be whether buyers come out in force as usual in the spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a new home -- or the price at which half sold for more and half sold for less -- was $251,700 last month, up from $237,900 a year earlier, the Commerce Department said. The figures aren't adjusted to account for the changing mix of sales. Thus, the November reading may have been distorted by the fact that sales in the higher-priced Northeast rose last month, while sales in lower-priced South fell.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales increased by 0.6%, after rising 0.5% in October, the National Association of Realtors said. The back-to-back increases were the first since March and April 2005. In a separate report, the National Association of Purchasing Management Chicago said its index of area business activity rose to 52.4 in December on a seasonally adjusted basis, a level that reflects expansion. Also, consumer confidence this month shot higher. Economists and others weigh in on the data. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--- </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All three indicators firmer than generally expected, revealing a rebound in industrial conditions in the Midwest, a firming in consumer confidence and labor market attitudes, and stabilization in sales of existing homes. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Goldman Sachs Economics </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--- </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer confidence has recovered sharply in the second half of 2006, even in the face of a substantial housing correction, helped by solid labor market conditions and a plunge in gas prices. While we do not put great stock in the confidence data, they are consistent with our expectation that the downturn in the housing sector will not trigger a major retrenchment in consumer spending. -- Michelle Girard, RBS Greenwich Capital </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--- </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales peaked during summer 2005 and fell hard between then and September. However, in the past two months, home re-sales appear to have stabilized. Slower sales have kept inventories of unsold homes at very high levels although they are beginning to trend lower. In turn, this has pressured prices, which are now falling. Further declines are anticipated. Although home sales appear to be stabilizing, home construction will continue to shrink. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Steven Wood, Insight Economics </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--- </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suppose [housing] sales have stabilized. Does this mean the worst is now behind? Unfortunately, housing permits are still falling, which points to further declines in starts. Until inventories are drawn down -- and stronger sales will help do this -- permits and starts will continue to fall. This means that spending on residential construction will also continue to drop. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Patrick Newport, Global Insight </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--- </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total existing home sales are at the highest level since August, while single-family sales are at the highest level since June. . . . This report appears to provide more evidence that the housing market may be stabilizing. The NAR declared that the "housing contraction has bottomed." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Bear Stearns Economics </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--- </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is simply no getting around a few basic facts: 1) While [home] sales aren't falling sharply anymore, they're not improving much, either. 2) Supply is still at astronomically high levels and 3) Homes remain relatively unaffordable, despite the recent minor declines we've seen in mortgage rates and home prices. It's going to take bigger price concessions . . . more incentives . . . and most importantly, lots of TIME to work off these conditions. In other words, 2007 should be another weak year for the housing market." </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- New-home sales in the U.S. climbed in November and inventories fell, a signal the housing market might be stabilizing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of single-family homes increased 3.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.047 million, the U.S. Commerce Department said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While sales were down 15.2% from November 2005, the 3.4% increase from October was larger than expected and was the third rise in six months. Sales were up 3.1% in September and 4.3% in August, but down 9.2% in July and 2.1% in June.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"On net, this is a positive report, suggesting stabilization in the housing market," Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. economist Michelle Meyer wrote. "The rise in demand and fall in supply suggests the imbalance is starting to correct."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Census Bureau counts a house as sold when the contract is signed," Global Insight U.S. economist Patrick Newport said. "If a buyer has second thoughts and cancels the initial contract, however, census does not readjust the numbers. As a result, sales are overstated and inventories understated for the month the house is initially sold. And when the house is eventually sold, sales are understated and inventories overstated. Lacking data on cancellations, it is impossible to tell if November's estimates should be higher or lower."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate on a 30-year mortgage has held in a narrow range in recent weeks. Freddie Mac this past week reported the rate at 6.13%, compared with 6.12% the week before and 6.11% two weeks earlier. On Oct. 26, Freddie Mac reported the weekly rate at 6.40%. The Mortgage Bankers Association said a measure of mortgage-loan-application volume decreased last week 14.2% to an index level of 555.8 from 647.6 the week earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales in November rose 22.4% in the U.S. Midwest, 22.5% in the Northeast, and 19% in the West. In the South, sales fell 9.3%. Based on figures unadjusted for seasonal factors, an estimated 72,000 homes were sold in November, down from 78,000 in October.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home inventories fell 1.4% in November to 545,000 homes. Housing starts are 25.5% lower than a year earlier, recent data show.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing sector is a big thorn in the side of the U.S. economy, which slowed in the third quarter to a 2% annualized rate. The housing component of gross domestic product plummeted 18.7%, which was the sharpest drop in 15 years and robbed GDP of 1.20 percentage points.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surging demand in certain markets across the U.S. during the housing boom sent prices skyward and builders breaking ground. Sales peaked in 2005 and began receding, while inventories climbed, resulting in a building slowdown.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the November sales rate of 1.047 million, it would take 6.3 months to exhaust the supply of unsold homes. While below October's 6.7 months and the lowest level since 6.2 in May, the rate in November 2005 was 4.9.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales climbed in November and inventories fell, a signal the slumping housing market might be stabilizing. Sales of single-family homes increased by 3.4% from October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.047 million, the Commerce Department said.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--- </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the surface, the report suggests that sales are bottoming. While this may end up being true, it is premature to draw this conclusion given the stabilization in long-term interest rates that has occurred in recent weeks and the sharp drop in mortgage applications reported by the Mortgage Bankers Association for the last two weeks (a 15.6% drop in purchase loan applications). </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Goldman Sachs Economics </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--- </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strong report. November sales . . . rose more than expected, and there were significant upward revisions to August through October totaling 46,000 units. The combination of higher sales and the recent plunge in starts led to a fourth straight decline in inventories and a six-month low for the inventory/sales ratio. . . . With sales having risen 7% since troughing in July and housing completions having falling 8% over this period, the inventory situation is starting to show some meaningful improvement. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Morgan Stanley Research </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--- </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">November's new sales numbers are encouraging . . . .. Unfortunately, the estimates are also tainted, and difficult to interpret. The main problem is that cancellations are muddying the sales and inventory numbers. The Census Bureau counts a house as sold when the contract is signed. If a buyer has second thoughts and cancels the initial contract, however, Census does not readjust the numbers. As a result, sales are overstated and inventories understated for the month the house is initially sold. And when the house is eventually sold, sales are understated and inventories overstated.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--- </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although no doubt this report was boosted by the mild weather in parts of the country, the pickup in sales and decline in the number of homes for sale provide further tentative evidence that the housing market is stabilizing. The major caveat with this conclusion is the failure of this report to track cancellations. Despite this, however, unless cancellations are picking up further from the levels seen in the third quarter, it appears that home sales and construction are in better balance than they have been for some time. </p>

</div><div class="author">By Ruth Simon </div><div>1314 words</div><div>23 December 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BATTLE-SCARRED mom-and-pop investors are still dabbling in real estate. But they are changing the rules of engagement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the housing boom, many individual investors went deep into debt to buy investment properties -- rental homes and condos -- in hopes of selling quickly. The goal: Cash in on soaring prices. They may have had little or no intention of being landlords for the long haul.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the end of the speculative craze, a number of markets in the fragmented real-estate world continue to lure investors willing to adjust their expectations. One key move: As rents take off, buyers increasingly focus on multiunit rental properties instead of the single-family condos and homes that were popular during the housing boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some investors are also shifting money into regions of the country where they expect prices to continue to rise, such as Texas, the Kansas City area and parts of North Carolina.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers are also crafting special promotions, such as guaranteed rental income for as long as five years. Deals like these are particularly common in Florida, but they are also appearing in other markets, including Philadelphia and Myrtle Beach, S.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another major shift: Most investors are focusing on the fundamentals that guided the market before the housing boom, especially cash flow -- the ability to actually make money from, say, rentals, rather than from quickly selling the property. They are sticking with properties that turn a profit (or at least break even) after factoring in interest payments, taxes and other expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is a change from the past few years, when speculators were willing to lose money each month in hopes of selling for a big gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Making a minimum of $50 to $125 monthly on each house is what we're shooting for," says Wendy Kallberg, a recent investor in Newport News, Va., who has purchased four single-family homes and condos over the past year at prices ranging from $67,000 to $140,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm not interested in flips," Ms. Kallberg adds. "In six or seven years, I will go and sell the property."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big risks remain for investors in residential property. The National Association of Realtors reported that the median price of an existing home in October was down 3.5% from a year earlier, the largest decline since the group began collecting these data in the late 1960s. And a glut of unsold homes could continue to keep prices in check.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many investors have fled. The number of borrowers taking out mortgages to buy investment properties was off more than 70% in the third quarter from a year earlier, sayso First American LoanPerformance, a unit of First American Corp. Meanwhile, investors' share of home purchases fell to 8.4% in the first nine months of this year from 9.5% a year earlier, says LoanPerformance. Five years ago, that share was less than 6%. (Figures don't include investors who paid cash or financed their purchases by tapping the equity in their existing home.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the biggest declines in investor purchases are in once-hot markets where speculators helped drive prices to unsustainable levels. In places such as southern Florida, Phoenix, Las Vegas, San Diego and Washington, D.C., "the numbers just don't make sense for long-term investors . . . unless they are able to buy at a strong discount," says Jack McCabe, a real-estate consultant in Deerfield Beach, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, demand for investment properties remains healthy in some parts of the country. In the Charlotte, N.C., area, investors have been snapping up raw land and developing it for builders who are moving into the area as other housing markets cool, says Wallace Perry, president of Coldwell Banker United, Carolinas region. Land prices are rising at 10% to 15% annually, nearly twice as fast as home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Kansas City area, out-of-state buyers are fueling demand for small and midsize apartment buildings, says William Hargis, a broker in Overland Park, Kan., with Reece &amp;Nichols, a unit of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Investor demand has also been strong in many parts of Texas. "We're seeing a lot of people from other parts of the country" coming to town to buy investment properties, says Steve Hendry of Re/Max Associates of Dallas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With home prices softening in many markets, some advisers are counseling clients to focus on multifamily and commercial properties. Homes and condos are "not the place for a person who wants to make good, solid real-estate investments," says Jim Lumley, a broker in Amherst, Mass., who has written about real-estate investing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small apartment buildings and commercial properties are "more stable" investments, he says. "You've got a number of people paying rent."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anthony Reed, an agent with Long Realty Co. in Tucson, is seeing increased interest in commercial properties because asking prices for many residential properties "are unrealistic." Investors "expect the property to at least pay the mortgage with a 20% or 25% down payment," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yields on commercial properties have fallen over the past four years, but rent growth is strong as vacancy levels decline, says Youguo Liang, a managing director for Prudential Real Estate Investors, a unit of Prudential Financial Inc. "If you balance the two factors, it's not the best time and it's not the worst time," he says, adding that conditions "slightly favor investors."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The situation is bleaker for those buying homes and condos as an investment, says Mr. Liang. "They should have very limited expectations on appreciation going forward -- probably 0% to 3% annually for the next five years," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many speculators who bought property during the boom may now be facing a tough choice. They can either lose a moderate amount of money each month while they wait for the market to rebound, or they can sell and take the pain all at once. Refinancing the mortgage could help under certain circumstances, such as when a borrower has an adjustable-rate mortgage that has reset to a higher interest rate. But for those who took out exotic mortgages with low monthly payments, refinancing may bring no relief.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some investors keep their eyes out for special situations, such as properties being unloaded by people who took on too much debt or invested unwisely during the housing boom. Willam H. Lublin, chief executive of Century 21 Advantage Gold in Philadelphia, says he is now taking a look at two groups of properties currently owned by investors in financial distress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the market for homes and condos has cooled, some developers are unveiling special promotions designed to appeal to investors worried about cash flow. In Philadelphia, Maxwell Realty Co. is telling qualified investors who purchase units in two condo projects that the developer will pick up the difference if their rental income doesn't cover monthly operating costs during a two-year period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the program, the developer finds a tenant for the property and is responsible for monthly mortgage payments, condo fees and real-estate taxes, provided the buyer puts 10% down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Hollywood, Fla., Kim Kirschner of Kirschner Realty International is working with several developers who have created similar incentive programs, designed to give investors "break-even or some type of [positive] cash flow for a two-to-three-year period."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeff McConkey, broker-owner of the Avista Group of Keller Williams Realty in Tampa, says he's working with several condominium developers who are offering a "rental-assurance" program that stretches for as long as five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But investors should approach such offers cautiously, advises Mr. McCabe, the Florida real-estate consultant. "We're seeing a lot of developers and builders right now . . . breaking their promises to buyers," he says.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">The Home Front: Land's Slippery Slope --- Prices of Residential Lots Fall More Than Those of Homes; No Room for Wolfhounds</span>
</div><div class="author">By June Fletcher </div><div>1687 words</div><div>22 December 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>W10</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DURING THE real-estate boom and recent slowdown, the focus has been almost entirely on the price of homes. But land prices have taken an even wilder ride.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential lot prices in or near many metro areas across the country, including Boston, Washington, D.C., and Naples, Fla., have plummeted in the past year -- some as much as 29%. Big landowners are feeling the pain, too. According to Chicago-based Grubb &amp;Ellis, a commercial brokerage, the median price of parcels averaging between 40 and 94 acres is $162,000 per acre year-to-date, 28% below the 2004 price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The falling prices contradict the view that buying land is a safer bet than investing in bricks and mortar. In fact, lot prices have been far more volatile lately, buffeted by zoning laws, environmental regulations and other market forces. Meanwhile, adjusting for inflation, the cost to build a good-quality single-family house has remained relatively stable since 1980 at around $100 to $125 a square foot, according to Joseph Gyourko, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. "Land is a risky investment," Mr. Gyourko says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all markets are experiencing steep declines, according to data from multiple-listing services and brokers. In Houston, for example, where the oil and gas industry is going strong and creating new jobs, median lot prices grew 15.8% in the third quarter of 2006 compared with the same period last year, while median home prices rose 5.5%. In Portland, Ore., lot prices rose 28.9%, while home prices rose 10.62%. But overall, brokers and researchers say, there have been many more cool markets than hot ones in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Boston, in the throes of its weakest housing market since the early '90s, the price of a lot fell 24.5% in the third quarter, while home prices fell 9.8%. In Naples, Fla., which was recently overrun and then abandoned by speculators, lot prices plummeted 28.7% in the same period, while home prices dropped 5.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason land prices go to extremes is that the supply of lots is much less flexible than the supply of homes for sale, says Morris Davis, a University of Wisconsin housing economist. Builders can ramp up construction in hot areas or pull back in cool ones, fine-tuning the housing supply and mitigating pricing fluctuations. But the supply of "infill" lots in or near cities is relatively fixed, not counting the occasional teardown; that makes their prices more sensitive to market swings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although lot prices aren't tracked nationally by government agencies or trade groups, for-sale-by-owner Web site Owners.com says that overall, the median price for a typical 1.13-acre lot on the site was $99,500 in October, down 9.6% from a year ago. Meanwhile, the median U.S. home price in October was $221,000, down 3.5% during the same period -- a record year-over-year decline, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in many areas, lot sellers have been discounting even more deeply, without success. In Columbus, Ohio, information-technology specialist Rick Field has been unable to sell his five-acre lot bordering a pond in a custom-home subdivision, even though he's lowered his price by 15%, to $117,900. Meanwhile, median home prices there have fallen just 3.3%. Mr. Field says he bought the property two years ago, intending to build himself a custom home, and then decided to buy an existing house elsewhere. "I didn't think [the lot] would be that hard to sell," he says. "It's very frustrating." In Cape Coral, Fla., computer programmer Lynn Oliver has cut the price of her 15,000- square-foot canal-front lot by 27%, to $309,000, although home prices have fallen just 8% over the past year. "The market is harsh," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market is equally difficult for developers, farmers and others who sell large tracts to big builders. Many of these builders are wiggling out of options to buy land and shedding lots by the thousands. Horsham, Pa.-based Toll Brothers, for instance, trimmed its land position by 6,500 lots in the fiscal third quarter over the previous quarter, a decline of 19%, and projects that it will shed an additional 10,000 lots in the year ahead. These tracts, generally too big to be of use to anyone but a large builder, are rarely sold off piecemeal and don't directly affect prices of infill lots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In slumping markets, brokers say, land sellers may not be able to do much to make their listings more attractive to buyers, other than to cut prices, offer owner financing and closing-cost help, and make sure engineering studies, permits and utilities are in order. Still, carrying costs for land tend to be much lower than they are for houses, since there are no utilities to pay, driveways to shovel or faucets to fix (although there are taxes to pay). So unless there's some compelling reason to sell, lot owners are often in a better position to weather a down market. "You can just sit on it," says Naples real-estate agent Eydie Heller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Land prices aren't falling everywhere in the country, of course. In hot markets like Houston, it's the buyers who are feeling the pinch. Michael Pearce wants to build a home with a big backyard so his two white Russian wolfhounds, Romeo and Rosalyn, have room to roam. The 34-year-old attorney has been shopping for property near his downtown workplace, but so far, the only lots he's been able to find in neighborhoods that he likes are about 5,000 square feet and cost between $200,000 and $300,000. That's more than he wanted to pay, for less space than he really wants. But since prices have doubled since he first started shopping a year ago, he plans to make an offer soon. "I feel under pressure to buy," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No Room to Move</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A strong economy isn't the only thing that's pushed up land prices in some markets. In Paradise Valley, a pricey suburb of Phoenix, rules that require houses to be on minimum lots of at least two acres have pushed land prices over the $1 million mark. And in Westchester County, N.Y., where most of the land is already built up and a quick commute to Manhattan is a major draw, it's difficult to find even a sliver of undeveloped property. Consequently, the vacant land market is doing markedly better than the housing market, says Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., broker Lisa Pazer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For investors in markets like this with very few lots to flip, that leaves only one solution: create new ones by tearing down some old houses. Oddly enough, the resulting "recycled" empty lot can be more valuable than the lot was before with a house on it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Westchester County contractor Joseph Forgione and his wife, Patricia, a real-estate broker, bought a ranch house on four acres in Purchase, N.Y., that once belonged to the father of actor Eddie Fisher. Before they purchased the property at a bankruptcy sale, it had been on the market for $2.4 million. But after the Forgiones bought it and tore down the house, offers began to roll in -- even though the new asking price was $3.7 million. In fact, interest has been so high that the Forgiones recently upped the price to $4.2 million, a 13.5% increase from last year. Home prices in the area have been essentially flat for the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clamoring to pay a premium for something that buyers could get more cheaply simply by buying an old place on a big lot and renting a bulldozer for a day seems counterintuitive, but Ms. Forgione thinks the explanation is, in part, psychological. An empty lot is a clean slate, so buyers project their grandest fantasies on it -- and that makes it seem more valuable. "As with everything else, new sells," she says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"></p><pre class="articlePre">                          Lots to Choose From 
  Residential lots for sale can be found on most brokers' sites as well as on 
Realtor.com, eBay and Craigslist. Some Web sites specialize in them, 
however. Here are a few examples. 
 
  WEB SITE: landandfarm.com 
  WHAT IT LISTS: About 2,000 residential parcels. 
  COMMENTS: Properties tend to skew toward the rural rather than the 
suburban, such as an $18 million, 3,000-acre Georgia hunting retreat. 
 
  WEB SITE: elandusa.com 
  WHAT IT LISTS: About 2,600 ads, U.S. only. Some are huge estates with 
large existing houses. 
  COMMENTS: This site sorts listings by state, but not by price, size or 
property type. The only way to shop is to slog through all the state's 
listings, which can be daunting. Tennessee, for example, has more than 400. 
 
  WEB SITE: landauction.com 
  WHAT IT LISTS: Lots and land that are being sold at auction in 15 states 
plus Hong Kong. 
  COMMENTS: The company owns the land it sells and provides financing for 
purchases over $1,000, but some parcels lack road access and may be 
unbuildable. Online bids allowed. 
 
  WEB SITE: land-fsbo.com 
  WHAT IT LISTS: Some 250 lots stateside, with a heavy concentration in 
Florida, California and Arizona, plus a smattering from abroad. 
  COMMENTS: This is a for-sale-by-owner Web site, so the listings aren't 
comprehensive for any area. Included are one-acre lots for $24,000 near the 
Grand Canyon. 
 
  WEB SITE:  www.land.net[http://www.land.net]  
  WHAT IT LISTS: Land listings and auctions in the U.S. and more than 200 
other countries. 
  COMMENTS: Many of the ads are for parcels zoned for commercial and 
industrial use, but there are a few custom lots mixed in.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leeza Lists</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TALK-SHOW host Leeza Gibbons and her husband, actor and architect Stephen Meadows, are asking just under $8 million for their Los Angeles home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The eight-bedroom Mediterranean-style home, on a gated one-acre property just off Hollywood Boulevard, dates from the 1920s, Mr. Meadows says. The house has two kitchens and a large bathroom in the master suite that was converted from another bedroom. Ms. Gibbons and her husband bought the property in 1991 for nearly $2 million, public records show. Mr. Meadows says of their renovations, "I don't think there was a three-week period where we didn't have a contractor's truck in the driveway for that entire 15 years." He also designed and built a one-bedroom guest house with an office and artist studio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Gibbons, 49 years old, is a former reporter and anchor for "Entertainment Tonight"; she hosted the daytime talk show "Leeza" from 1994 to 2000 and now hosts the nationally syndicated radio show "Hollywood Confidential." Mr. Meadows, 56, has had numerous television guest roles. The couple separated last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drew Mandile and Brooke Knapp of Sotheby's International Realty have the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home of Late Bendel Chief</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sells After Steep Discount</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE LONGTIME Connecticut home of the late Geraldine Stutz, the former president of New York's Henri Bendel department store, has sold for about $2.6 million -- less than half its original asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three-bedroom, 1740s Colonial-style house is in the Litchfield County town of Roxbury, about 85 miles northeast of Manhattan. The roughly nine-acre property, which is along the Shepaug River, also has a pool, pond, caretaker's cottage and barn. The grounds were designed by British artist and landscape architect Russell Page.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Stutz, who headed Henri Bendel for 29 years, owned the property for more than 20 years. Her estate put it on the market in June 2005, shortly after her death at 80, with an asking price of $5.5 million. The price was cut a number of times, most recently to $3.55 million. Carolyn Klemm of Klemm Real Estate had the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Litchfield County's real-estate market has been relatively flat recently. The median home price declined slightly in the third quarter of this year from the year-earlier period, but the average price rose by a small amount, according to data provided by the Connecticut Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kathryn Clair of Sotheby's International Realty represented the buyers, Steven Feder-Trosclair, a New York businessman in the online learning and marketing sector, and his partner, Lou Thomas Feder-Trosclair. Earlier this year, Steven Feder-Trosclair sold a Fort Lauderdale property for $5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sotheby's Executive Buys</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Landscape: 54 Acres</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ABOUT FIVE MILES west of Ms. Stutz's estate, Tobias Meyer, who heads the contemporary-art department for the auction house Sotheby's, and his partner, Mark Fletcher, have bought a 54-acre property for $1.3 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The undeveloped land is in New Milford, near the New York border. Mr. Meyer and Mr. Fletcher, an art adviser, bought the property from the architect A. Eugene Kohn and his wife, investment banker Barbara Shattuck Kohn, who acquired it three years ago for $1.2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to listing agent Seymour Surnow of Sotheby's International Realty, Mr. Kohn planned to design a house for the property but instead bought another home in nearby Washington, Conn. Mr. Fletcher confirmed that he and Mr. Meyer bought the property but declined further comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Messrs. Meyer and Fletcher will join several other prominent art-world figures in Litchfield County, including Jasper Johns, who has a home and studio in Sharon; Agnes Gund, the former president of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, who has a home in Kent; and Amy Cappellazzo, Mr. Meyer's counterpart at rival Christie's, who bought a home in Roxbury last year.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Housing Industry May Slow Despite Rebound in Starts</span>
</div><div class="author">By Christopher Conkey </div><div>729 words</div><div>20 December 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Home building rebounded a bit in November from a big October plunge, but the housing sector is likely to remain a drag on the economy until a large inventory of unsold homes is reduced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wholesale prices, meanwhile, jumped last month, although most of that jump was because of higher light-truck prices and fuel. Outside those sectors, there was little evidence of broad price pressures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of new-home construction rose 6.7% in November, following a 13.7% drop in October, the Commerce Department reported, putting the rate of housing starts 25.5% lower than a year earlier. Favorable weather may have contributed to last month's increase in housing starts, but building permits, a sign of future activity that is less affected by weather patterns, fell 3% in November from October and were 31.3% lower than a year ago. Moreover, a fundamental imbalance between supply and demand suggests builders will have to scale back production in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main reason: Builders haven't cut back construction enough to match the weaker pace of sales this year. That has created a glut of unsold homes, forcing builders to offer incentives or lower prices in a bid to attract buyers and ward off cancelled sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, Hovnanian Enterprises Inc., a New Jersey-based builder, said its cancellation rate soared to 35% in its fiscal fourth quarter, up from 25% a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Despite healthy job growth . . . and low mortgage rates, most housing markets have been adversely impacted by heightened inventories of both new and existing homes for sale," said Ara Hovnanian, the company's chief executive, in a written statement. "We are continuing to manage assuming that current conditions remain with us for the foreseeable future."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October, the Commerce Department estimated the inventory of new homes for sale was the equivalent of a seven-month supply, up from a 4.5-month supply a year earlier. In fact, the inventory of unsold homes is almost certainly much larger than the government data suggest. That is because sales cancellations aren't included, even though such homes go back on the market. If cancellations were included, the inventory of new homes for sale would be closer to an 8.5-month supply, according to David Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many other economists, Mr. Seiders expects the pace of new-home construction to bottom out early next year as builders shave supply to better match demand. In the process, Mr. Seiders predicted, reduced residential investment will trim roughly one percentage point off economic growth in the fourth quarter, just as it did in the third quarter, and slightly less in the first quarter of 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the weak housing market is weighing on economic growth, it is unlikely for now to persuade the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. "The housing industry is undergoing a sharp correction that may not have run its full course, and auto production is more anemic than desirable," Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Richard Fisher said yesterday in a speech to the Longview Rotary Club in Longview, Texas. But, he added, inflation is "still too high," and he would press for higher interest rates "if inflation does not ratchet downward."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One sign that inflation may still pose a threat came in a Labor Department report showing that wholesale prices rose 2% in November following a 1.6% drop in October. Prices excluding food and energy increased 1.3% last month after falling 0.9% in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists, though, largely dismissed the unusually steep spike in producer prices last month as due more to unusual volatility in motor-vehicle pricing than any broader-based flare up. "I'm ignoring the producer price" report, said Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America, Inc. "It's just too wild a number. If you look beyond motor vehicles, it's not as volatile."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another mitigating factor: Consumer prices were unchanged in November. That suggests businesses, even if they faced higher wholesale prices, were unable to pass them on to consumers last month. That could change in the months ahead if inflationary pressures continue, many economists said. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[What's Brewing in the Real Estate Market]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subprime Blues</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Depending how you look at it, the surge in subprime home-mortgage lending of recent years has been either a way to help financially stressed people achieve home ownership -- or a disaster in the making.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A study from the Center for Responsible Lending, a Durham, N.C., nonprofit research and lobbying group, opts for the latter view. The center examines subprime loans originated from 1998 through this year's third quarter. (Subprime loans are those issued to people with tarnished credit records or high debt in relation to income.) The center estimates that ultimately 2.2 million of those loans, or 15% of the total, will end in foreclosure. That includes about 488,000 foreclosures already recorded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The center blames lenders for making loans without adequately considering whether homeowners will be able to meet the payments after the interest rate rises from the initial low "teaser" rate, typically after two years. It also criticizes lenders for reducing requirements for borrowers to verify their income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doug Duncan, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association, a trade group for lenders, called the foreclosure forecast "unduly pessimistic" and said it relied on a gloomy forecast for home prices. But the National Association of Realtors, which frequently tangles with banks on regulatory issues, joined the Center for Responsible Lending in raising alarm bells about a jump in foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cooling Condos</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prestige Builders Partners, a Miami Lakes, Fla., property owner and condominium converter has sold 11 Florida rental apartment complexes for around $500 million to Goldman Sachs Group's real-estate unit, Archon Group LP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale comes as the condo conversion market in Florida has slowed, and condo sales have plummeted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prestige acquired the 2,900-unit rental portfolio with the potential to convert to condominiums, says Ernie Horsely, Prestige's president. But instead, the company has decided to sell. "It enables us to reduce our apartment holding inventory and continue with our other projects," he says. Prestige still has seven other properties it is converting from rental apartments to for-sale units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condo sales in Florida have stalled during the past year, causing converters to keep their buildings as rentals or sell them. Sales volume for condos has dropped 33% through October from the year earlier, according to the Florida Association of Realtors. Rents, on the other hand, have been rising at a healthy clip: 5% to 7% for the year in most Florida markets, according to Reis Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tracking Returns</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two big names in the real-estate research world are teaming up to launch an index that tracks property returns to support the trading of derivatives of commercial property. Several other companies have recently started similar ventures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real Capital Analytics Inc., a national real estate research firm with offices in New York and San Jose, Calif., will provide a database of property transactions for a set of indexes developed by the MIT Center for Real Estate. The two partners today are launching 29 indexes, which will include national, regional and metropolitan markets returns by sector -- such as office, apartment and industrial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The information is used by investors to bet on performance of commercial real estate and to hedge against market turns. Real Capital Analytics and MIT say their product will be different because the indexes will be based on repeat sales transactions of individual properties valued at $2.5 million or more. Some other products are using other inputs such as interest rates and rental rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But using transaction data can have its own pitfalls, which was taken into account by MIT's statisticians. What if there aren't enough transactions in a given period to get an adequate measure? If volume drops below the minimum number required for a valid sample in a market -- Washington, D.C., for example -- the scope would be widened to, in this case, sales in East Coast markets.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. wholesale prices soared last month at their fastest pace in more than three decades on sharply higher gasoline and light-truck prices, suggesting inflationary risks linger despite a recent soft consumer-price report.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separate data showed home construction climbed during November but recovered only part of the sharp drop of the month before, while permits for future building fell for a 10th consecutive month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The producer-price index for finished goods rose 2% in November from October -- the highest rate since November 1974 -- after decreasing 1.6% in October, the Labor Department said. The core PPI, which excludes food and energy, rose 1.3%, the highest rate since July 1980, reversing October's 0.9% drop.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inflation numbers were well above Wall Street estimates. The median forecast of 19 economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires was for a 0.7% month-to-month increase in the PPI and a 0.3% rise in the core rate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the 12 months ended in November, overall wholesale prices rose 0.9%. Though that's an increase from October's pace, it remains well below annual rates in the spring and early summer. The core PPI rose 1.8% from a year earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The wholesale-price data take some of the shine off Friday's report that the core consumer-price index was unchanged in November. That news had fueled hopes that the Federal Reserve would have more flexibility to lower rates next year in response to any weakness in the economy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed on Dec. 12 held interest rates steady at 5.25% for a fourth straight meeting but maintained its bias toward higher rates should inflation persist, a bias that seems supported by the PPI report.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday's report showed producer prices for energy increased 6.1% last month from October. Gasoline climbed 17.9%, the biggest one-month jump since June 2000. Gasoline prices had fallen sharply in the previous two months. Food prices rose 0.1%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wholesale prices of passenger cars climbed 2.2%, while those of light trucks surged a record 13.7%. Car and light-truck prices had fallen in October, due in part to new quality-adjustment measures incorporated by government statisticians. Capital-equipment prices rose 1.4% last month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deeper in the production pipeline, price pressures remained elevated. Prices of raw materials, known as crude goods, rose 15.7%; excluding food and energy, they rose 0.5%. Intermediate-goods prices rose 0.7%, though with food and energy excluded they were down 0.3%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, housing starts increased 6.7% to a seasonally adjusted 1.588 million annual rate, the Commerce Department said. The department also revised upward its estimate for October starts, though the decline remains sharp: It now says housing starts fell by 13.7% to 1.488 million rather than by 14.6% to 1.486 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the 12 months ended in November, housing construction tumbled 25.5%.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- The dollar was little changed against the euro and the yen midafternoon, reversing early gains after a report showed U.S. home builders were a bit more pessimistic about the housing market in December.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar was changing hands at 118.14 yen, up from 118.06 late Friday. The euro was near unchanged at $1.308. The pound was quoted at $1.9473, down from $1.9519.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Home Builders said its seasonally adjusted housing-market index fell to 32 in December from 33 in November. However, home builders are growing more hopeful that home sales could perk up in six months, the report showed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market will likely keep its remaining preholiday powder dry until [producer prices] and housing-starts data" are released today, said analysts at research firm Action Economics.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. producer prices likely rose 0.7% last month after October's 1.6% drop, according to economists polled by MarketWatch. Core producer prices, excluding food and energy, likely rose 0.3% after falling 0.9% in October. ousing starts are expected to have risen to a 1.53 million unit annual rate in November.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Today's Market Forecast]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">False Start</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Figures out today could get bulls braying that the housing slowdown is over. But housing might be in a bigger mess than they think.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires estimate that today's report from the Commerce Department on residential construction will show that the number of new-home-construction projects increased 4.3% in November from October, after adjusting for seasonal swings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the magnitude of the plunge in housing starts in October -- they fell 14.6% to the lowest level since 2000 -- don't be surprised if the bounce is even bigger than that. The monthly starts figures can be incredibly volatile, and changes in weather patterns can make them even more volatile. In much of the country, October was colder than normal and November warmer than normal, which would likely skew starts down one month and then up the next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government's measure of building permits isn't as closely watched by investors as housing starts, but some economists consider it a better measure of the outlook for construction. The number of permits that were issued for future construction projects fell by 31% between September 2005 and October 2006, to levels seen back in 2000. For November, economists think they were little changed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meantime, the number of homes on the market remains a concern. Although the inventory of new homes for sale has fallen slightly since the summer, J.P. Morgan economists note that inventory of existing homes (that is, used) continues to rise. A growing number of homes on the market are vacant, which in many cases probably means they were bought speculatively. When it reported results last night, home builder Hovnanian Enterprises said heavy inventory is cutting into profits and sales, and projected earnings will be below analysts' estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another worry is that builders are sitting on land they secured at high prices. Some, like Hovnanian, are taking charges to write down the value of the holdings. Credit Suisse analyst Ivy Zelman notes they might, in turn, decide to burn through the land by building more and selling the houses off quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would add to the glut of houses, and push prices lower still -- more bad news for bulls who argue the worst is over.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">The Home Front: They'll Take Manhattan -- Still --- Finance Sector Buoys New York As Housing Slips Elsewhere; Big Board CEO's Big Buy</span>
</div><div class="author">By Troy McMullen </div><div>1792 words</div><div>15 December 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>W14</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE STATE OF THE housing market in much of the country may be gloomy but in Manhattan, real-estate brokers are still celebrating -- and record Wall Street year-end bonuses are only part of the reason.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many major metro areas, from Miami to San Diego, the number of homes listed for sale has soared over the past year or two as sales have plunged. Median home prices in the U.S. fell 3.5% in October compared with a year ago, the largest year-over-year drop on record, according to the National Association of Realtors. A new report from UBS AG predicts a continued decline and warns that the slump could "seriously impact the overall economy" in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet despite the national outlook, Manhattan has shown resilience, fueled by lower-than-average unemployment rates, a surging financial sector and a swelling population of millionaires (and billionaires) immune to the impact of a slowdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan's international credentials are unique in the U.S., says Andreas Hoeferp, chief global economist at UBS Wealth Management Research. A power center that attracts major players in fashion, art, media and finance, the island has more in common with other world capitals like London, Hong Kong or Paris. "Like other financial capitals, the real-estate market here is cushioned by a global demand for housing that's unmatched in the U.S.," Mr. Hoeferp says. Still, there could be clouds gathering, some analysts warn, including a glut of new condominiums and possible price declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, the number of homes sold in Manhattan was up about 1% in November versus a year ago (compared to an 11.5% drop in sales nationwide in October), and prices continue to appreciate. Median home prices in the borough rose 17.5% during the same period and 26.8% since November 2004, according to Gregory Heym, chief economist for Realtor Brown Harris Stevens. Manhattan's strength is even more pronounced at the high end, where growing demand for trophy properties is propping up the luxury market. The number of $3 million-plus homes sold was up 6.5% year-on-year in November, according to Mr. Heym.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the big-ticket sales: the $27.5 million paid by New York Stock Exchange Chief Executive John Thain for a two-bedroom duplex apartment at 740 Park Ave., one of the city's most storied addresses. Formerly home to Rockefellers, Vanderbilts and Chryslers, the building's current residents include cosmetics executive Ronald Lauder and Blackstone Group chief Stephen A. Schwarzman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, 38 single-family townhouses priced at $10 million and over sold during the same period, up from 22 last year, says Kirk Henckels, an executive vice president of Stribling Private Brokerage. Those sales include the $53 million that investment banker J. Christopher Flowers paid in October for the century-old, five-story Harkness Mansion on East 75th Street, just off Fifth Avenue. The price for the 20-plus-room limestone mansion, which includes a ballroom, 11 fireplaces and a center atrium, is thought to be the highest paid for a Manhattan residence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The health of the New York real-estate sector is the result of lower unemployment rates than the national average, higher job growth rates and a Dow Jones Industrial Average in record territory. The financial industry, long a bellwether for New York's real-estate economy, is soaring. Through the first nine months of 2006, combined earnings at seven top global securities firms based in New York surged to $39 billion, according to David Trone, a banking analyst at Fox-Pitt, Kelton. Meanwhile, new federal data show the average weekly pay for finance jobs in Manhattan was about $8,300 in the first quarter of 2006, up more than $3,000 per week in three years. A projected $36 billion in bonuses will be doled out this year by the top five investment banks in New York, according to Options Group, an executive search firm, up from a record $21.5 billion in 2005 and nearly a fourfold increase from $8.6 billion in 2002.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's an incredible amount of money out there right now," says Jacky Teplitzky, an executive vice president at Prudential Douglas Elliman. "It's not clear if that funnels into real estate, but it certainly can't hurt."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tatyana Dobryanskaya says she expected to wait until next year before looking for a new apartment. But the 30-year-old fixed income analyst says a bigger-than-expected bonus (she declined to disclose how much) from the investment bank she works for helped to change her plans. She is now in the hunt for something in the $1.5 million-to-$2 million range. "There was really no reason to put this off," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vincent Piazza, a 36-year old research analyst, has moved even faster. He just signed a contract for a new $1-million-plus loft condo in the Wall Street area. It features 10-foot-high ceilings and marble and limestone bathrooms. Mr. Piazza says his year-end bonus is only part of the reason he's buying now. "I waited a year for prices to come down a bit," he says. "They never did."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traditionally, the upper end of the New York market tended to hold its own when the city's overall housing market slowed, largely because wealthy buyers were buffered from market gyrations. That was particularly true during the last boom-bust cycle in the late 1980s, economists say. Now, however, even as the national market cools, the entire Manhattan real-estate market is humming, fueled in part by rising income levels and interest from wealthy out-of-town buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ramesh Vangal, an Indian technology and health-care entrepreneur with homes in Bangalore and Singapore, paid nearly $7 million in October for an apartment on Central Park South. Mr. Vangal says he and his wife and business partner, Katharin, have always loved spending time in Manhattan, but that they bought here for business and financial reasons: "New York has always been an important place to do business, but it's also a good place to invest your money," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the robust New York scene, some real-estate observers see warning signs for Manhattan. More listings are crowding the market and the length of time homes are taking to sell is creeping up. Quarterly data show 7,243 units on the market, compared with 6,926 a year ago. The average time a home spent on the market in the third quarter of 2006 before selling was 92 days, a 28-day increase from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while the number of Manhattan sales rose slightly in November compared with the same period a year ago, some of that lift may be inflated. Condos make up only about one-third of Manhattan's housing stock, but they accounted for roughly 44% of sales last month, according to economist Mr. Heym. And much of that came from new buildings where buyers may have made down-payments months or even years ago. That means many of November's "sales" may have occurred when the overall market was still strong. (New condo sales are only registered when the building is completed and residents move in.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A building boom in the past few years is likely to create a glut next year as new condos are completed. Between 2001 and 2005, there were 21,142 units completed in Manhattan, compared with 12,812 from 1996 to 2000, according to the Real Estate Board of New York. REBNY estimates that there are more than 20,000 new condominium units either under construction or being planned in Manhattan. "The real-estate market here simply cannot sustain that kind of growth," says Nouriel Roubini, a professor of economics at the Stern School of Business at New York University. "Prices will fall very hard."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And brokers shouldn't put too much stock in ballooning Wall Street bonuses. Appraiser Jonathan Miller has analyzed first-quarter sales data since 2003 (bonuses are typically handed out between December and February) and his numbers show no significant bounce in Manhattan home sales, with one year showing a slight decrease. "There's a significant amount of money on the sidelines" in this economy, says Mr. Miller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The potential for a real-estate slowdown and the imminent glut of new units has done little to slow some developers. Hotelier Andre Balazs is erecting two new Manhattan condos and recently broke ground on a third -- a 47-story tower in the Wall Street area. Called William Beaver House, the high-rise will include three penthouses, an outdoor Jacuzzi, a hot tub and a 60-foot lap pool with lounge-deck and bar. "I see this as a place for hard-working, hard-playing Wall Streeters," he says.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Ruth Simon </div><div>1362 words</div><div>13 December 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HIGH HOME PRICES have helped drive many first-time buyers out of the housing market. Now, with prices falling in many areas, there are some signs that buyers are beginning to drift back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The share of first-time home buyers dropped earlier this year to its lowest level since 1987, according to the National Association of Realtors. First-time home buyers now account for 36% of home purchases, according to a study released last month by the Realtors group, down from 40% in the three previous years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time buyers play a key role in the housing market. They provide a source of new demand for homes, and they also make it possible for owners of entry-level properties to trade up, creating a ripple effect that affects higher-priced sectors of the market. Declining affordability has made it difficult for first-time buyers to buy homes in many parts of the country, an important factor in the recent housing downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as more sellers begin to cut their asking prices and rates on fixed-rate mortgages have moved lower, some real-estate agents are reporting renewed interest from people shopping for their first home. Sam Schneiderman, broker-owner of the Greater Boston Home Team, says he has seen "a real surge in first-time buyer activity" in the last two to three weeks as lower prices draw buyers who think the market may be close to bottoming out. Kevin Freadhoff, an agent with Realty Executives of Southern Arizona in Tucson, says in the past 60 days he is seeing first-time buyers "start to warm back up again. They are seeing that houses have become more affordable."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Madison, Wis., rising interest rates and home prices knocked many first-time buyers out of the market early in the year, says Phil Sveum, broker-owner of Coldwell Banker Sveum Realtors. But in the past month, Mr. Sveum has seen an increase in tenants looking to buy their first home. The recent drop in interest rates "has created some momentum for first-time buyers, not to write an offer today, but to start looking again and be serious about moving in January or February," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time buyers are particularly sensitive to rising housing costs, in part because they don't have equity from an existing home they can tap as prices shoot higher. And lower incomes provide less of a cushion when monthly payments climb. In a sign of just how hard it is for first-time buyers to come up with the cash needed to buy a home, 45% of first-time buyers bought their home with no money down, according to the recent National Association of Realtors survey, up from 43% a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But recent data have been encouraging for first-time buyers. The National Association of Realtors reported that the median price of an existing home fell 3.5% in October from a year earlier, the largest decline since the group began collecting these data in the late 1960s. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage now stands at 6.16%, the lowest level since October 2005, according to HSH Associates in Pompton Plains, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A growing number of first-time buyers in Florida's Tampa Bay area are taking advantage of special deals from builders looking to unload newly constructed homes that are bloating their inventories, says Craig Beggins, president of Century 21 Beggins Enterprises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jason Colon, a bank analyst, bought a new three-bedroom, 2 1/2-bath townhouse in Apollo Beach, Fla., last month after looking for his first home for roughly a year. Mr. Colon paid $163,000 for the property, which was originally priced at $242,000. The builder also picked up $5,000 of his closing costs. "It was crazy for me not to jump on it because it was brand-new and I'm buying the model unit, which has all the upgrades," says Mr. Colon. Falling interest rates have made the purchase more affordable, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet affordability remains a problem for many would-be buyers. In the second quarter, buyers had to stretch more than ever before in 25 of the top 50 markets, according to Bank of America analyst Daniel Oppenheim. Even with the recent price declines, he estimates that it would take a further 7% fall in home prices, combined with a 4% annual increase in nominal incomes, to bring affordability back in line with average levels over the past decade by 2008 -- if interest rates remain stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, many first-time buyers had been able to stretch their dollars by taking out adjustable-rate mortgages and so-called affordability mortgages, which allowed them to lower their monthly payments or buy a home with little, if any, down payment. But as short-term interest rates have climbed higher, the benefits of adjustables have declined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, some first-time buyers have become more cautious. Sheila Doyle, an agent with Baird &amp;Warner in Glenview, Ill., says that more of the first-time buyers she works with are getting their parents to help them with a down payment and fewer are financing 90% or 100% of the purchase price. "I don't see them doing the crazy financing that was so frequent last year," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New guidelines for nontraditional mortgages, recently issued by federal banking regulators, could make it tougher for some first-time buyers to use these products. Some lenders are also beginning to tighten their standards as mortgage delinquencies rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many would-be buyers are taking a wait-and-see approach. When home prices were soaring, many first-time buyers jumped to buy houses they could barely afford, believing they would be shut out of the market if they didn't act quickly. Now, with prices falling in many areas, "there's no immediate need to buy, and so they kick the tires more," says Frank Borges LLosa, owner of FranklyRealty.com, a brokerage in Arlington, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arthur Orkisz, a speechwriter in the Washington, D.C., area, says he expects to hold off until at least next summer before buying his first home, "unless something so dramatic happens that it's absolutely silly to pass it up." Giveaways such as flat-screen TVs are "all nice and dandy, but at the end of the day anyone capable of doing the arithmetic realizes that's a gimmick to get me in the door," he says. "That's not enough of an incentive" to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott Steiner, managing broker of Help-U-Sell Lakeview Realty in Lake Elsinore, Calif., says he's getting fewer calls and doing fewer showings for the properties he's listing. But fliers describing the properties are being snapped up faster than ever before -- a sign, he says, that many first-time buyers are taking their time and waiting for the market to stabilize before making a move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In much of the country, renting remains a bargain compared with owning, according to an analysis prepared for The Wall Street Journal by Torto Wheaton Research, a unit of CB Richard Ellis Group Inc. In markets such as Las Vegas, San Diego and Washington, the monthly cost of renting the average apartment is roughly half what it would cost to own the median-price home in the third quarter. "Renting is only marginally less of a bargain" even with the latest decreases in home prices, says Torto Wheaton senior economist Gleb Nechayev.</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>427 words</div><div>12 December 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes listed for sale in 18 major U.S. metropolitan areas at the end of November was down 4% from a month earlier, according to data compiled by ZipRealty Inc., a national real-estate brokerage firm in Emeryville, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline is an encouraging sign for home sellers. Prices have been falling in recent months in many areas, largely because of a glut of unsold homes, and are unlikely to rise again until inventories come down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ZipRealty data cover listings of single-family homes, condominiums and town houses on local multiple-listing services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories of previously occupied homes typically decline modestly in November in most parts of the country, as the approach of the holidays prompts some sellers to take their homes off the market until the new year. During the past 20 years, national inventories have declined by an average of about 2% in November from October, according to Credit Suisse Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market generally has been cooling since mid-2005. Lately, the market has been sending mixed signals, fueling debate about how long the downturn will persist. The National Association of Realtors yesterday predicted sales of previously occupied homes will "rise gradually in 2007 from current levels."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR quoted its chief economist, David Lereah, as saying: "Most of the correction in home prices is behind us, but general gains in value next year will be modest by historical standards." Some other economists expect downward pressure on prices to persist at least through 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One positive sign is that an index of applications for home-purchase mortgages, reported weekly by the Mortgage Bankers Association, has trended upward after falling steeply in late 2005 and the first half of this year. Mortgage interest rates have been declining, making housing more affordable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arthur Frank, a mortgage strategist at Barclays Capital in New York, said in an interview that he believes average home prices will rise 2% to 3% next year, though prices probably will decline in some areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Berner, an economist at Morgan Stanley &amp;Co. in New York, cautioned in a report last week that signs of a bottoming out in the housing market "may be a false dawn." Buyers have an incentive to hold off in anticipation of price cuts from home builders caught with too many unsold houses, Mr. Berner wrote, and the house-buying frenzy of recent years has left little pent-up demand. </p>

</div><div class="author">By Ruth Simon and James R. Hagerty   </div><div>1698 words</div><div>5 December 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans who have stretched themselves financially to buy a home or refinance a mortgage have been falling behind on their loan payments at an unexpectedly rapid pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surge in mortgage delinquencies in the past few months is squeezing lenders and unsettling investors world-wide in the $10 trillion U.S. mortgage market. The pain is most apparent in subprime mortgages, though there are signs it is spreading to other parts of the mortgage market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subprime mortgages are loans made to borrowers who are considered to be higher credit risks because of past payment problems, high debt relative to income or other factors. Lenders typically charge them higher interest rates -- as much as four percentage points more than more-credit-worthy borrowers pay -- one reason subprime mortgages are among the most profitable segments of the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They also have been among the fastest-growing segments. Subprime mortgage originations climbed to $625 billion in 2005 from $120 billion in 2001, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, a trade publication. Like other types of mortgages, subprime home loans are often packaged into securities and sold to investors, helping lenders limit their risks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until the past year or so, delinquency rates were low by historical standards, thanks to low interest rates and rising home prices, which made it easy for borrowers to refinance or sell their homes if they ran into trouble. But as the housing market peaked and loan volume leveled off, some lenders responded by relaxing their lending standards. Now, the downside of that strategy is becoming more apparent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on current performance, 2006 is on track to be one of the worst ever for subprime loans, according to <span class="companylink">UBS AG</span>. "We are a bit surprised by how fast this has unraveled," says Thomas Zimmerman, head of asset-backed securities research at <span class="companylink">UBS</span> . Roughly 80,000 subprime borrowers who took out mortgages packaged into securities this year are behind on their payments, the bank says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though delinquency rates on subprime mortgages originated in the past year have soared to the highest levels in a decade, economists don't expect any significant harm to the nation's economy or financial systems. But if late payments and foreclosures continue to rise at a faster-than-expected pace, the pain could extend beyond homeowners and lenders to the investors who buy mortgage-backed securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several lenders are already feeling the sting. <span class="companylink">H&amp;R Block Inc</span> ., which operates Option One, a major subprime lender, said last week that its mortgage-services unit posted a pretax loss of $39 million in the fiscal second quarter ended Oct. 31, compared with a year-earlier pretax profit of $48.8 million. The Kansas City-based tax-services company said last month it is considering selling Option One, which has been struggling with higher interest rates and defaults, and is closing 12 branch offices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, <span class="companylink">KeyCorp</span> said it reached a deal to sell its subprime Champion Mortgage business. Analysts at <span class="companylink">Friedman, Billings, Ramsey</span> &amp;Co. put the price for the company's subprime mortgage operation at $130 million, "far below" the $200 million to $250 million they expected. A spokeswoman for KeyCorp declined to comment, except to say that <span class="companylink">KeyCorp</span> feels it "definitely generated a fair price" for both the unit and its loan portfolio, which was sold separately. She added that <span class="companylink">KeyCorp</span> was leaving the subprime market because "it no longer fits with our long-term strategic priorities."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soaring delinquencies are making some lenders more cautious, which is likely to put further pressure on the weak housing market. Yesterday, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said that its index for pending home sales for October fell a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.7% from September and was down 13.2% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Delinquency rates have been rising steadily since the middle of 2005. But the trend has accelerated sharply in the past two to three months, according to an analysis by <span class="companylink">UBS</span> . The figures don't include loans that lenders were forced to repurchase because the borrower went into default in the first few months; such repurchases also have increased sharply this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October, borrowers were 60 days or more behind in payments on 3.9% of the subprime home loans packaged into mortgage securities this year, <span class="companylink">UBS</span> says. That's nearly twice the delinquency rate on new subprime loans recorded a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carol Alter, a mail carrier in Aurora, Ohio, says she bought her first home for $99,000 at a sheriff's foreclosure sale in February, but felt pinched right from the start by her nearly $80,000 subprime mortgage. She says closing costs on the loan totaled $6,500, rather than the $2,500 she expected, forcing her to drain her savings and miss payments on her utility bills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Alter says she fell behind on her mortgage payments in June after she hurt her leg and missed several weeks of work. She has been able to stave off foreclosure, she says, with the help of a $2,100 interest-free loan from Neighborhood Development Services in Ravenna, which operates a foreclosure rescue fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How much higher delinquencies further climb will depend in part on the depth of the current housing slump. Mortgage delinquencies generally rise when the housing market cools because borrowers who are in financial trouble find it harder to sell their homes. In addition, if prices fall, they may not have enough equity in their homes to refinance their mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The subprime industry's current troubles can be traced back to 2003 and 2004, when defaults were unusually low. Investors who purchased these loans did well and were eager to buy more. That encouraged lenders to lower their standards, making loans to more people with low credit ratings. Lenders also grew less inclined to demand full documentation of income and assets and more willing to offer "piggyback" loans that allowed borrowers to finance 90% or 100% of the purchase price without being required to buy private mortgage insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many lenders kept introductory "teaser" rates low even after short-term interest rates began rising in June 2005, while increasing the amount the rate could rise on the first adjustment. That meant borrowers would face sharply higher costs when their monthly payments were reset.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fraud has also increased. Some borrowers who took out no- or low-documentation loans were coached by loan officers or mortgage brokers to inflate their incomes and couldn't afford even their first mortgage payment, says Theresa Ortiz, a foreclosure manager with Neighborhood Housing Services of New York City, a nonprofit that works with homeowners in financial trouble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even after the housing market started to cool in late 2005, lenders continued to offer credit on easy terms. Many didn't begin tightening up until a few months ago. Now, they are pulling back. <span class="companylink">Accredited Home Lenders Holding Co</span> ., for example, is doing fewer piggyback and stated-income loans -- or loans that don't require borrowers to fully document their income -- especially for people with lower credit scores. In retrospect, "the tightening process should have started a bit earlier," says James Konrath, Accredited's CEO.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent analyses by <span class="companylink">UBS</span> and by RBS Greenwich Capital show that subprime loans made in 2006 are going into foreclosure at a faster pace than loans made in previous years. In many cases these loans are "so bad right off the bat" and so far beyond the borrower's ability to pay that giving the borrower more time to pay or restructuring the loan wouldn't help, says Michael van Zalingen, director of homeownership services at Neighborhood Housing Services of Chicago, a nonprofit organization that works with financially distressed homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If delinquencies continue to grow, the pain could also be felt by investors who have flooded into the market for subprime securities. Because of the way mortgage-backed securities are structured, investors who buy investment-grade securities aren't likely to be hurt if losses are close to expectations. But if losses on the underlying mortgages substantially exceed expectations, some investors who buy the riskiest slices of subprime securities are likely to rack up losses. These include hedge funds and investors who buy collateralized debt obligations, pools of debt instruments that are often snapped up by foreign buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the underlying loans have gotten riskier, credit-rating agencies are telling issuers of mortgage-backed bonds to set aside more money to cover losses than they did three years ago in order to get an AAA rating for their bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some recent deals are already coming under review. <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's Corp</span> . put one deal backed by loans issued by <span class="companylink">Fremont General Corp</span> .'s mortgage unit on credit watch for possible downgrade last month and says it could take similar action on deals from several other issuers within the next few months. Fremont declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are really monitoring very, very closely the portfolios of all the subprime issuers," says Ernestine Warner, head of RMBS Surveillance. "It's an industrywide trend."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, <span class="companylink">Moody's Investors Service</span> put a third 2006 deal on credit watch for a possible downgrade. <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> also has a 2006 deal on credit watch. When mortgage-backed securities are downgraded it is typically during their third or fourth year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Predicting losses on these securities is a challenge because there's little or no historical evidence to show how subprime loans will perform at a time when home prices are falling, says Thomas Lawler, a housing economist in Vienna, Va. An analysis by <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch &amp;Co</span> . found that losses on recent subprime deals could be "in the 6% to 8% range" if home prices are flat next year and could rise to the "double digits" if home prices fall by 5%. Falling home prices could trigger losses not only for investors who bought riskier classes of mortgage-backed securities, but also for some holders of A-rated bonds, according to the report. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Fresh data suggest the U.S. manufacturing sector is beginning to contract, giving new ammunition to those who view the Federal Reserve's upbeat economic outlook as overly optimistic.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management, an Arizona-based group of corporate purchasing managers, Friday said its index of manufacturing activity slid to 49.5 in November from 51.2 in October. Readings below 50 indicate contraction, and the decline ended a 41-month expansion among manufacturers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"November was a defining month," said Norbert Ore, who oversees the survey and serves as procurement director for paper manufacturer Georgia-Pacific Corp. "Since April we've seen a pretty consistent decline in the growth of manufacturing. Now we've moved into a no-growth position."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If sustained, that lack of growth in manufacturing could spell more trouble for an economy already hurt by a major slump in the housing market. The critical question is how soon these impediments to economic growth -- brought on in large part, by excessive inventories and scaled-back production of cars and houses -- can be brought down.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is much debate among economists on this score, and a big divide between bond-market investors and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke over the next move on interest rates. The bond market is pessimistic about the prospects for near-term economic growth and views inflation as contained. It expects the Fed to lower interest rates early next year in an effort to reignite the economy. Mr. Bernanke has struck a more sanguine note, saying the weakness is primarily confined to the housing market. In a speech last week, he also reiterated the need to stand guard against inflation and suggested that rate cuts are unlikely in the months ahead.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday's data strengthened the gloomy outlook in the bond market and among other pessimists. Bond prices continued to rally, pushing the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note down to 4.437%. Stocks fell on the news, as did the dollar.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Futures-market traders, mulling the prospect of a manufacturing recession and slower economic growth, increased the probability that the Fed would cut interest rates by April to roughly 74% from 51% earlier in the day. And after the ISM report's release, many economists lowered their outlook for economic growth this quarter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists still argue the economy will rebound by mid-2007, as excess inventories of cars and houses ease. They say a competitive labor market and low unemployment rate are helping to lift incomes and provide support for the all-important factor of consumer spending. "The fundamentals are still not bad," said Daniel Jester, an economist with Moody's Economy.com.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fisher Barton Inc., a Wisconsin-based manufacturer of blades for agricultural and lawn and garden equipment, sees good and bad. While revenue this year is up 10% from last year's level, the company expects sales to be flat next year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand "has really gone south this year," due to the weakening housing market and the broader slowdown in economic growth, said company President Dick Wilkey. "It's possible we might have to cut our staff, but it's too early to tell."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another worrisome sign for the economy surfaced Friday in a Commerce Department report on construction spending. According to the report, nonresidential construction fell in October for the second consecutive month, partially affected by a 3.1% drop in private manufacturing construction. Until recently, a surge in commercial construction had helped offset some of the pain caused by the downturn in residential construction.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential construction retreated for the seventh consecutive month. Overall, construction spending fell 1% in October from September, the biggest drop in five years.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of new homes resumed their decline in October, suggesting that the housing sector will continue to restrain U.S. economic growth in the fourth quarter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, new data showed that the U.S. economy was stronger over the summer than previously thought, as businesses accumulated more inventory and international trade was less of a drag on growth. In addition, the government slightly lowered its measure of third-quarter inflation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of single-family homes last month decreased 3.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.004 million units, the Commerce Department said. The median forecast of economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires was for a 2.3% decline.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">September sales climbed 3.7%, revised from a previously estimated 5.3% advance. Sales increased 2.1% in August but fell 9.2% in July.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales last month fell 25.4% from a year earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average price of a new home increased to $309,700 from $297,700 in September and $293,600 in October 2005. The median price rose to $248,500 last month from $218,200 in September and $243,900 in October last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, the National Association of Realtors reported that U.S. sales of previously owned homes rose in October for the first time in eight months, though they were down 11.5% from a year earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventory shrank to 558,000 new homes at the end of October, a seven-month supply at the current sales rate. Some 562,000 homes were for sale at the end of September, a 6.7-month supply.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Commerce Department said gross domestic product grew at a 2.2% annual rate in the third quarter, faster than the previously estimated rate of 1.6%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economic growth has weakened amid the housing slump. The economy grew 2.6% in the second quarter and raced ahead at a 5.6% pace in the first.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government's price index for personal consumption increased 2.4%, lower than the previously estimated 2.5% climb but below the second quarter's 4% rise. The PCE price gauge excluding food and energy increased 2.2% last month, less than the previously estimated 2.3% climb and the second quarter's 2.7% rise.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corporate profits after taxes increased 4.6% to $1.167 trillion in the third quarter from the second. In the second quarter, profits increased 0.3%. Profits surged 31.5% from the third quarter of 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Businesses increased inventories by $58 billion, revised from a $50.7 billion increase. The accumulation of goods added 0.16 percentage point to third-quarter GDP, instead of subtracting 0.1 percentage point, as earlier estimated.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">International trade was less of a restraint on GDP than previously estimated because imports increased just 5.3% instead of the 7.8% advance first believed. U.S. exports rose by 6.3%, revised from a 6.5% increase. As a result, trade reduced GDP by 0.21 percentage point, rather than 0.58 percentage point.  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. Federal Reserve officials and investors increasingly seem to be seeing two different economies when they look at the U.S.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke offered an upbeat assessment of the nation's economy Tuesday, warning that tight labor markets could put more pressure on wages and prices, markets barely reacted. Many investors point to declining housing construction, mixed news on holiday sales and a tame reading on inflation as indications that the economy is weakening. However, Mr. Bernanke's hawkish message suggests rate cuts are unlikely in the months to come.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his first major speech on the economic outlook since his testimony to Congress in July, Mr. Bernanke said the choice before the Fed is whether to raise rates, not whether to cut them. Since June, the central bank has held its target for short-term interest rates steady at 5.25%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Whether further policy action against inflation will be required depends on the incoming data," Mr. Bernanke told the National Italian American Foundation in New York on Tuesday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long-term bond yields, which fell Tuesday morning after news of a surprisingly large drop in durable-goods orders, retraced only a bit of that decline after Mr. Bernanke's speech. Long-term bond yields tend to rise on expectations of stronger growth, higher inflation and higher short-term interest rates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, futures markets still see a high likelihood of a rate cut in the next six months. Long-term bond rates, at 4.51%, remain well below short-term rates, a relationship that in the past has often foreshadowed recession.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For its part, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 14.74 points Tuesday, after falling 158 points in the previous session. The index was higher at 12232.98 in midmorning trading yesterday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Market participants are simply much more pessimistic . . . and, clearly, not easily convinced that the chairman's sanguine outlook is the most likely scenario," said Stephen Stanley, an economist at RBS Greenwich Capital.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether the Fed's optimism or the market's pessimism will prove correct remains to be seen. However, as long as investor pessimism keeps long-term rates, including mortgage rates, low, that provides support to the housing market and makes it less likely the Fed will have to cut rates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday Mr. Bernanke raised the possibility that corporations could absorb higher labor costs without raising prices by reducing their profit margins, which now are relatively wide. But "the more worrisome possibility is that tight product markets might allow firms to pass all, or part of, their higher labor costs through to prices, adding to inflation pressures."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charles Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, reinforced the Fed's hawkish message Tuesday in a speech at the University of Rochester in Rochester, New York. "There remains some risk that policy is not yet firm enough to ensure a return to price stability over a reasonable time horizon," he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists themselves are divided on the outlook for the economy, with some predicting that a housing-led slowdown will intensify and others saying that low unemployment rates and buoyant financial markets will fuel a pickup in economic activity.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent economic data provide ammunition for both pessimists and optimists. The Conference Board, a nonprofit business research group in New York, reported Tuesday that its consumer-confidence index fell to 102.9 this month from 105.1 in October. On the other hand, the National Association of Realtors said sales of previously owned homes in October rose 0.5% from September to an annual rate of 6.24 million, the first monthly rise since February.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since July, the Fed's forecast has been for economic growth to slow to slightly less than its long-term trend rate, taking some of the pressure off existing labor and business capacity. It expects the slowdown, coupled with the indirect effects of the recent decline in energy prices, should nudge core inflation down.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest risk to growth, Mr. Bernanke said, is that "the correction in the housing market could turn out to be more severe and widespread."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the Fed is clearly gaining confidence that housing won't experience a hard landing. While home construction will probably fall further to bring supply back in line with demand, Mr. Bernanke said demand for homes appears to have stabilized, thanks to lower mortgage rates and home prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bernanke's predecessor, Alan Greenspan, made a similar observation Tuesday to another New York audience, saying the worst of the housing adjustment was over. But he added that the decline in prices might yet make consumers feel poor enough to depress their spending.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By Rafael Gerena-Morales </div><div>854 words</div><div>30 November 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales fell in October, suggesting that the housing sector will continue to hamper economic growth in the fourth quarter at a time when business investment is also weakening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of single-family homes declined last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.004 million, down 3.2% from September and 25.4% from a year earlier, the Commerce Department said yesterday. At the same time, the number of new homes on the market climbed to a seven-month supply, based on the current sales rate, up from a 6.7-month supply in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts say the high inventories suggest that builders are likely to curtail new construction in the current quarter, which will further damp economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report underscored the housing slump's toll on the economy. The Commerce Department said yesterday that the nation's economy grew at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 2.2% in the third quarter, up from its initial estimate of 1.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upward revision, which reflected a stronger-than-expected buildup in business inventories and slower-than-expected import growth, cheered investors, helping send the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 90.28 points to 12226.73.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, residential fixed investment -- a component of gross domestic product that reflects the nation's spending on housing -- plunged 18% during the quarter, the sharpest drop in 15 years, shaving 1.16 percentage points off overall growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The drag from housing is going to get bigger," said Brian Bethune, U.S. economist at consulting firm Global Insight, who expects economic growth to slow to between 1.5% and 2% in the fourth quarter. "We're losing steam."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While most economists agree that the economy is cooling in the current quarter, as housing sales and construction activity decline, there is considerable debate about the extent of the slowdown. Earlier this week, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said that growth outside housing and autos remains "solid," and that the Fed is more inclined to raise short-term interest rates than to cut them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That put Mr. Bernanke at odds with bond-market investors, who point to the cooling housing market, moderate consumer-spending gains and a recent report showing that business orders fell sharply in October as signs that the threat of inflation is easing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders, said demand for homes appears to be stabilizing, a point that Mr. Bernanke made in explaining his upbeat view of the economy. Although new-home sales have slipped, Mr. Seiders notes that October's annualized sales rate of 1.004 million units was roughly equal to the 1.005 million average for the three months through September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That suggests the housing market is "stabilizing when you consider the kind of downswings" occurring earlier this year, Mr. Seiders said. He expects new-home sales to level off at an annualized rate of roughly one million units in the fourth quarter and to "gradually improve" in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although housing inventories rose last month, based on the current sales rate, the Commerce Department said that the median sales price of new homes climbed to $248,500, up nearly 14% from September. Mr. Seiders said home builders are showering buyers with sales incentives, such as paying $5,000 toward closing costs or upgrading amenities, which has helped some builders sell homes at high prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve's latest survey of economic conditions, which was released yesterday, suggests that consumer spending is weathering the housing slump. "Despite continued softness in automobile and housing-related sales, most districts reported that consumer spending increased during October and early November," according to the Fed's "beige book," which added that the economy continues to experience "moderate growth." Labor markets remained tight, especially for the high-skilled, and wage growth was "generally moderate," the Fed said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, other readings suggest inflation isn't flaring, despite signs of climbing wages. Excluding food and energy, inflation rose 2.2% in the third quarter, down from 2.7% in the second quarter, according to the personal-consumption expenditures index, the Commerce Department's inflation measure, which it updated yesterday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some economists said core inflation remains a problem, because its current level is above the Fed's perceived comfort zone of 1% to 2%. "It's good to see the inflation numbers down, but it's too early to declare victory," said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors. "While we may have passed the peak in inflation, it doesn't mean we're on a clear, downward slope as far as inflation goes."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Today's Market Forecast]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home Prices Adrift</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With U.S. home prices heading into uncharted territory, it may be time to pitch those housing-market forecasts into the sea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today brings a chance to measure the size of the swells when the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight releases its third-quarter report on home prices. Its index has been better behaved than other measures of home prices. While the National Association of Realtors' gauge of median home prices was down more than 3% in October from a year earlier, Ofheo's measure hasn't started falling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ofheo uses data from mortgage originations to track price changes. Many economists like its accuracy because it tracks price movements on individual homes over time, based on mortgage refinancing and new home purchases. The Realtors' price gauge is a median plucked from a large pool of prices based on home sales. It can be skewed by changes in the composition of that pool. When fewer people buy homes in expensive areas, for example, the median price is skewed lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the second quarter, the Ofheo price index rose 1.2% from the previous quarter, short of the 2.2% first-quarter gain and down sharply from large gains last year. Economists estimate the rate of appreciation slowed more in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's probably just a matter of time before this index starts falling, too. It lags behind the Realtor numbers by a couple of months and can be skewed higher if assessors inflate home values during mortgage refinancing. Economists surveyed by WSJ.com this month looked for Ofheo's index to fall 0.5% in 2007 from 2006 -- the first year-over-year decline in the index's 31 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without historical guidelines, nobody knows exactly how low prices will go, or how the housing market will react. Would-be buyers might decide to jump back in for good deals. But borrowing money to buy something that's losing value could scare them off. That seems especially true of speculators who were in the market solely on the belief that prices would keep rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think the willingness to close the deal might come down if you see prices still deteriorating," says Goldman Sachs chief U.S. economist Jan Hatzius.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing storm, in other words, won't end until prices clearly stabilize. They haven't yet.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales declined 3.2% in October, but the median price increased to $248,500, in contrast to Tuesday's report showing a rise in sales of existing homes but a drop in prices. Meanwhile, the number of homes for sale receded in October, but inventories represented a seven months' supply. Economists offer concerns about inventories, and warn the price increase may be misleading. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--- </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventory levels, particularly of already completed houses, stay uncomfortably high. Ignore the gyrations in the median price and wait for tomorrow's Ofheo house price index for a better, albeit lagging, gauge of house price trends. In contrast to yesterday's small upward surprise on existing home sales, new home sales were weaker than expected. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Richard Iley, BNP Paribas </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--- </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders continue to pare their inventories, but at the slower October sales pace it would still require an uncomfortable seven months to clear the number of unsold homes. The biggest inventory overhangs are in the Northeast and Midwest, so further declines in building activity look likely for those regions. Thirty-five percent of the unsold homes nationwide are completed construction. That's the highest share of unsold homes since January 1997. That is likely to put further pressure on prices and further discourage new production . . . With the high number of unsold new homes, further declines in home-building look likely even if sales stabilize at current levels </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Nomura Economics Research </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--- </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The months' supply of new homes bounced back to 7.0 from 6.7, easily high enough to ensure continued downward pressure on prices. In 2005, supply averaged just 4.4 months. The absolute number of homes on the market has peaked, but that is not enough; homebuilders need to reduce inventory drastically. There is a long, long way to go. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Ian Shepherdson, High Frequency Economics </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--- </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sector has begun to stabilize. The improvement in homebuilder sentiment and increase in mortgage purchase applications in November, along with unseasonably warm weather, tentatively point to a pickup in housing activity this month. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Bear Stearns Economics </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--- </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The October median home price rise seems to be due to less sales of lower priced homes in the month. Sometimes, the regional mix of sales can drive m/m shifts in the median price (sales prices in the Northeast and West are much higher than in the Midwest and South), but this does not appear to have been a large factor in October. In any case, the underlying trend is one of lower prices after the sharp gains seen for many years. Furthermore, it should not be surprising to see prices weaker for new homes than for existing homes, as most owners of an existing home are not forced to sell, and many just pull their homes off the market rather than aggressively lower the selling price. Builders, though, do not have this option, and prices of new homes therefore are more reflective of softer demand than are those for existing homes. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Joshua Shapiro, MFR Inc. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--- </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the recent volatility in home prices is due to shifting sales in different regions of the country . . . The demand for new housing is well past its peak and is now on a retreating trend. Moreover, inventories of unsold new homes remain very high, revealing moderate overbuilding. Finally, home price momentum has slowed significantly. Consequently, housing's contribution to economic growth will be a negative again in the fourth quarter although not as bad as in the third quarter. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Steven Wood, Insight Economics </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--- </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders slashed housing starts by 14.6% in October, but this was insufficient, at reduced sales levels, to have any material impact on the inventory overhang. As a result, we are looking at further housing output reductions in the months ahead, with negative consequences for real growth in the fourth quarter of 2006, and the first quarter of 2007 . . . While house prices rebounded in October, this is more than likely temporary, as builders will be under pressure to roll out more discounts and other incentives to get the stubbornly high inventory numbers to move down. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales in the U.S. climbed for the first time in eight months in October, but home prices continued to fall from year-earlier levels. Meanwhile, declines in consumer confidence and durable-goods orders indicated more slowing ahead for the U.S. economy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home resales rose last month to a 6.24 million annual rate, a 0.5% increase from September's revised 6.21 million, the National Association of Realtors said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home price in October was $221,000, unchanged from a revised September reading but down from $229,000 in October 2005. It was the largest year-to-year decline ever and a record third consecutive decrease, NAR said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer confidence took a surprise drop, declining for a second straight month amid worries about the current state of the U.S. economy and its medium-term prospects. The Conference Board, a private research group, said its index of consumer confidence fell to 102.9 points from a revised 105.1. The November reading was below economists' expectations for 105.8, according to a survey conducted by Dow Jones Newswires.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A tighter labor market and a more guarded short-term outlook have combined to curb consumers' confidence in November," said Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board Consumer Research Center. "Despite this retreat in confidence, the overall level of confidence remains favorable and continues to suggest that the economy will expand throughout the first half of next year."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. durable-goods orders reversed course in October, with weaker demand for airplanes and capital goods producing the biggest decline in six years. Durable-goods orders fell 8.3% last month to a seasonally adjusted $209.97 billion, the Commerce Department said. Durables had jumped 8.7% in September, revised from a previously estimated 8.3% increase. Durables were flat during August and down 2.8% in July.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A key barometer of business-equipment spending -- orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft -- decreased 5.1%, after rising 3.2% in September. Shipments for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft decreased 1.5%, after falling 1.6% in September; the shipments are used in calculating gross domestic product.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales in the U.S. climbed for the first time in eight months in October, but home prices continued to fall from year-earlier levels. Meanwhile, declines in consumer confidence and durable-goods orders indicated more slowing ahead for the U.S. economy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home resales rose last month to a 6.24 million annual rate, a 0.5% increase from September's revised 6.21 million, the National Association of Realtors said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home price in October was $221,000, unchanged from a revised September reading but down from $229,000 in October 2005. It was the largest year-to-year decline ever and a record third consecutive decrease, NAR said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer confidence took a surprise drop. The Conference Board, a private research group, said its index of consumer confidence fell to 102.9 points from a revised 105.1.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. durable-goods orders fell 8.3% last month to a seasonally adjusted $209.97 billion, the Commerce Department said.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By Greg Ip in Washington and Rafael Gerena-Morales and Michael Corkery in New York </div><div>1392 words</div><div>29 November 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a contrast with the widely held view on Wall Street that slower economic growth will lead to interest-rate cuts, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke offered an upbeat assessment of the nation's economy, warning that tight labor markets could put more pressure on wages and prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many investors point to declining housing construction, mixed news on holiday sales and a tame reading on inflation as indications that the economy is weakening, inflation risks are fading and that the next move by the Fed will be to cut interest rates, perhaps as soon as next spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Mr. Bernanke's hawkish message suggests rate cuts are unlikely in the months to come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his first major speech on the economic outlook since his testimony to Congress in July, Mr. Bernanke said growth outside of housing and autos remains "solid," underlying inflation "uncomfortably high" and that the choice before the Fed is whether to raise rates, not whether to cut them. Since June, the central bank has held its target for short-term interest rates steady at 5.25%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A failure of inflation to moderate as expected would be especially troublesome," Mr. Bernanke told the National Italian American Foundation in New York yesterday. "Whether further policy action against inflation will be required depends on the incoming data."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stock and bond markets barely reacted -- underscoring how, in recent months, Fed officials and investors increasingly have seemed to be looking at two different economies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 14.74 points yesterday to 12136.45, after falling 158 points in the previous session.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long-term bond yields, which fell yesterday morning on news of a surprisingly large drop in durable goods orders, retraced only a bit of that decline after Mr. Bernanke's speech. Long-term bond yields tend to rise on expectations of stronger growth, higher inflation and higher short-term interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, futures markets still see a high likelihood of a rate cut in the next six months. Long-term bond rates, at 4.51%, remain well below short-term rates, a relationship that in the past has often foreshadowed recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Market participants are simply much more pessimistic . . . and, clearly, not easily convinced that the chairman's sanguine outlook is the most likely scenario," said Stephen Stanley, an economist at RBS Greenwich Capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether the Fed's optimism or the market's pessimism will prove correct remains to be seen. However, as long as investor pessimism keeps long-term rates, including mortgage rates low, that provides support to the housing market and makes it less likely the Fed will have to cut rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday, Mr. Bernanke spotlighted the labor market as a potential source of inflation pressure. "It seems clear that labor costs . . . have been rising more quickly of late. Some part of this acceleration no doubt reflects the current tightness in labor markets," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unemployment rate fell to 4.4% in October, well below the 4.75% to 5% range Fed officials had projected in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bernanke raised the possibility that corporations could absorb higher labor costs without raising prices by reducing their profit margins, which now are relatively wide. But "the more worrisome possibility is that tight product markets might allow firms to pass all, or part of, their higher labor costs through to prices, adding to inflation pressures."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charles Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, reinforced the Fed's hawkish message yesterday in a speech at the University of Rochester in Rochester, N.Y. "There remains some risk that policy is not yet firm enough to ensure a return to price stability over a reasonable time horizon," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists themselves are divided on the outlook for the economy, with some predicting that a housing-led slowdown will intensify and others saying that low unemployment rates and buoyant financial markets will fuel a pickup in economic activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economic data released yesterday provided ammunition for both sides. In October, orders for durable goods -- big-ticket items, such as machine tools and dishwashers, designed to last three or more years -- fell 8.3% from September, fueled by a steep drop in commercial airplane orders, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for capital goods, excluding defense and aircraft products -- a barometer of business spending -- fell 5.1%, the first decrease in six months. That was led by a 25.6% plunge in orders for computers and related products. Economic consulting firm Global Insight attributed most of that drop to Microsoft Corp.'s planned launch of a new operating system next year, which is causing some potential buyers to delay purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stuart Hoffman, chief economist of PNC Financial Services Group Inc., said the latest data suggest that capital spending "won't provide as big of a cushion" as expected for an economy that is being undercut by a struggling housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Conference Board, a nonprofit business research group in New York, reported that its consumer confidence index fell to 102.9 this month from 105.1 in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the positive side, the National Association of Realtors said sales of previously owned homes in October rose 0.5% from September to an annual rate of 6.24 million, the first monthly rise since February. But the median home price fell to $221,000, down 3.5% from a year earlier. That was probably the largest such drop since World War II, said David Lereah, NAR's chief economist. However, the latest decline followed an unprecedented multiyear run-up in prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lereah said sellers in many markets have been cutting prices and those reductions, coupled with relatively low mortgage rates, have helped spur more sales. He attributed part of the decline in median prices to the fact the homes in lower-priced markets like Texas accounted for a larger share of sales than a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While buyers are creeping back into the market, the inventory of homes for sale rose 1.9% in October to 3.85 million, or a 7.4-month supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since July, the Fed's forecast has been for economic growth to slow to slightly less than its long-term trend rate, taking some of the pressure off existing labor and business capacity. It expects the slowdown, coupled with the indirect effects of the recent decline in energy prices, should nudge core inflation down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bernanke said yesterday that the economy was broadly following that forecast. "Outside of the housing and motor-vehicle sectors, economic activity has, on balance, been expanding at a solid pace," he said. Trends in core inflation, which excludes food and energy, are less worrisome than in the spring, though at 2.7% in October, the rate "remains uncomfortably high."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest risk to growth, Mr. Bernanke said, is that "the correction in the housing market could turn out to be more severe and widespread."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The rate of home-price appreciation has slowed significantly," and the overhang of unsold homes is likely even larger than official figures show, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the Fed is clearly gaining confidence that housing won't experience a hard landing. While home construction will probably fall further to bring supply back in line with demand, Mr. Bernanke said demand for homes appears to have stabilized, thanks to lower mortgage rates and home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bernanke's predecessor, Alan Greenspan, made a similar observation yesterday to another New York audience, saying the worst of the housing adjustment was over. But he added that the decline in prices might yet make consumers feel poor enough to depress their spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bernanke said there is "little evidence" that a weak housing market is "spilling over more broadly to consumer spending or aggregate employment." As long as that remains true, he said, growth could reaccelerate in such a way that the economy starts to overheat, generating inflation pressure.</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>845 words</div><div>29 November 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a weak housing market nudges the foreclosure rate higher, next year is looking promising for investors in distressed real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the U.S. housing slump hasn't produced a bonanza for such investors, but lenders stuck with foreclosed property are becoming more inclined to slash prices or sell properties through auctions, industry experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're all going to have to be more creative in the next 12 to 24 months" in selling foreclosed homes, says Chad Neel, president and chief operating officer of Fidelity National Asset Management Solutions, a unit of Fidelity National Information Services Inc., Jacksonville, Fla. Mr. Neel's company helps lenders manage and sell foreclosed homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Williams &amp;Williams Inc., a Tulsa-based auctioneer, says its sales of foreclosed homes will nearly double this year to about 5,060. Dean Williams, chief executive of the auction firm, expects another near doubling of sales in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dallas-based Hudson &amp;Marshall Inc. expects its auction sales of foreclosed properties to total about 4,800 this year, up 23% from 2005. David Webb, co-owner of the auction company, believes sales will rise at least 20% in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The auction firms say their busiest auction markets recently have included Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Texas and Colorado. "Word on the street is that California, Florida and Arizona will also be very active in the next 12 months," Mr. Webb says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders refer to foreclosed homes as REO, short for "real-estate owned." They generally try to sell REO homes as quickly as possible to minimize holding costs, such as those for insurance, taxes and lawn care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first half of 2006, REO properties accounted for 3.1% of all U.S. home sales, up from 2.4% two years earlier, according to a study by First American Real Estate Solutions, a unit of First American Corp., Santa Ana, Calif. The study found that those homes sold at a median discount of 14% to their estimated value in the first half, compared with 12.5% two years before. The discounts reflect the gap between the actual sale price for the homes and the value estimated by a computer model, which takes into account sales of comparable homes nearby and price trends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has taken a while for foreclosures to mount. The housing boom of recent years reduced foreclosure rates because most people who fell behind on their loans could refinance or quickly sell their homes for at least enough to pay off the loans. At the end of this year's second quarter, only about 1% of all home mortgage loans outstanding were in the foreclosure process, down from an average of 1.2% over the past decade, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Doug Duncan, chief economist for the mortgage bankers, expects a modest rise in foreclosures over the next year or two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People with weak credit records who have taken out loans over the past year are falling behind on payments at a rapid clip, according to a recent report by mortgage analysts at UBS AG in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christopher Cagan, director of research and analytics at First American Real Estate Solutions, notes that REO sales are a lagging indicator of the housing market because at least a few months elapse between a borrower's default and the foreclosure. Dr. Cagan expects a modestly higher foreclosure rate and deeper discounts next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discounts are likely to be larger in areas where inventories of unsold homes have soared, such as in parts of Arizona and Florida, Dr. Cagan says. Another big factor in determining demand for REO homes is local job and population growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Los Angeles County, which has strong housing demand and an extreme shortage of space, the median discount on REO homes was just 1.7% in this year's first half. In Ohio's Cuyahoga County, where job losses have left a glut of empty homes, the discount was about 30%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most REO homes are listed by real-estate brokers and sold like ordinary houses. But lenders often turn to auctions when they see their REO inventories piling up. Lenders that choose the auction route want to get "current market value, whatever it is, rather than sit on vacant property and speculate as to if or when it might sell," says Mr. Williams of the Tulsa-based auctioneer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One recent buyer at a Hudson &amp;Marshall auction was Warren Russell, who bought a 1,300-square-foot home in Detroit for just $1,500. Mr. Russell says the home is structurally sound but needs new windows, paint and some other items. He expects to spend about $10,000 renovating the home and then rent it out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In considering purchases of foreclosed homes, Mr. Russell says, "you can't think, 'Would I live here?' There are people at every level of income that need a roof." </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes in the U.S. unexpectedly increased to a 6.24 million annual rate by 0.5% in October, the first rise in eight months, the National Association of Realtors said. However, home prices marked a record drop. The median home price was $221,000 in October, compared with a revised $221,000 in September and $229,000 in October 2005. It was the largest year-to-year decline ever and a record third consecutive decrease, NAR said. Economists weigh in on the report, and what it means for the future of the housing market. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--- </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the modest pick up in sales, inventories are continuing to rise, from 3.783 million units for sale in September to 3.854 million units on the market in October. As a result, inventories measured in terms of numbers of months supply continues to grind higher, rising to 7.4 months, its highest level for over 13 years. The problems in the condo/co-op market are particularly acute . . . With the inventory levels still rising, downward pressure on prices will continue to build. Overall, a full reading of this report suggests that it remains foolhardy in the extreme to argue that the housing market is bottoming out. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Richard Iley, BNP Paribas </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--- </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although home resale prices are down for the third month in a row on a year-over-year basis (we still await Thursday's reading from Ofheo for a more accurate reading on home prices), home sales were stronger than expected in October and were revised higher for September. As with new home sales, the pace of decline in housing market transactions appears to have slowed in the last three months. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Bear Stearns Economics </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--- </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only a sharp increase in the West kept the [home-sales] numbers up. In the Northeast and South, demand continued to falter. The weakest portion of the market is the condo market, which dropped again. There was a pick up in single-family houses that managed to offset that drop. But the real problem is the huge level of inventories. Condo inventories rose sharply again and now represent over nine months of supply given current sales rates. Single-family home supplies also rose and are in excess of seven months. As for prices, they continue to go downhill and with the number of homes still on the market, it would be surprising if prices don't continue to drop. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Naroff Economic Advisors </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--- </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The year-to-year declines . . . should be viewed in the context of the 111% leap in the median single family home price that occurred from early 1995 through this summer, and therefore it should not be a huge shock that we are seeing a price correction. Moreover, while certainly a change in trend, so far these data are not corroborating some of the more alarmist stories being bandied about recently (although the most recent data are for deals agreed to about two months ago, so price trends since then could be worse). </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Joshua Shapiro, MFR Inc. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--- </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales peaked during the summer of 2005 and have been trending lower even since then. These declines have been driven by a collapse of speculative buying. Slower sales have kept inventories of unsold homes at very high levels. In turn, this has pressured prices, which are now falling. Further declines are anticipated. As home equity stagnates or falls, homeowners will have less home equity (growth) to tap into to support consumer spending. Housing's contribution to economic growth peaked last year and is now subtracting from overall economic activity. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Steven Wood, Insight Economics </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--- </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This measure of home prices is unreliable. While there is no doubt that certain markets will experience price drops, the National Association of Realtors' third quarter data indicated that while 45 metro areas posted a year-over-year decline from July to September, 102 areas posted increases, with 21 recording double-digit gains. In any case, a more accurate read on home prices will be available with the release of Ofheo's home price index for the third quarter. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Omair Sharif, RBS Greenwich Capital </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--- </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We do not believe that housing has yet hit bottom, but the steepest declines are probably behind us. The inventory overhang remains troubling, at 7.4 months of supply. Some sellers will have to accept lower prices, while others will refuse to do so and will take their homes off the market, to ease the overhang. </p>

</div><div class="author">By Matthew Heimer  </div><div>685 words</div><div>26 November 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Sunday</div><div>SNJR</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After hurtling along for years, the nationwide real-estate boom has come to a screeching halt. In 2005, home prices in the U.S. rose more than 12%; this year, the National Association of Realtors expects appreciation to reach just 1.9% -- the lowest gain since 1992.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising mortgage rates and selloffs by skittish real-estate investors have helped depress housing prices in many metropolitan areas. But there's another factor that many observers miss: the relationship between home prices and incomes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the cost of housing in a given area grows far faster than local wages and salaries, the pool of potential buyers shrinks, and prices are much more likely to sink.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the past five years, SmartMoney magazine has workd with Ingo Winzer, president of the consulting firm Local Market Monitor, evaluating home-sale prices against local income to determine whether a given market is overvalued, undervalued or fairly valued. Mr. Winzer relies on more than 15 years of housing and income statistics to find out where prices are headed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Mr. Winzer, any market that's more than 30% overvalued is due for a correction. In the fall of 2003, only eight markets on the list of 152 fit that description; on this year's list, 37 did. Sure enough, price decreases are beginning to pop up in many of the markets that have shown up year after year as the most overvalued -- especially in Florida and California.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What to do if you're in a falling market? Obviously, that's a promising climate for a bargain-hunting buyer. A savvy real-estate agent can help you craft a bid that's low enough to save you money, but realistic enough to be accepted. When one of Frank Borges LLosa's clients finds an appealing home, the Northern Virginia broker searches the history of the selling agent -- data not available to consumers -- on the local multiple listing service. If the agent frequently sells below the asking price, Mr. LLosa knows he can be aggressive.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Listing archives can also help buyers figure out the right bidding range. Ask your agent to comb the MLS for "pending sales," deals that are in contract but haven't yet closed, to get an up-to-date sense of price ranges in your market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an ideal world, you wouldn't sell a house at all while prices were falling. But if you must, experts agree that it's best to act quickly, before prices slide further.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Often, that means gritting your teeth and offering the best price to get potential buyers in the door. Here again, getting your agent to tap pending-sales data can pay off. Pay attention to the pricing per square foot for homes similar to yours, and set your asking price at the bottom of, or even below, that range.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">South Florida broker Mike Morgan recommends that his clients take 1% to 3% off the price every week until they get an offer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another way to motivate a potential buyer: Motivate his broker. In a typical sale, a commission of 6% is split evenly between the buyer's and seller's agents. But you can ask that a higher percentage go to the buyer's agent, or even offer extra money out of your own pocket, so that she'll steer customers your way.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Lereah, chief economist of the National Association of Realtors, expects that nationwide prices will bounce back in 2007.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He adds that one-third of the country is primed for growth -- a claim that Mr. Winzer's research supports. And if you don't have to sell your home, the short-term turmoil underscores the point that it seldom makes sense to obsess over your home's value the way you'd obsess over, say, your Google shares. Better to sit back, enjoy your mortgage-interest tax deduction, and wait for better days.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By Mark Whitehouse and Michael Corkery  </div><div>225 words</div><div>20 November 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of new homes in the U.S. slid to a six-year low in October, a sharper-than-expected drop that prompted some forecasters to revise downward their estimates of economic growth. On a more positive note, however, the drop in starts could help to stabilize a housing market suffering from a glut of supply.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said home builders started construction on new houses at a seasonally adjusted, annualized rate of 1.486 million in October, down 14.6% from September and the slowest pace since July 2000. Also, data for September and August were revised downward.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists noted that the monthly housing-start numbers tend to be volatile and subject to revision.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of new homes in the U.S. slid to a six-year low in October, a sharper-than-expected drop that prompted some forecasters to revise downward their estimates of economic growth. On a more positive note, however, the drop in starts could help to stabilize a housing market suffering from a glut of supply.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said home builders started construction on new houses at a seasonally adjusted, annualized rate of 1.486 million in October, down 14.6% from September and the slowest pace since July 2000. Also, data for September and August were revised downward.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists noted that the monthly housing-start numbers tend to be volatile and subject to revision. Still, the report led many to cut their estimates for economic growth in the current quarter, on concerns that construction activity could decline more sharply than previously thought -- meaning that areas such as business investment, exports and consumer spending will have to grow faster to keep the economy afloat.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Today's report puts the burden on other sectors of the economy to give us the type of growth we expected before, because housing is going to be more of a drag than we thought," said Ben Herzon, senior economist at St. Louis consultancy Macroeconomic Advisers, which cut to 2.2% from 2.6% its estimate of annualized fourth-quarter growth in real gross domestic product -- a broad measure of economic activity, adjusted for inflation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morgan Stanley economists revised their estimates of fourth-quarter GDP growth to 2.9% from 3%. David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities, cut his forecast to 2.5% from 2.8%. Mr. Resler said he could justify an even larger cut "unless starts bounce back a lot." Nigel Gault at Global Insight said the firm's forecast remains at 2.2% and won't change until the beginning of December.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline in housing starts also can be seen as a sign that the market is doing its job by reducing a big overhang of unsold houses.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The correction could take some time to play out. Encouraged by the recent housing boom, builders have put up many more homes than people are willing to buy.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A major factor driving up the supply of unsold homes is buyers getting cold feet and canceling contracts for new homes, often at the last minute. D.R. Horton Inc., one of the nation's largest home builders by number of units, says its cancellation rate had increased in the fourth quarter to 40%, from 29% in the third quarter and 23% in the second quarter, and up from a historic rate of 16% to 20%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To get rid of the glut, builders are doing two things: slashing prices and building fewer new homes. As of September, the median price of a new home stood at $217,100, down 9.7% from a year earlier, according to the Commerce Department. And in a sign of a continued slowdown in construction activity, building permits for new houses fell 6.3% in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The depth of previous downturns suggests that construction may have yet to hit bottom. In October, starts of single-family homes were down 32% from a year earlier, compared with 45% in January 1991 and 52% in March 1980.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We could see further declines still," said Daniel Oppenheim, housing analyst at Banc of America Securities. "In talking to the builders, I get the sense there's probably going to be a real push in the remainder of this year and the beginning of next year to resist any new construction."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">D.R. Horton reported earlier this past week that it had reduced its total number of homes under construction to roughly 29,000 homes, about a 27% drop from 40,000 homes at June 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luxury builder Toll Brothers Inc. reported its highest number of cancellations in company history: about 7%, which is up from 2% a year earlier.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Today's Market Forecast]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">False Bottom?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors sniffing for a bottom in the housing market need to be careful where they put their noses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-building stocks have run up over the past four months. Since hitting a low in July, the Dow Jones index of home-building stocks has risen 23%. (It's still 39% below its July 2005 high.) Amid recent signs that the housing market has begun to stabilize, investors will be looking to today's report on housing starts and building permits from the Commerce Department for confirmation that the bottom is really in place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a dangerous game. Signs that the housing market is coming out of its decline are tentative at best. Yesterday, the National Association of Homebuilders reported that for November its measure of builders' assessment of the market, while still low, rose for the second month in a row. In its most recent survey of consumers, the University of Michigan saw a sharp swing higher in the number of respondents who said that now is a good time to buy a house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other side of the ledger, lumber prices are at their lowest level in nearly four years. Masco, a building-supply company that works with builders across the country, has said it expects new construction will be started on 12% fewer houses in 2007 than this year, matching its forecast decline for this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires estimate that today's report will show that housing starts slipped by 5.6% in October. But they expect that building permits, which haven't had an up month since they started crashing lower in February, nudged 0.1% higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lehman Brothers economist Ethan Harris thinks that housing sales really are beginning to stabilize. But given the large number of homes on the market, many of them empty, the worst may still not be over for building activity. And if prices keep falling, sales could continue to suffer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meantime, Bollinger Capital Management head John Bollinger has a proverb worth keeping in mind -- that there is a small god of the trading pit who will allow you to pick the top once, pick the bottom once, and be wrong as often as you choose.</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>331 words</div><div>15 November 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D5</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of homes for sale in major metropolitan areas declined modestly in October, a positive sign for sellers, new data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes offered for sale on multiple-listing services in 18 major metro areas was down 1.2% in October from September's tally, according to data compiled by ZipRealty Inc., a real-estate brokerage company based in Emeryville, Calif. Those metro areas account for nearly a fifth of homes listed for sale nationwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though inventories remain far above year-earlier levels, the decline during October suggests the market is starting to whittle down a surplus of homes that has weighed on prices over the past year or so. Another factor reducing inventories is that some sellers are taking homes off the market because they can't obtain what they consider an acceptable price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ZipRealty's data show that the sharpest declines in home inventories in October were in the metro areas of Sacramento, Calif. (down 5.4% from a month before), San Diego (5.6%) and San Francisco (6.4%). Inventories rose 2.4% in the Seattle area and 3.7% in the Miami area, however. New condominiums have flooded the market in south Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices have declined recently in many areas of the country, including parts of California, Arizona, Nevada, Florida, Massachusetts and the Washington, D.C., area. Richard DeKaser, chief economist at National City Corp., a banking company based in Cleveland, says recent data on home inventories and mortgage applications suggest that home prices will be flat to slightly lower next year before starting a modest recovery in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a conference call with analysts yesterday, Donald Tomnitz, chief executive officer of D.R. Horton Inc., a big Fort Worth, Texas-based home builder, cautioned against expectations that the market will quickly rebound. "We're in the early stages of a declining market," he said. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE RECENT SOFTENING in the U.S. real-estate market after years of double-digit percentage home-price appreciation may make it scarier than ever to buy a vacation home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With prices in some areas falling, buyers may wonder whether a purchase will hold its value. Also, high prices have pushed the dream of owning a second home out of reach for many people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RealEstateJournal.com, a Wall Street Journal Web site, found a number of locales across the U.S. where median prices rose at a pace below the national average of 84% for the 10-year period between the second quarters of 1996 and 2006 and that have above-average employment outlooks, according to data from Economy.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After crunching the numbers with Mike Sklarz, head of global research for New City Corp., Tokyo, RealEstateJournal.com investigated the areas further, looking at things like the availability and selection of vacation residences, and proximity to recreational and cultural offerings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 12 locales are: Bath/Beaufort County, N.C.; Blairsville, Ga.; Clarksville, Va.; Cloudcroft, N.M.; Dadeville, Ala.; Driggs, Idaho; Eureka Springs, Ark.; Heber City, Utah; Helen, Ga.; Jemez Springs, N.M.; South Padre Island, Texas; Steamboat Springs, Colo.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Driggs, Idaho. A home just outside town with a view of the Teton Mountain range for $699,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Driggs serves as a commuter town to Jackson Hole, Wyo., where the average home price is $1 million. The average price in Driggs is $306,600 this year, up 22% from last, according to John Hanlon, president of the Teton Board of Realtors. Rental rates range from $100 to $475 a night, according to Liz Pitcher, owner of Grand Valley Lodging in Driggs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Blairsville, Ga. A local mountainview residence for $298,700.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blairsville, situated in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains and surrounded by forest, offers cabins for rent and sale for vacationers interested in outdoor activities. A 1,500-square-foot cabin goes for about $200,000, those with views between $300,000 and $400,000, Chuck Albury, a Realtor with Mountain Realty in Young Harris, Ga., says. Homes on the nearby lakes start at around $800,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Steamboat Springs, Colo. A home near the ski-base area for $799,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once primarily a ranching town, Steamboat Springs goes by the nickname "Ski Town U.S.A." Ski-in, ski-out condos start at $350,000 and go into the millions; two-bedroom condos at least a quarter of a mile from the ski base start at around $200,000, says broker Ray Wright of Steamboat Village Brokers.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clarksville is the only town on Buggs Island/Kerr Lake, which offers opportunities for boating and fishing, and, with more than 800 miles of shoreline, is rarely crowded. Lake homes begin at $350,000 and can go above $1 million, while properties not on the water start at $150,000, Bill Baker, broker-owner of United Country Virginia Realty, says.

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Houston Missed the Real-Estate Boom of East and West Coasts, but Now It's Payback Time</span>
</div><div class="author">By Thaddeus Herrick </div><div>959 words</div><div>6 November 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houston -- THIS SPRAWLING CITY missed the real-estate boom that sent home prices soaring on the East and West coasts. Now, with much of the nation's housing market in retreat, it has yet to feel even a tremor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September, local sales of single-family homes and condominiums were up 17.7% from a year earlier, logging their 32nd straight month of increase, according to the Houston Association of Realtors. The median price of an existing single-family home: $143,400, up 3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, nationwide sales of residential real estate fell 14.2% in September, according to the National Association of Realtors. Home prices nationally were down 2.2%, retreating in such former hot spots such as Washington, Boston and San Francisco. The national median sales price for September for existing single-family homes was $219,800, according to the Houston Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houston's gains are nothing like those seen in the past decade in the Northeast and California, but that may be the secret to Houston's success and the reason a bubble is unlikely to develop here. Land here is abundant, and the city has some of the least-restrictive land-use and construction rules in the nation. Those factors help supply to keep pace with demand and keep prices within reach of a broad range of potential buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We haven't had a bad year in the past decade," says Lorraine Abercrombie, chairwoman of the local Realtors group and marketing director for Greenwood King Properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houston's model is in stark contrast to cities such as Boston and San Francisco, which have strict zoning, exacting building codes and laws governing historical preservation. Some economists, including Edward Glaeser of Harvard University, say excessive regulation in such cities has slowed construction to the point where demand has outstripped supply, fueling a run-up in home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the once-sizzling markets where home prices are falling, housing costs are double, triple or even quadruple those of Houston. The danger, says Dr. Glaeser, is such places have priced out today's highly skilled "knowledge workers," forcing them to live in a more affordable locale where their contribution to the economy might not be as great. "These are places where only the elite can live," Dr. Glaeser says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not so Houston. Confined by neither oceans nor mountains, the Houston metropolitan area has plenty of room to spread out. What is more, the city has no zoning, weak historical-preservation rules and few tools to preserve open space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result is unfettered growth. For that, too, there is a price to be paid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houston lacks the historical charm of a city such as Boston and the natural beauty of a place such as San Francisco. In recent years an increasing number of Houston residents have warned that the city's affinity for strip malls, freeways and endless subdivisions may be putting it at a disadvantage in attracting talented workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EVEN SO, HOUSTON'S economy is humming, thanks in part to a sustained boom in oil and gas and the city's burgeoning medical industry, which attracts patients from all over the world. In addition, the Hurricane Katrina evacuation in 2005 brought tens of thousands of refugees here, pushing up retail sales and lowering apartment-vacancy rates. Most of the Katrina refugees weren't wealthy enough to buy homes, however.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Houston metropolitan area has added 420,000 jobs since 1995, according to the Greater Houston Partnership while the 10-county metropolitan statistical area topped 5.2 million people in July 2005, up about 11% from the 2000 Census count, according to the Texas State Data Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affordable housing has played a significant role. James Gaines, an economist at the Texas A&amp;M University's Real Estate Center, says a Houston developer can be "cutting roads and building houses" within a year of buying 500 acres. The same project would take a developer in Florida three years and as many as eight years in California, substantially pushing up the price, says Dr. Gaines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Houston Association of Realtors reported total property sales -- everything from single-family homes to country homes to lots listed on the Multiple Listing Service -- numbered 7,163 in September, up 17.8% from a year earlier. Sales of new and existing single family homes were up 19.3% to 5,954. The pace of home sales is also picking up. The trade group says the area has a 5.5-month supply of unsold homes, down slightly from August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national outlook isn't so bright, with some economists forecasting that sales of new homes are unlikely to start rising again before early 2008. A joint survey by consulting firm Global Insight and Cleveland bank holding company National City Corp. showed that 67 metropolitan areas experienced price declines in the second quarter this year, and not just those that enjoyed the boom. The Midwest, for example, showed the highest concentration of falling prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey also showed slower home-price increases nationally in the past year, with the most rapid slowdown coming in high-price markets such as California, Florida and the Northeast corridor. Nearly 70% of the 317 metropolitan areas surveyed showed a decline in appreciation during the period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Texas had six markets where home prices rose at a rate of between 6% and 12% and another nine markets where prices increased 12% or more, the survey showed. Richard J. Dekaser, chief economist for National City, says, "It's like revenge of the nerds." </p>

</div><div class="author">By June Fletcher and Ruth Simon </div><div>2052 words</div><div>3 November 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>W1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A LITTLE OVER a year ago, buyers couldn't wait to sign contracts to purchase homes. Now, many can't wait to get out of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With real-estate prices falling around the country and even pro-industry trade groups predicting further declines over the next year, buyers are backing away from deals in droves. At a semiannual housing forecast conference last week in Washington, D.C., economists reported that contract-cancellation rates for big builders were running around 40% -- about twice as high as last year's levels. Anecdotally, real-estate professionals say they are seeing a similar dynamic in existing-home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the cancellations are by people who signed new-home contracts at one price months ago, haven't yet closed, and are now stunned to see the builder drastically cutting prices on identical properties. Some are by speculators caught short by other investments they can't unload. And some are by people trapped in a chain reaction: They can't sell their old home -- or the buyer has canceled the contract -- so they are being forced to cancel the deal on a new house they are buying somewhere else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are a whole lot of people running from contracts," says Alexandria, Va., real-estate attorney Beau Brincefield. He is currently representing more than 50 buyers who are seeking to get out of contracts on single-family homes, townhouses and condos, compared with none a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though it may mean losing a deposit that could run tens of thousands of dollars -- deposits typically range from 1% to 5% of the purchase price -- many buyers are deciding that is less onerous than the alternative. With median new-home prices already 9.7% below last year's levels, according to the U.S. Commerce Department, bailing out now may be less painful than committing to an expensive, and possibly depreciating, investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a far cry from the home-flipping exuberance of the past few years, when rising home values fueled a buy-and-sell mentality among millions of homeowners, and trading up became a staple of reality TV and home-improvement shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home builders are taking a big hit from record numbers of contract cancellations, or "kickouts." Fort Worth, Texas-based D.R. Horton Inc., the nation's biggest developer, says its cancellation rate is currently 40%, compared with 29% a year ago. Meritage Homes Corp., in Scottsdale, Ariz., is reporting a 37% kickout rate, compared with 21% a year ago. And Standard Pacific Corp. says that 50% of its contracts fell through in the third quarter of this year, compared with 18% for the same period last year. The Irvine, Calif.-based developer built 11,400 homes across the country last year. Among its current projects: Glenmeadow, a gated community in Simi Valley, Calif., where three- and four-bedroom homes range from $1.1 million to $1.3 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cancellations by buyers of existing homes are up as well. Although no formal measures exist, historically they have been in the 2% range, according to the National Association of Realtors. In September, however, nearly half of the 454 agents responding to an online NAR survey said they had recently experienced cancellation rates higher than that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sean Shallis, senior real-estate strategist for the Shallis Team of Re/Max Villa Realtors in Jersey City, N.J., says that roughly 22% of his sales have fallen apart before closing this year because the buyers backed out, up from 10% last year. With the market cooling, buyers have decided they can buy a similar property for less. For others, adjustable-rate mortgages have gotten more expensive, making a home purchase too costly, Mr. Shallis says. To reduce the chances of cancellation, he is advising his clients to close their deals as quickly as possible after the offer is accepted, and to put fewer contingencies in the contract. "The longer your property is under contract, the longer the buyer has to talk and think about it and watch the market change."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shallis himself is among the would-be buyers with cold feet. Late last year, he agreed to pay $595,000 for a new two-bedroom condominium in Jersey City for his in-laws. He pulled the plug on the deal this summer after his father-in-law's illness scotched the planned move. "My exit strategy was if they didn't move into it, we could sell it or rent it," Mr. Shallis says. But that plan made less sense after the price of similar properties dropped to as low as $529,000. At the same time, higher short-term interest rates made it unlikely that he would be able to cover his mortgage payments and other costs if he found a renter. Instead, Mr. Shallis walked away from the contract and lost his $30,000 deposit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sinking home appraisal quashed the deal for retirees Denis and Michael Budge. The couple put their two-bedroom house in Carson City, Nev., on the market a little more than a year ago at $495,000, so they could move to another home they had already bought in Waldport, Ore. After some nail-biting months with few showings and no offers, they finally landed a buyer, who signed a contract in June for $425,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But during the escrow period, as prices in their area continued to slide, the appraisal came in -- at $395,000. The Budges were still willing to sell, even at that greatly reduced price, but the buyer backed out the day before the closing. (Through his agent, he declined to comment.) The Budges pocketed the $1,000 deposit, of course, but now they are stuck with two mortgages -- a hardship on their fixed incomes. "We thought we were going to relax and enjoy our retirement," says Ms. Budge. "Not any more."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kickouts were high nationwide in the late '80s, and in California and New England in the early '90s, spurred by massive job losses. But until now there's never been a period where cancellations have spiked in the absence of a recession, according to Amy Crews Cutts, deputy chief economist at Freddie Mac. Ms. Cutts says the current jitters are largely a result of investors fleeing the housing market in the last few months, which "slammed [it] into reverse," and consumers' fears that the bubble had burst. Rising interest rates earlier this year also gave buyers who hadn't yet closed on their homes cold feet. The result: a huge backlog of unsold homes, which could further depress prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But mortgage rates have fallen recently, and if they stay below 6.5%, Ms. Cutts expects that buyers will regain their confidence by late spring, causing cancellations to ease up. Vienna, Va., housing economist Thomas Lawler agrees, but says builders must continue to cut their production and sell off their inventory so supply and demand can get back in balance. "Builders need to take a bullet," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyer's remorse does have legal consequences, but the laws vary from state to state and depend on how the purchase contract was written. Usually, a buyer who defaults will have to give up the "good faith" or "earnest money" deposit that was made when the contract was accepted. But typically there is also some wiggle room written into contracts that allows buyers to cancel without penalty -- for instance, if they can't get financing, if the home inspection uncovers defects that the seller won't correct, or if the seller doesn't make certain disclosures. Just changing your mind, however, isn't a valid excuse to cancel. A court could find that a buyer who got cold feet is in breach of contract and liable for the seller's expenses, plus damages -- or could even force the sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, it is better not to wind up in court. To keep deals from falling apart, builders are offering everything from free vacations and cars to help with closing costs and mortgage-rate buy-downs -- and they are cutting prices, too. "They're hungry," says Gopal Ahluwalia, director of research at the National Association of Home Builders, the organization that sponsored last week's forecast conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of these incentives are dangled to attract new customers. But as the market has cooled and kickout rates have risen, nervous builders have also been quietly sweetening the pot for buyers they have already snagged but whose contracts haven't yet closed -- just to keep them from bailing out of the deal. Some are even offering to drop the selling price after contracts have been signed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years ago, Rosemary and Paul Owen, both federal employees, signed a $350,000 contract on a three-bedroom condo in Cape Canaveral, Fla., that was yet to be built. Since they knew it would take a long time for the building to be completed -- and the housing market was rapidly rising -- they took their time getting their old house in West Melbourne, Fla., ready for sale. By the time they were ready to sell their three-bedroom home this January, buyers weren't biting. Though they lowered their asking price to $359,000 from $439,000, only 18 people looked at their home over a 10-month period, and no one made an offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So they went to the builder in Cape Canaveral to get out of the deal and to get back the $22,000 they had paid for a deposit and upgrades. He wouldn't allow that, but he did offer to lower the price of the condo by $21,000 to $329,000 -- the amount he was asking new buyers to pay for a unit that was identical to the one the Owens had purchased two years ago. He also extended the deadline for closing until the end of November. The Owens haven't decided whether they will walk away from their deposit if they can't sell their old home by then. "We don't need two places," says Ms. Owen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, builders' willingness to lard up their incentives is putting added pressure on sellers of existing homes to do the same. Many are finding it necessary to add thousands of dollars in upgrades to compete with what builders are giving away. Jim Parker, an exclusive buyer's agent in Atlanta, says that in the last quarter, three out of the five buyers he's been working with have bailed out of a contract, while no one canceled during the same period a year ago. "Before, if something was not perfect, they'd buy it anyway. Now they won't," Mr. Parker says. Buyers are also demanding more upgrades. "They're asking for everything, right down to the flat-screen television," he says. "They're comparing houses to a brand-new house, and they expect the house to be updated with new paint and carpeting."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since most people who are buying are also selling -- seven out of 10 households already own homes -- some are finding themselves of two minds when it comes to kickouts. Glenn Nudell, a shipping executive, recently got $115,000 in concessions, including help with closing costs and fix-up money, when he bought a 12-year-old five-bedroom home in Skillman, N.J., for almost $1.1 million. If the seller hadn't agreed, he says, "I'd have backed away." But then he had to sell his eight-year-old, four-bedroom home in Princeton, N.J. He made sure it was as polished as a builder's model, with new wood floors and carpeting, new cabinets and even a newly finished basement -- but he couldn't sell it until he had knocked $70,000 off of his original $630,000 asking price. Is he concerned that the buyer of his house might back away from the deal before it closes next month? "Of course," he says.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Mark Whitehouse </div><div>571 words</div><div>2 November 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest data on manufacturing activity offered little support for the idea that the U.S. economy will rebound quickly from a slow third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management, a purchasing managers' trade group, said its manufacturing index fell to 51.2 in October, from 52.9 a month earlier. The new-orders component of the index, which offers a glimpse of potential manufacturing activity, fell to 52.1 from 54.2. Any number above 50 suggests expansion, but the October readings indicate that the manufacturing sector, which makes up about a fifth of the economy, was losing momentum as it entered the current quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's an indication that we've peaked and the rate of growth is slowing or will disappear for the short term," said Norbert Ore, who oversees the manufacturing survey and also serves as procurement director at Georgia-Pacific Corp. One bright spot, he said, was a sharp drop in the "prices paid" portion of the survey -- a sign that inflation pressures are easing along with energy prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said the deceleration in manufacturing suggests that slowdowns in both the housing and automobile sectors are spreading to the broader economy, as a drop in home and auto construction translates into fewer orders for factories. Mr. Ore named wood products, appliances, plastics and fabricated metals among the sectors that had seen the sharpest declines in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think I hear the footsteps of housing construction going up the supply chain," said Jim Meil, chief economist at Eaton Corp. in Cleveland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM report added to investor concerns about the U.S. economy's ability to recover from a tepid third quarter, during which its annualized, inflation-adjusted growth rate fell to an estimated 1.6% -- the slowest pace since 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent data have shown significant declines in housing and housing-related industries. Last week, the government estimated that residential investment fell at an annualized, inflation-adjusted rate of 17% in the third quarter -- the largest quarterly drop since 1991. Yesterday, the Commerce Department reported that overall construction spending fell 0.3% in September from a month earlier, and the National Association of Realtors said its index of pending home sales slipped 1.1% in September from August. Also in September, production in several housing-related sectors -- such as wood products and furniture -- dropped more than 1%, according to the Federal Reserve. All the data are seasonally adjusted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're going to be down compared to the recent cycle," said Richard Kelley, operations manager at Knoxville Drywall Inc., which does contracting mainly for residential housing projects in and around Knoxville, Tenn. "It's coming back to a more sustainable level." He said his orders for drywall were about flat in October compared with a year earlier, after rising more than 10% the year before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists argue that any downturn in manufacturing will be short-lived, because consumer demand remains healthy. Data on September personal income and consumption, for example, suggested people have money and are willing to spend. Drew Matus, an economist at Lehman Brothers in New York, says many company executives are probably holding back not because they can't find customers, but because they're wary of investing in production until they have a better idea of the depth of the downturn in housing.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Alex Frangos </div><div>1713 words</div><div>27 October 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unexpectedly rapid decline of the nation's housing market will mean an overall drop in construction spending next year, with spillover effects in areas such as job growth and real-estate development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a closely watched report expected to be released today, McGraw-Hill Construction will forecast the first decline in overall construction spending since 1991. The company says the value of new construction will decline 1% in 2007 to $668 billion, compared with an expected rise of 1% for 2006 and a 12% increase in 2005. McGraw-Hill said the anticipated decline was due mostly to a 5% fall in construction of single-family homes. But the overall drop also reflects a 3% slide in construction of stores and shopping centers, a component closely tied to population growth and home-building trends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Single-family housing has fallen more steeply than what we had anticipated and the correction is taking place faster," says Robert Murray, vice president at McGraw-Hill Construction, a unit of McGraw-Hill Cos. The industry "no longer has single-family housing to bolster total construction."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The construction industry accounts for almost a tenth of economic activity, and its contraction could have a ripple effect through the economy as it is a major buyer of finished products and generator of jobs. Local governments' ability to raise revenue through development fees and taxes, especially in fast-growing parts of the country, could suffer as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The McGraw-Hill forecast comes on the heels of a report yesterday by the Census Bureau showing that home builders have had to slash prices to sell homes. Although new-home sales for September rose 5.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.075 million, the median price fell to $217,100 from $240,400 a year earlier. That was the lowest price in two years and the biggest year-over-year decline since December 1970.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, at a conference yesterday in Washington, David Seiders, chief economist of the National Association of Home Builders, predicted average prices of single-family homes will drop next year. It is the first time the trade association has predicted a price decline in roughly a decade of providing estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Seiders blames a confluence of factors for the anticipated declines, including overbuilding, prices that have outpaced incomes, and rising inventories of unsold new and resale homes. The imbalance between supply and demand, as buyers continue to sit on the sidelines waiting for prices to drop, has already had a big impact on builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the second quarter of 2006, the annual rate of single-family starts fell 41.2% to 1.53 million, while "permits are in free fall," Mr. Seiders says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, prices still remain higher than several years ago and many consumers maintain hefty amounts of equity in their properties. Moreover, mortgage rates remain near historical lows and prices remain stable in many markets. Yet the latest news has prompted some economists to question whether the construction industry will become a drag on economic growth or whether the worst has already been felt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday, former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said he saw "early signs of stabilization" in the housing market. Mr. Greenspan noted in a speech to the Commercial Finance Association that a weekly index of applications for home-purchase mortgages, compiled by the Mortgage Bankers Association, has "flattened" at relatively high levels. The index plunged in the second half of 2005 and early this year, but lately has been steadier. It is currently 18% below the year-ago level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've already had the hard landing," Angelo Mozilo, chief executive officer of Countrywide Financial Corp., the nation's largest home-mortgage lender, said in a conference call this week. Mr. Mozilo said he expects the mortgage market to "tread water" in 2007. "In 2008," he added, "we'll have one hell of a year for people who remain in the industry" as demand rebounds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices rose an average of 58% in the five years ended Dec. 31, according to an index produced by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight. In some cities, prices more than doubled in that period. Over the past year or so, house prices have declined moderately in many areas -- including Massachusetts, the Washington, D.C., area and parts of California, Florida and Arizona -- but they remain far above their levels of a few years back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the negative effects from the housing slump are likely to linger well into 2007 and perhaps much longer. Some economists think housing prices will continue to drift downward through much of next year. That may damp consumer confidence, and it will diminish consumers' ability to borrow against their homes to finance spending. And foreclosures are expected to rise at least modestly; that could prolong weakness in housing as lenders dump properties on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're not out of the woods yet," says Peter Kretzmer, a senior economist at Bank of America in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Murray at McGraw-Hill Construction concurs. Just weeks ago, he was figuring there would still be growth next year. "We thought the correction [in the housing market] would be, in the words of Fed chairman, 'orderly,'" he says. But recent data have shown it is "not as orderly as what people thought."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the decline won't be limited to housing. Also expected to see a falloff is the construction of retail centers, whose development has been consistently strong in recent years as consumer spending and housing formation grew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The link between retail construction and home building is strong. "When there's a new neighborhood, there's a new grocery store and pizza parlor in a small shopping center," says James Haughey, director of Research and Analytics at Reed Construction Data, a Norcross, Ga., publisher of building information and a unit of Reed Elsevier Inc. He doesn't see retail falling off right away, however, as retailers are still catching up to consumer growth. "It will be a delayed impact because the pipeline of shopping centers is so full," Mr. Haughey says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The continued rapid construction of a wide range of other commercial projects -- hospitals, schools, offices, hotels and factories -- will keep bulldozers and backhoes somewhat busy and the massive construction industry active. That, of course, could be reassuring news for the economy. Spending on commercial construction, including multifamily dwellings, will increase 2.5%. Among the fastest-growing segments are hotels and manufacturing buildings, as well as schools and health-care facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction activity has a major impact on the overall economy. Census Bureau estimates of construction spending, which rely on McGraw-Hill's numbers while adding other spending categories, showed $1.2 trillion of spending on construction in the year ended August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fallout is being felt at some of the nation's largest home-building companies, which are downsizing staffs. Pulte Homes Inc. of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., said yesterday it has reduced its work force by about 10%, or 1,400 full-time jobs, since Jan. 1. The cuts have been made throughout the company and across the country. "We've taken these measures in response to lower housing demand, which has resulted in a reduction in construction volumes," Pulte spokesman Mark Marymee said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Centex Corp., a large builder based in Dallas, said this week that its salaried work force has been reduced by about 10% since April 1 to around 6,400 employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Phoenix area, construction accounts for 10% of salaried jobs, "and they are pretty good-paying jobs," says Jay Q. Butler, director of the Arizona Real Estate Center at Arizona State University. He sees the slowdown in the home-building sector being offset somewhat by strength in health care, schools, convention centers and highways. He cautions, however, that local governments that rely heavily on fees garnered from home builders could face fiscal crises. Several municipalities in his area, he says, are considering instituting or augmenting fees on commercial developers to make up for the projected shortfall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some developers could benefit from the housing downturn as demand for materials such as gypsum, copper electrical wire and lumber drop. Already this year, prices for those products have fallen. Falling house prices would also bring welcome relief to buyers who have been buffeted by steadily rising price tags.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certain sectors of the commercial construction industry could continue to grow. Hotel construction spending, for instance, was up 64.4% to $21 billion in August on a seasonally adjusted annual basis, according to the Commerce Department. Though McGraw-Hill predicts no growth in hotel spending, others think the increase is likely to continue in 2007. "The rebound in [hotel] construction is everywhere," says Bjorn Hanson, head of the hospitality-and-leisure practice for PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 70% to 80% of the hotels, says real-estate consultant Patrick Ford, are popping up near freeway exits with limited meeting spaces and food service. The area around Dulles International Airport in Virginia is adding 22 hotels, most in that mold, according to Mr. Ford, president of Lodging Econometrics in Portsmouth, N.H.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturing and industrial construction will grow thanks partly to the mushrooming of ethanol plants in the wake of federal legislation mandating increased supplies of the fuel additive. Matt Hartwig, spokesman for the Renewable Fuels Association, an ethanol trade group, says there are more than a "couple hundred" ethanol plants in development, with 46 under construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The office-building sector is also expected to grow as it reacts to recent job growth and business expansion. Office-vacancy rates nationally hit 13.5% in the third quarter, the lowest since the third quarter of 2001, says Sam Chandan, chief economist at Reis Inc., a New York-based research firm. And bond issues passed in several states to accommodate growing school-age populations has meant a classroom building boom. Fast-growing states such as Arizona and Nevada are adding dozens of schools a year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The median price of a new home in the U.S. last month plunged 9.7% from a year earlier, the steepest such drop in more than 35 years. But in a sign that the U.S. housing market could be nearing bottom, the pace of new-home sales rebounded for a second month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, orders for durable goods, such as cars and computers, in September surged 7.8% from the previous month, the largest gain since June 2000. Nearly all of the strength came from a huge increase in orders for commercial aircraft; outside of transportation, orders inched up 0.1%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data suggest the U.S. economy is still growing, albeit at a moderate pace. That's the scenario sought by the U.S. Federal Reserve, which Wednesday held short-term interest rates steady for a third straight month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Looking forward, there has been a significant improvement in the overall investment climate in the past month and a half -- inflation uncertainty has declined, long-term interest rates have moved down and the Fed has kept interest rates on an even keel," Brian Bethune, an economist at Global Insight, wrote in a research note.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the Commerce Department's measures of shipments and orders of "core" capital goods, or those excluding the volatile aircraft and defense sectors, suggest business investment is picking up and that the economy may regain some momentum in the fourth quarter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shipments of core capital goods plunged 2.1% in September and increased at a slower annual rate in the third quarter than they did in the second. But orders jumped 1.1% in September and rose at a faster annual rate in the third quarter than they did the previous quarter. High corporate profits are enabling businesses to invest in equipment and facilities that can lead to future growth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said the median price for a new home sold in September fell to $217,100 from $239,300 in August and $240,400 a year ago, the steepest year-to-year drop since December 1970.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But new-homes sales in September jumped 5.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.075 million homes -- the second straight rise in sales after three months of drops.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another hopeful sign for the economy, inventories of unsold homes and new homes decreased. The department said there were an estimated 557,000 homes for sale at the end of September, a 6.4 months' supply at the current sales rate. That represents a 1.9% decline in inventories from August, the sharpest decline since December 2000.  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp;Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A RECENT REPORT on inventories of unsold homes compiled by The Wall Street Journal was based on data from the end of the third quarter. A Personal Journal article Thursday incorrectly stated that the data were from the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(WSJ Oct. 28, 2006)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END) </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE AIR CONTINUES to seep out of the U.S. housing market, according to the latest data, and some economists are warning that prices will keep declining through much of 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors yesterday reported the biggest drop in home prices since the trade group began compiling price data in 1968. Specifically, the association said the median price for home sales completed in September was $220,000, down 2.2% from a year earlier. That matched a revised 2.2% decline in August. In addition to being the largest price drops in at least 38 years, the back-to-back declines are the first time median home prices have fallen since 1995.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other data gathered by The Wall Street Journal show large inventories of unsold homes and declining price trends in most major metropolitan areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Housing is still contracting," says Gregory Miller, chief economist at SunTrust Banks Inc. in Atlanta. "We haven't yet found the bottom." Mr. Miller doesn't expect house prices to resume their usual rising trend until 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest report is likely to encourage many potential buyers to hold off in the hope of further price declines. "There's no rush," says Robert Cook, a procurement manager living in Whitehall, Pa., who is looking to buy a larger home for his family in Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather than slash their prices, some sellers are taking homes off the market until they see stronger demand. Audrey Heckaman, a pharmaceutical sales representative in Cleveland, bought a new condo in a golfing community in Naples, Fla., in 2004 for $221,000. Early this year, she put it on the market for $429,000. But she found that too many other units in the same development were on the market. After cutting her price to $384,000, she yanked the home from the market in June and found renters for part of the year. In the long run, she figures, demand from retiring baby boomers will drive prices back up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those who want to buy now, sellers are dangling lots of incentives. A developer in Dadeland, Fla., near Miami, is offering $5,000 of furniture as an inducement for buyers of new condominiums, says Ronald A. Shuffield, president of the brokerage firm Esslinger-Wooten-Maxwell Inc. Other developers offer to pay some of the fees and other costs usually borne by home purchasers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some people who are forced to sell quickly are suffering huge losses. At an auction in Naples last weekend, the highest bid for a three-bedroom lakefront house was $440,000, including commissions and auction fees. The house had sold in July 2005 for $690,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the recent drop-off, house prices remain far above the levels of five years ago, and they continue to rise in some areas, including Seattle, Houston and Raleigh, N.C. But they are falling sharply in other places. In Massachusetts, the median price for single-family homes in September was down 8.3% from a year before, according to Warren Group Inc., a publisher and data collector in Boston. In Phoenix, the median price dropped 4.8% in September, the local Realtors association reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some areas, prices are only just beginning to fall back toward realistic levels, says Thomas Lawler, a housing economist in Vienna, Va. He believes that prices could fall more than 10% from their peak levels in markets such as Sacramento, Calif.; San Diego; Las Vegas; Reno, Nev.; Phoenix and parts of northern Virginia and Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, sales of previously occupied homes in September were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.2 million, down 1.9% from August and 14% from a year earlier, the Realtors group reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a mildly positive sign for home sellers, the number of homes listed for sale at the end of September declined 2.4% from a month earlier to 3.75 million. But that was smaller than the usual decline in September, when the resumption of school and the approach of the holidays typically begin to reduce the number of for-sale signs. Over the past decade, inventories of home sales have declined an average of 3.6% in September from the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories in September were up about 35% from a year earlier. A surge in inventories, fueled partly by investors rushing for the exits, began chilling the housing market in mid-2005 after a five-year boom that more than doubled prices in many areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the spreading weakness in house prices, few experts expect anything approaching a collapse. The economy continues to expand, though at a slower rate, and a recent drop in interest rates helps make mortgage costs more affordable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To gauge residential real-estate prospects for 27 major metro areas, The Wall Street Journal gathered data on inventories of homes for sale at the end of the second quarter from a variety of local sources; pricing trends based on surveys of real-estate agents by Daniel Oppenheim, an analyst at Banc of America Securities in New York, a unit of Bank of America Corp.; and data on late mortgage payments and job-creation prospects from Moody's Economy.com, a research firm in West Chester, Pa. Employment trends tend to drive demand for housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Metropolitan areas with large increases in homes on the market and weak job-growth projections include Detroit, New York and Los Angeles. Inventories have more than doubled from a year earlier in the Miami, Orlando, Tampa and Phoenix metro areas, but strong job and population growth should help to soak up excess supply in the next few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even within metro areas, price trends vary considerably depending on neighborhoods and types of housing. In northern New Jersey, for instance, prices for homes below about $400,000 may start rising again slightly by next spring if interest rates remain around current levels, says Jeffrey Otteau, president of Otteau Valuation Group Inc., an appraisal and research firm in East Brunswick, N.J. At that price level, "there's virtually zero construction," he says. But he says there is such a glut of luxury housing in the area that prices of such homes won't recover before 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Doyle, an agent at Naples Realty Services who compiles market data on his Web site ( www.naplesinsider.com[http://www.naplesinsider.com] ), estimates that prices for typical homes in the area are down 15% to 20% from their peak a year ago. Inventory has doubled during that time, but many of the homes on the market are priced so high that they have "only a lottery's chance of selling," he says. Looking ahead to this winter's selling season, Mr. Doyle says he expects prices to be flat to lower because of the large supply of homes for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seattle has been one of the strongest markets in recent months but is showing signs of losing some steam as inventories of unsold homes rise. In 17 counties of western and central Washington State covered by the Northwest Multiple Listing Service, the median price in September was up 9.4% from a year earlier, the first single-digit increase in two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Skahen, owner of real-estate brokerage Lake &amp;Co. in Seattle, says inventory is still lean in good neighborhoods near the area's biggest employers. But the overall market is slowing to a more normal pace as "buyers are feeling they can be more selective."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houston's market is benefiting from job growth at energy and technology companies and draws newcomers because of its low home prices. The median price in the second quarter was $152,700, compared with a national median of $227,500, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In North Carolina, Charlotte, Raleigh and some other areas have been strong lately as moderate weather and relatively low housing costs attract employers and retirees. Pat Riley, president of Allen Tate Realtors in Charlotte, has noticed increasing numbers of people moving to North Carolina from Florida to flee congestion and high housing and insurance costs. One hitch: Some people moving to Charlotte are having trouble selling their homes elsewhere and so are delaying purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of new and previously occupied homes sold in the eight-county Charlotte region was $182,000 in the third quarter, up 6% from a year earlier, according to Market Opportunity Research Enterprises, a research firm in Rocky Mount, N.C. But the Charlotte market may be starting to cool a bit. The Charlotte Regional Realtors Association reported that home sales in September slipped 2% from a year earlier, while the average price edged down 0.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The California Association of Realtors last week forecast that the median home price in the state will slip 2% to $550,000 in 2007, after rising 7% in 2006 and 16% in 2005. That would mark the first California-wide decline since 1996. California's last house-price slump lasted from 1992 through 1996.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leslie Appleton-Young, the California Realtors' chief economist, says she doesn't expect the current downturn to be as severe as the one in the 1990s because she thinks the job market will be healthier this time. Many people don't need to sell and will withdraw their homes from the market until demand recovers, she says. Still, she adds, some investors who bought near the top and took on too much debt "are going to get into trouble."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Existing-home sales in the U.S. fell in September for a sixth straight month, even though mortgage rates declined and the median home price was down 2.2% from a year earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home resales last month slowed to an annual rate of 6.18 million, a 1.9% decrease from August's unrevised 6.30 million annual pace, the National Association of Realtors said. The median home price was $220,000 in September, down from a revised $224,000 in August and an unrevised $225,000 in September 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR said the report indicates the U.S. housing market is stabilizing. "Considering that existing-home sales are based on closed transactions, this is a lagging indicator and the worst is behind us as far as a market correction -- this is likely the trough for sales," said NAR chief economist David Lereah.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The September resales level was slightly below Wall Street expectations of a 6.20 million sales rate for previously owned homes. The average 30-year mortgage rate was 6.4% last month, down from 6.52% in August, according to Freddie Mac. The rate was 5.77% in September 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the end of September, the inventory of homes on the market was 7.3 months, compared with a revised 7.3 months at the end of August, NAR said.  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rocketing house prices in Europe may be a thing of the past.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Following a decade of unrelenting gains, during which the value of many homes doubled, house-price growth has slowed this year in most European markets, even the U.K. Europe's stretch of low interest rates may be coming to an end, and people are starting to be priced out of the market, particularly in the U.K., Ireland and Spain. "We expect price growth to continue to slow in the next two years across most countries," says Liam Bailey, head of residential research at real-estate advisory firm Knight Frank LLP in London. In the U.S., rising interest rates also have helped put a damper on the market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Spain, which has the highest rate of homeownership in Western Europe, average house prices are expected to rise 12% this year, down from a 15% rise last year, says Javier Ochoa, director of land and development at real-estate-advisory firm Savills PLC in Madrid. Spain's strong economy and high demand for homes, despite the looming threat of interest-rate increases, is fueling the growth, he says. The average cost of a home in Madrid or Barcelona is around 446,000 euros ($560,000), according to Savills.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In France, it is a similar story. House prices rose 9.4% in the first half of this year, slowing from the 15.3% growth in the first half of 2005, according to Knight Frank, and the average cost of a home in Paris is 345,180 euros.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.K., one of Europe's most buoyant residential markets, gains have been more sedate. Home prices are likely to increase 5% this year, up from 3% last year, according to Nationwide, a mutual building society based in Swindon, England.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average house price in the U.K. as of Sept. 30 was GBP 168,460 ($315,590), up GBP 13,000 from last year, according to Nationwide spokeswoman Zoe Stevens. However, in some cities, such as London, prices have risen much faster, partly driven by an increase in overseas buyers as well as renewed interest following London's winning bid to host the 2012 Olympic Games, says Nationwide. The average price of a home in London has increased by 7.3% in the first nine months of this year to GBP 259,646.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A slowdown was inevitable, many real-estate experts say, following several years of exceptional growth. According to Knight Frank, house prices have more than doubled in the U.K. and Spain since January 2000. During the same period, house prices climbed 88% in France, 69% in the U.S. and 74% in Australia, according to Knight Frank.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These markets have been driven in part by strong local economies but also, in many cases, by a long tradition of homeownership, especially in markets such as the U.K., where it is typically less expensive to buy than to rent a home. Just 43% of people own their own home in Germany, far below the European Union average of 63%, according to real-estate consultancy BulwienGesa AG, which is based in Berlin. In Spain, 85% of people own their own home, compared with 71% in the U.K. and 63% in France. In the U.S., 68% of the population are homeowners.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, in Germany, the tale of growth couldn't be more different: The housing market stagnated, and prices have remained flat for a decade. The country is only now starting to pull out of a prolonged period of slow growth, and it is commonly less expensive to rent than buy, particularly in big cities, making renting more popular, says Gertrud Nesshoever, residential project leader at BulwienGesa.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Germany's housing market remains the flattest in Europe, with the average price unchanged over the past decade, at 234,182 euros. However, BulwienGesa is forecasting that the average price of a home will climb 7.8% by the end of 2010, as slow construction in some cities, such as Dusseldorf, has led to demand outstripping supply, Ms. Nesshoever says. In addition, she says, the increase in value-added tax to 19% from 16% starting next year will push up the cost of construction, which also is likely to affect house prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There also are signs that the housing market is slowing in the U.S. According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the average price of a single-family home was $241,100 in the second quarter, down 3% from $247,000 in the previous quarter, though between February 2005 and February 2006, house prices rose on average by 3%.  </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Consumer Prices Fall, but Core Measure Inches Higher</span>
</div><div class="author">By Christopher Conkey </div><div>870 words</div><div>19 October 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling gasoline prices pushed overall consumer prices lower in September, significantly increasing Americans' purchasing power, but underlying data signaled plenty of inflation hazards ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the nation's home builders stepped up construction last month, defying signs of a weakening housing market. But a sharp decline in building permits points to softening in residential construction in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer prices fell 0.5% in September, led by a 13.5% plunge in gasoline prices, the Labor Department said. Excluding food and energy, the department's "core" measure of consumer prices rose 0.2% for the third consecutive month. This measure is closely monitored by Federal Reserve policy makers because it gives a clearer picture of underlying activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists said the modest rise in core prices is another sign that inflation is retreating enough to dissuade the Federal Reserve from changing interest rates anytime soon. "We may have seen the peak of this inflation scare," said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at Wachovia Corp., of Charlotte, N.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">September was the first month this year that overall consumer prices didn't rise, and it relieved some of the pressure on consumers' pocketbooks. The average worker's weekly pay outpaced inflation by 1% in September; inflation-adjusted wages last month were up 2.2% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest figures tentatively suggest that the economic scenario of slower expansion and reduced inflation sought by the Fed is playing out. "We are in the midst of a near picture-perfect soft landing," said Bernard Baumohl, executive director of the Economic Outlook Group, of Princeton Junction, N.J. "What's most interesting from the latest set of reports is that this economy may be ready to take off again by mid-2007."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price gains could reaccelerate if gasoline prices rebound or the economy gains more momentum, and inflation is far stronger than the Fed would like it to be. The Labor Department's measure of core consumer prices in September was up 2.9% from a year ago, outpacing the 2.1% rise in prices overall. Similarly, the Commerce Department's core price indicator, the personal-consumption expenditure price index -- the Fed's preferred inflation gauge -- rose 0.2% in August and was 2.5% higher than a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both measures show core inflation running at its fastest clip in more than 10 years, and well above the Fed's presumed comfort zone of between a 1% and 2% rate. The Fed has indicated it can tolerate higher-than-usual levels of core inflation for the short term, but any further acceleration could prompt it to raise interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means core inflation must slow somewhat from its current trend of 0.2% monthly gains before the Fed is satisfied that inflation risks are abating. Haseeb Ahmed, an economist at J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;Co., of New York, said if core inflation continues to expand at its current monthly rate, the annual rate as measured by the Labor Department will hover at 2.9% for the next two months before rising to 3.0% in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, the plunge in oil prices and the slowdown in economic expansion appear to be having an impact. After rising at an annual rate of more than 3.5% in the second quarter, core inflation increased at a slower 2.9% in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking earlier this week, San Francisco Fed president Janet Yellen said: "Although I'm somewhat encouraged that various measures of core inflation have edged down recently, it's clear that more progress is needed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inflation expectations, as measured by consumer surveys and yield spreads in the bond market, have also retreated. That is extremely important for the Fed's credibility, because expectations of higher inflation can have a self-fulfilling effect, as workers push for higher wages and companies charge higher prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several other wild cards could affect the inflation outlook. Labor costs, which have been rising, could further accelerate and exert more inflation pressure in the months ahead. The degree to which the housing market stabilizes or continues to weaken will have a major impact on overall expansion, and therefore on estimates of how much inflation may decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported yesterday that new-home construction last month rose 5.9% from August to an annual rate of 1.77 million units. Housing starts were still down 18% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But permits for new construction, an indicator of future activity, fell 6.3% in September and there is still a historically high inventory of unsold homes on the market. Prices are also falling in many markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, many economists said, home builders will be forced to curtail new construction in the months ahead. "The bounce in housing starts is a temporary phenomenon," said Dave Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders, of Washington, D.C. "There's no question we have a supply-demand balance problem right now."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. Treasurys were mostly higher, little affected by mixed inflation data and a rebound in housing activity, late yesterday morning in New York.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Following release of data showing the core consumer-price index from a year ago was up 2.9%, the biggest gain in 10 years, and an unexpectedly strong performance of the housing sector, Treasury prices slipped before trading mixed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-year Treasury note rose to 100 29/32, up 4/32 to yield 4.76%. The 30-year Treasury rose 12/32 to 94 1/32, yielding 4.88%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government said September housing starts rose 5.9% after a 4.9% drop in August.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Although the headline [housing] figure rose last month, September's data probably do not signal that a bottom in groundbreaking activity has been reached, especially given that the permits continued to fall last month and that nearly the entire increase in housing starts was concentrated in the South," said RBS Greenwich economist Omair Sharif.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separate U.S. government reports showed an increase in American workers' average weekly earnings and an unexpected rise in home-construction activity in September, which snapped three months of declines.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energy prices fell 7.2%, with gasoline costs dropping 13.5%. In an encouraging sign for the winter heating season, home fuel-oil prices declined 6.1%, though natural gas and electricity prices rose. Food prices increased 0.3%, with vegetable prices jumping 6.6%, the biggest increase since April 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in core prices "likely reflects pressure coming from the steep slowing in new auto prices evident in the producer-price index and likely soon to hit the CPI, too," wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, in a note to clients.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts rose 5.9% to a seasonally adjusted 1.772 million annual rate in September, the Commerce Department said yesterday. In August, construction fell 4.9% to a 1.674 million rate, revised from an originally reported 6% drop to 1.665 million. Starts fell 4% in July and 6.1% during June.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The September figure suggests there may be less downside to the housing market than had been feared, but building permits fell 6.3% to an annual rate of 1.619 million.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- A housing-sector group has again lowered its forecast for 2006 home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors estimates 2006 sales of previously owned homes will decrease 8.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.45 million. Just a month ago, the group projected 2006 sales falling 7.6% to a 6.54 million rate. In August, the industry group's forecast was for a 6.5% decline to 6.61 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The association projects the median existing-home price will climb 1.6% to $223,000 in 2006. In August, the group forecast a 4.3% rise to $229,000. </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Whistling Past Housing's Graveyard? --- Builders' Shares Have Been Hot, Sparking Debate Among Investors On Whether Sector Has Hit Bottom</span>
</div><div class="author">By Michael Corkery </div><div>1101 words</div><div>9 October 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOME-BUILDER STOCKS are bucking a trend -- one that has the rest of the housing industry in a tizzy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Wilshire U.S. Home Construction Index of home-builder stocks has increased about 15% since July 18 -- even as each passing week shows the nation's housing statistics heading down. While the index is still down for the year, that recent rise has outpaced broader market indexes and set off a debate among investors about whether the slowdown might end sooner for the home builders than many expect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some bulls believe builder stocks hit a bottom toward the end of July, around the time that the Federal Reserve signaled it was considering a pause in its two-year campaign of interest-rate increases. Since the housing sector is so sensitive to mortgage rates, the signal mattered to home builders. The question now is whether the Fed's pause -- and a recent drop in long-term interest rates -- will be enough to bolster a sector so exposed to a housing slowdown that seems to be getting worse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the National Association of Realtors, sales of existing homes were down 12.6% in August from a year earlier, and the median price of homes sold dropped 1.7% over that period -- the first year-to-year price decline in 11 years. Sales of new homes were down 17.4% in August from a year ago, according to the Census Bureau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some stocks seem unfazed by the headlines. For instance, shares of Lennar Corp., which reported on Sept. 8 that it was reducing third-quarter earnings estimates because of the continued housing slump, have risen roughly 6% since then. In 4 p.m. trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, Lennar's shares were down 52 cents to $45.12, giving the company a market value of $7.26 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If the sector stops going down with bad news, it may imply that it has found a bottom," says John Buckingham, chief executive of Al Frank Asset Management, which has $800 million under management and whose investment newsletter, the Prudent Speculator, has recommended more builder shares in recent months. But Mr. Buckingham says his funds haven't added to their home-building stake recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are volatile stocks and bears believe the recent gains could easily be reversed as the housing market continues to slide. Banc of America Securities analyst Daniel Oppenheim last week downgraded Pulte Homes Inc. to "sell" from "neutral" and D.R. Horton, to "neutral" from "buy," citing the recent appreciation of their stocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some bulls aren't dissuaded. Citigroup analyst Stephen Kim declared in a report last month that it is "a buyer's market" for the stocks. Josh Spencer, an analyst who covers the home-building sector at T. Rowe Price in Baltimore, says builder stocks are too inexpensive to pass up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even after their rally, many builders trade slightly above their book value, which is a company's assets minus its liabilities, and is often regarded as a rough estimate of how a business would be valued if liquidated. The big players like Pulte, Lennar, Horton and Toll Brothers also trade at less than six times earnings, based on the four most recent quarters of results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All historical metrics tell you [to] buy the stocks here," says Mr. Spencer, who says his firm has increased its home-builder holdings in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides being cheap, the bulls argue home-builder inventories may have peaked in some markets. And the pull back in interest rates could help renew demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Citigroup's Mr. Kim, whose firm has investment-banking relationships with several home builders, says the stocks could get a boost when the companies report fourth-quarter earnings because cancellations on orders for new homes could decrease and the year-over-year comparisons will be easier. By the first quarter of next year, he believes cancellation rates will be lower and order trends will be better than the first quarter of 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet trying to time a rebound in this sector is an extraordinarily risky game, because the fundamentals of the overall market still look so weak, even to the builders. Many builders aren't giving earnings guidance for next year because the outlook is so murky. Moreover, builders are still using incentives to lure in buyers, which eat into their profit margins. A report by Moody's Economy.com said house prices could keep falling until 2008 or 2009 in some areas. Private-equity groups -- investment pools that look for companies they can buy on the cheap, fix up and resell -- have been looking at the battered sector, but are expected to hold off taking any companies private until the housing market bottoms and begins to stabilize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are in uncharted waters and you just don't know if there is reef ahead," says Edgar Wachenheim III, chairman of Greenhaven Associates, a Purchase, N.Y., investment firm, with $3.5 billion in assets under management, who sold off his builder stocks a year ago and is staying away from the sector. "I don't know how any reasonable person can know where the stocks are going to go."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another dark cloud over the sector is the threat that builders' land holdings will lose value as land prices decline. That could mean that some land may be worth less than they paid for it. The bulls counter that the land issue is overstated because builders are increasingly using options, which allows them to walk away from land deals and minimize their losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some problems may lie ahead when builders construct more houses on land they bought more recently at higher prices. As of the end of last year, 28% of land owned by home builders was negotiated in 2004 and 2005, 46% in 2003, when land prices started to take off, and 26% in earlier years, according to a report by analyst Ivy Zelman of Credit Suisse, which does business with several home builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, Ms. Zelman downgraded Horton to "neutral" from "outperform" after estimating that 48% of its owned land is at prices negotiated in 2004 and 2005. Meantime, she upgraded MDC Holdings Inc. from "neutral" to "outperform," citing its relatively short supply of land.</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty and Anjali Athavaley </div><div>1185 words</div><div>5 October 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOME BUYERS HAVE another reason to sit on their hands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the latest news from the slumping U.S. housing market, a report released this week says that median house prices are likely to decline more than 10% over the next few years in 20 metro areas, including Las Vegas, Tucson, Ariz., and Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report, by Moody's Economy.com Inc., a research firm in West Chester, Pa., also says that the slump won't end quickly. Indeed, according to the report, prices may keep falling until 2008 or even 2009 in some areas. In all, prices are falling or likely to decline soon in about 100 metro areas, the firm says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study comes on the heels of a survey from the U.S. Census Bureau showing that 35% of American homeowners with mortgages last year spent 30% or more of their household income on housing costs, including loan payments, real-estate taxes, insurance and utilities. In 2003, a similar survey found that 30% of such homeowners were spending that much on housing. The new survey illustrates the strain on household budgets that has already helped slow house-price increases in some areas and push them modestly lower in others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proliferation of headlines about a weakening housing market is encouraging some potential buyers to hold off until prices look like they're near a bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nillani McClain, a 35-year-old human-resources manager who lives in an apartment in Brooklyn, N.Y., has been looking at condominiums and townhouses in New Jersey with her husband, David. But given the recent slowdown news, the McClains are leaning toward waiting until next spring -- and then looking in Manhattan, a market they had originally thought they couldn't afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are taking into consideration the option of finding something in the city and not having to move out to Jersey if prices drop considerably," Ms. McClain says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers and sellers can use forecasts from Economy.com and others for guidance as they try to figure out how to play this tricky market. But because the reports don't agree on which markets will be the weakest or how severe the slump will be, they could also be left scratching their heads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While various studies generally agree that some of the biggest risks of declines are in California and Florida, there are striking differences, reflecting different forecasting methods. For instance, a recent "risk index" study published by PMI Mortgage Insurance Co. ranks the Boston metro area as the seventh-riskiest in the nation in terms of the likelihood of price declines over the next two years. But Economy.com says that home prices in Boston likely bottomed out in this year's third quarter after a modest 2.2% decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No study, of course, can tell exactly how bad the market will get or when it will hit bottom. Even if accurate, a prediction for a metro area won't hold true for all neighborhoods or all types of housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news, according to Economy.com's chief economist, Mark Zandi, is that the current downturn so far looks more like a correction than a crash on a national scale, slowing economic growth but not tipping the economy into a recession. The bad news is that falling prices could be very painful for some people who have bought homes near peak levels over the past year or so in such areas as California, Arizona, Nevada, Florida, Washington, D.C., and the coastal Northeast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing markets in most of these areas began turning down about a year ago after prices more than doubled in many cities during a frantic five-year buying spree. It still isn't clear how hard the landing will be. Last week, the National Association of Realtors reported that the median sales price of a previously occupied home slipped 1.7% in August from a year earlier. That was the first decline from a year earlier in more than a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other signals are mixed. Yesterday, for example, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported that its seasonally adjusted index of applications for home-purchase loans surged 7.6% in the week ended Sept. 29. But that index is volatile from week to week, and it is still down about 15% from a year ago. In a more positive sign for housing, mortgage interest rates have declined over the past two months. Inventories of unsold homes continue to rise in much of the country, though they have leveled off or fallen slightly in some cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economy.com based its price forecasts on a broad range of factors including demographic trends, job markets, mortgage rates, lending standards, construction costs and limits on land development. Mr. Zandi says the economic model doesn't take into account the supply of previously occupied homes available for sale because there aren't enough reliable data on that nationwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among major metro areas vulnerable to steep price declines, Economy.com points to Nassau and Suffolk counties in suburban New York. For the rest of the New York City area, the firm sees a milder downturn, with the median price bottoming out in late 2008 just 3.5% below its peak in this year's second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Las Vegas housing market is being hurt by an exodus of speculators who have dumped homes on the market, and construction payrolls have been shrinking as developers cancel condo projects. But Economy.com says job growth in leisure and retail businesses will help offset the housing downturn in Las Vegas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Miami's high house prices have sent some residents scurrying northward to slightly less expensive areas, and the city is highly dependent on investment from Latin America, which "could easily dry up or even go into reverse," the report warns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For sellers, the real-estate news adds to their headaches. Laurie Siegel, a 62-year-old retired nurse in West Orange, N.J., is trying to sell a three-bedroom house so that she can buy a condo. The house was listed six weeks ago at $449,900, and Ms. Siegel hasn't had any serious offers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If I don't get enough for the house, how am I going to buy the condo?" Ms. Siegel asks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, she has refused to lower the price of the house. "I think it's all a gamble," she says.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jim Carlton </div><div>576 words</div><div>4 October 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lumber prices have fallen to their lowest weekly level in nearly five years as the slowdown in the U.S. housing market dries up demand for building products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of Friday, weekly composite prices per thousand board feet of framing lumber had fallen to $274 from $401 a year earlier, according to Random Lengths, an industry newsletter. On an average monthly basis, prices are at their lowest levels since mid-2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 32% plunge is far steeper than industry executives predicted, resulting mostly from a sharper-than-expected falloff in housing activity. The Commerce Department reported last month that housing starts dropped 6% in August from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.665 million units. That was the fifth decline in construction starts in the past six months and the slowest rate of starts since April 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, producers are racing to try to curtail production in mills, as industry profits have been pummeled. Prices of other building materials, like gypsum and cement, have also fallen or moderated in tandem with the slackened demand. So far this year as of Monday, forestry and wood stocks tracked by Morningstar Inc. have fallen 4.3%, compared with an 8.9% rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average over the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These are commodity markets, and what goes up must come down," said Shawn Church, editor of Random Lengths, Eugene, Ore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, Weyerhaeuser Co. announced it was indefinitely suspending production at two of its mills in Saskatchewan, Canada. Officials of the forest-products giant, based in Federal Way, Wash., said the closures in the western Canadian province were tied to market conditions. Weyerhaeuser told analysts at a conference two weeks ago that they expected the company's third-quarter lumber sales to decline about 8% from the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another manufacturer, Louisiana-Pacific Corp., in August indefinitely shut down a big mill in Quebec in response to the slowdown. L-P, of Nashville, Tenn., specializes in making oriented strand board, an engineered lumber product that has been hard-hit. Popular among builders for its strength and durability, OSB prices had soared to a record $591 per thousand square feet in 2004. But in the past year, prices dropped to $207 as of last month from $433, according to Random Lengths.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lumber has historically been a boom-bust business, with cycles largely tied to the housing market. With housing on a roll from 2002 until early last year, lumber producers enjoyed some of their best business ever. Industry economists warned of an impending housing slowdown in 2004 and 2005, but when it didn't happen, manufacturers said they didn't pay too much heed. "As an industry, we were lulled a little bit," said Curt Stevens, chief financial officer and executive vice president of L-P.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March and April, however, Mr. Stevens says his company and others started seeing order cancellations. Once-hot housing markets like Las Vegas and Phoenix suddenly cooled, amid rising rates and other factors, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This downturn could prove less damaging than past ones because many producers were able to shore up their balance sheets during the boom period. "The question is, how long will the downturn last?" said Paul Latta, director of research at McAdams Wright Ragen, a brokerage firm in Seattle. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. manufacturing sector, hurt by softer domestic auto sales and a weakening housing market, expanded at a slower pace last month than in August, a trade group said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, spending on construction projects unexpectedly edged up in August as the best gain in nonresidential activity in 11 months offset another big decline in home building. In addition, pending sales of U.S. existing homes rose by 4.3% in August, indicating the housing market may be stabilizing, the National Association of Realtors said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Institute for Supply Management, a private research group, said its index of manufacturing activity for September cooled to a reading of 52.9, after standing at 54.5 in August and 54.7 in July. Readings above 50 point to expansion in activity and describe the breadth of the change seen, although not the magnitude of the advance.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The manufacturing sector continues on a trend of slowing growth in September," said Norbert Ore, who directs the survey. "While there was little change in new orders and production when compared to August, significant slowing took place in employment and inventories," and "it's apparent that manufacturing is losing momentum and feeling the effects of higher interest rates and a weaker housing market," he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the report, the group found ebbing inflationary pressures, with the prices index hitting 61.0, from 73.0 the month before. The index was at 78.5 in July.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its report, the U.S. Commerce Department said construction spending rose by 0.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.2 trillion. It represented the best showing in five months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonresidential construction was up 3.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $312 billion. The strength came from increases in construction of offices, hotels and the category that includes shopping centers. Spending on private-home construction dropped 1.5% in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $617 billion.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By Christopher Conkey </div><div>533 words</div><div>3 October 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturing activity expanded in September, but the nation's factories appear to be losing some steam as economic growth moderates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management, a private group of corporate purchasing managers, said its manufacturing index fell to 52.9 last month from 54.5 in August. Readings over 50 indicate expansion, but the September measure suggests that factories experienced slightly weaker growth as the third quarter progressed. Recent data on industrial production and factory orders have also pointed to slower growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's apparent that manufacturing is losing momentum and feeling the effects of higher interest rates and a weaker housing market," said Norbert Ore, who oversees the ISM survey and also serves as Georgia-Pacific Corp.'s procurement director.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slower economic growth is likely to damp inflationary pressures, and makes it more probable that the Federal Reserve will leave interest rates unchanged, or eventually begin to lower them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ISM said one wood-products company that participated in its survey of procurement managers at 400 medium-size to large companies reported seeing a "serious downturn in customer orders related to the housing-market" slump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other data released yesterday offered signs that the residential real-estate market may be stabilizing after a slowdown in sales over the past year. The National Association of Realtors said its index of pending home sales rose 4.3% in August from July but remains 14% below the year-earlier pace. A recent Commerce Department report showed that the rate of new-home sales picked up in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Lereah, NAR's chief economist, said the August figures suggest that the housing market has hit bottom. Others disagreed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Investors Service, said it was "premature" to view the unexpected rise in sales in August as "indicating the nearness of a bottom for home sales." Daniel Oppenheim, an analyst with Bank of America Securities, said a high inventory of unsold homes would depress prices and that surveys of real-estate agents point to slower sales in coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM's readings on employment, tracking hiring in the manufacturing sector, and on prices, reflecting what manufacturers pay for materials, both declined last month. The group's reading on new orders for goods was unchanged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the slower growth rate, September was the 40th consecutive month of expansion in the manufacturing sector. That marked the longest uninterrupted growth streak since the 1970s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, economists said they expect slow to moderate growth for the rest of the year. "We see the economy continuing its forward momentum, but at a below-trend pace over the next six months," said John Silvia, chief economist at Wachovia Corp., in a research note. He predicted that the economy would expand at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 2.5% in the second half of the year. Mr. Silvia said that will keep the Federal Reserve from raising or lowering interest rates for the rest of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Commerce Department said construction spending rose 0.3% in August from July as residential construction declined but commercial building picked up. </p>

</div><div class="author">By Rafael Gerena-Morales and Michael Corkery </div><div>778 words</div><div>28 September 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest readings on business investment and housing muddied the economic picture: Orders for big-ticket goods fell unexpectedly in August as new-home sales rose unexpectedly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported that durable-goods orders declined 0.5% in August to a seasonally adjusted $209.75 billion, following a revised 2.7% decline in July. That marked the first back-to-back decline since April and May 2004. Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft -- a barometer of business equipment spending -- fell 0.3% in August, following a 0.9% gain the two preceding months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The durable-goods report was "far more bearish than anticipated," said Jason Schenker, an economist at Wachovia Corp. in Charlotte, N.C. "This raises concerns about how much economic growth is poised to slow. . . . We'll need more data to see if the economy is coming in for a hard or soft landing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The durable-goods report showed that demand fell for machinery, computers and electronics, primary metals and commercial aircraft, although motor-vehicle orders were up. Durable goods are items intended to last three years or more, such as cars and computers. While durable-goods orders can be volatile, economists closely monitor them because they are considered an indicator of future production activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists are counting on business investment to help offset the effect of a cooling economy and housing market, and softer consumer spending. The consensus among analysts is that second-half economic growth will slow to below 3%, at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, following a 2.9% advance in the second quarter and a 5.6% gain in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Census Bureau reported that sales of new homes rose 4.1% in August from a month earlier, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.050 million. The unexpected jump ran counter to other recent data depicting slowing sales. But analysts cautioned not to focus too much on a one-month statistic. Indeed, compared with August a year ago, new-home sales were down 17.4%. And earlier this week, the National Association of Realtors said existing-home sales in August fell for the fifth consecutive month, while the national median price fell, year over year, for the first time in 11 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's hard to get overly excited about an increase like this," said David Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders. "The weight of evidence shows that the housing market was trending downward in August."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR sales data are based on closings of previously owned homes. In contrast, Mr. Seiders said, the new-home sales data are based on a relatively small sample of sales contracts or deposits and fail to capture cancellations on contracts, which home builders say have been surging in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales are frequently revised. (On average, the Census Bureau says preliminary estimates are revised by about 3%.) July sales were revised yesterday to 1.009 million from a preliminary estimate of 1.072 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, some builders say conditions got worse in August, not better. On Tuesday, Stuart Miller, the chief executive of Lennar Corp, one of the nation's largest home builders, said in a conference call, "August might have been the weakest month yet." The Miami builder said that its cancellation rate was running at more than 30% and that it was using incentives to drive sales. Lennar cut its earnings guidance for the fourth quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index declined in August and September, reaching the lowest reading since February 1991.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say new-home sales may have gotten a slight bounce last month as mortgage rates eased and builders offered more incentives to entice buyers. The median price of a new home was $237,000 in August, compared with the median price of $240,100 in August 2005. The average price of a new home was $304,400 in August, compared with the average price of $295,000 in August 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, analysts noted yesterday that durable goods orders are volatile and can offer imprecise monthly readings. Moreover, some economists said durable goods orders remain healthy on a year-over-year basis: In the eight months through August, orders were 8.5% higher than the same period a year ago, on an unadjusted basis, and business equipment spending is up nearly 10% from a year ago. </p>

</div><div class="author">By John D. McKinnon and Christopher Conkey </div><div>1108 words</div><div>28 September 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Washington -- A WAVE OF POSITIVE economic news, capped by this week's run-up in the stock market and a continuing drop in gasoline prices, seems to be coming at an ideal time for Republicans worried about the November elections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as President Bush knows, good economic news doesn't always translate into votes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've had a little history of that in our family, you might remember," he said at a Rose Garden news conference this month, to laughter from assembled reporters. Mr. Bush's reference was to the experience of his father, President George H.W. Bush, who lost his bid for re-election in 1992 even though the economy actually was recovering nicely through much of the election year. The elder Bush was defeated by Bill Clinton -- whose mantra became "It's the economy, stupid" -- in part because voters were slow to believe good economic news or see it seeping down to them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many political analysts say it can take several months for good economic news to change voter psychology. Still, the improvement in some key economic sectors at least gives Republicans a chance to turn around some impressions in the six weeks before this year's midterm elections. "There's no question the Republicans have been due for a break and they've finally gotten it, between the stock-market rise and the fall of gasoline prices," said Republican Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma. Gas prices have "an enormous impact on [voter] psychology and their belief that the incumbents are doing the right thing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the war against terrorism, in Iraq and elsewhere, remains a dominant theme in the campaign debate, the economy provides the crucial backdrop. Democrats have sought to score points on a variety of economic worries, including pressures from gas prices, health-care inflation, college tuition and overseas competition for jobs. That's been particularly true in key states in the industrial Midwest, where economic anxieties are more prominent than elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's why Republicans are particularly happy to see recent positive news in some closely watched symbols of economic performance. The Dow Jones Industrial Average yesterday came within a whisker of setting a record high, closing at 11689.24, up 9.1% this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps more important politically, gas prices, which voters identified as the most important economic issue in a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll this month, have fallen more than 60 cents a gallon since last month. "The temporary relief has taken a lot of the anger out of that issue," said Democratic Rep. Jim Cooper of Tennessee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no telling which way gas prices will move in the weeks before the election. Yesterday, for example, the price of oil rose nearly $2 to roughly $63 a barrel on the prospect that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will limit production to boost prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On other fronts, consumer spending and business investment are holding up well, unemployment is holding steady at 4.7% and yesterday, the Commerce Department reported that the pace of new-home sales in August rose 4.1% from July, a possible sign that the slowdown in the residential real-estate market may be stabilizing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Republicans also see hints that they will finally be able to tout statistical increases in ordinary workers' wages too, thanks to falling gasoline prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are plenty of trouble signs as well. The Commerce report also said the sales pace in recent months was even weaker than initially thought, a more ominous warning sign. And overall economic growth, while healthy, isn't stunning. After surging earlier this year, the economy downshifted into slower growth this summer as it absorbed the impact of higher interest rates, elevated energy prices and a weakening housing market. Many economists now expect the economy to grow at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of roughly 2.5% over the second half of the year, down from a pace of over 4.0% in the first half.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, President Bush appears to believe that the economy ranks among Republicans' strongest weapons in the 2006 fight. In recent days he's been talking up his tax cuts frequently out on the campaign trail, and warning that Democrats will roll them back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response, Democrats argue that the type of good economic news now being seen isn't translating into good news for average workers. "We're seeing an economy that is doing very well for the wealthiest five or ten percent . . . [but] middle and working and poorer families aren't seeing a raise," said Democratic Rep. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who is in a tight race for the Senate with incumbent Republican Mike DeWine. "The economy is not there to serve only to make profits . . . for corporations."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In any case, there are doubts about when good news affects voter behavior. Voters' impressions of the economy for at least nine months running up to a presidential election appear to be relevant to their decisions at the polls, according to Ray C. Fair, a Yale University economist who has developed perhaps the best-known model for predicting presidential-race outcomes. And unusual economic performance going back as far as 15 quarters before an election can be relevant, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That suggests, among other things, that along with happiness about easing gas prices, voters in November also will be remembering the sting of $3-a-gallon gas during the summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's also possible that voter views of the economy are changing in ways that could be unwelcome for most Republicans, particularly in light of the war on terrorism. Mr. Bush and his advisers worry that the difficult war on terrorism -- coupled with the pain and uncertainty of accelerating globalization -- could be fueling more protectionist sentiment in the U.S. and around the world. In the face of such worries, short-term economic improvements might not matter as much as they used to, some experts believe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The growing polarization of American politics also appears to be coloring the way people say they view the economy, so it's hard to tell how big a factor it will really be, says Gary Jacobson, a political scientist at the University of California at San Diego. Still, "as long as it's not exceptionally bad or good it's probably a neutral factor," he says.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Ruth Simon </div><div>1265 words</div><div>28 September 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AS THE HOUSING market cools, one of the hardest decisions facing home sellers is how to price their properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traditionally, brokers have set listing prices by reviewing how much comparable homes sold for in a neighborhood. Now, with prices edging lower in many places and the number of homes on the market climbing, checking comparable sales is becoming less useful. At the same time, many would-be buyers are sitting on the sidelines, waiting to see how far prices will fall. Bigger inventories of unsold homes also are making it harder for sellers to figure out how to make their house stand out amid the competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What it takes to sell a house varies from market to market. Some brokers are telling customers they need to underprice the competition -- even if they think their home is more attractive. Sharon Baum, a senior vice president with the Corcoran Group in New York, recently listed a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment for $3.7 million. That was $100,000 less than the asking price for a similar unit five floors below, even though apartments on higher floors typically carry bigger price tags. "As buyers have more choices, you've got to make your apartment stand out," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sellers are also being told to cut prices aggressively if their house isn't moving -- or risk chasing the market downward. If a home doesn't get any showings in 21 days or gets 10 showings but no offers, Ned Redpath, president and owner of Coldwell Banker Redpath &amp;Co. in Hanover, N.H., often advises the seller to slice the asking price by 10%. "We don't like to see $2,000 or $5,000 price adjustments," he says. "We want to see a real whack" that attracts attention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders of new homes also are tinkering with their pricing formulas to generate sales. Mid-Atlantic Builders in Rockville, Md. is offering to adjust the sales price downward up to 45 days before closing if the price on one of its similar homes declines. Waterford Development Corp. will have homes in its Woodland Pond at Manchester development in New Hampshire reappraised two years after closing. If the price drops, the company says it will write the buyer a check for up to 15% of the original sales price, not including the value of any optional upgrades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in relatively strong markets, brokers are paying closer attention to price trends. Wallace Perry, president of Coldwell Banker United, Realtors, Carolinas region, says he has begun checking multiple-listing service data every week or two instead of once a quarter to see how recent sales compare with deals that closed three and six months ago. "Things can change . . . very quickly," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The renewed emphasis on pricing represents a dramatic turnabout from the heady days of the housing boom, which peaked in the middle of last year. Bidding wars were common and, in many markets, homeowners simply looked at the last sale and asked for more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's all changed. The National Association of Realtors said this week that the median sales price of existing, or previously owned, homes fell 1.7% to $225,000 in August from a year earlier, the first such drop in 11 years. There's now a 7.5-month supply of existing homes on the market, the most since April 1993.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With so many properties vying for attention, sellers are also looking for creative ways to catch the eye of would-be buyers and their brokers. Some sellers are offering to pay closing costs or provide other incentives. When their 3,500-square-foot carriage house in Exton, Pa., failed to sell this spring, the owners dropped the asking price twice, to $449,000 from $479,000, says Beth Koser, an agent with Prudential Fox &amp;Roach, Realtors. When that didn't do the trick, the couple agreed to offer $10,000 toward closing costs to any buyer or agent who attended an open house within a two-day period. The home sold a few weeks later for $430,000. "The incentive created a sense of urgency," says Ms. Koser. Buyers "saw that the seller was willing to negotiate."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other brokers are using incentives to counter competition from new home builders. In Tampa Bay, Fla., Craig Beggins, president of Century 21 Beggins Enterprises, recently put together a list of 16 incentives homeowners can offer, from paying the mortgage for several months, to outfitting a media room with a big-screen TV, to picking up the cost of day care for some period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another approach is a personal plea. Traci Smith, president of Century 21 Smith &amp;Associates in San Antonio, encourages clients to court prospective buyers with a letter explaining the intangibles that make their home and neighborhood so appealing, such as the fact that the kids on the block trick-or-treat at Halloween together. During the height of the housing boom, some brokers were encouraging the same type of personal notes -- but from buyers eager to get their bid accepted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some brokers are trying to trigger bidding wars by setting an asking price sure to attract attention. Romeo Aurelio Jr., sales manager for Century 21 Hartford Properties, recently listed a small one-bedroom, one-bath fixer-upper in San Francisco's fashionable Noe Valley neighborhood for $650,000, even though he figured the home would sell for $100,000 above that. "If we priced it at $750,000, it was going to sit," Mr. Aurelio explains. "We marketed it aggressively at $650,000 and it generated 20 offers." The house sold this week for $845,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And with more buyers hunting houses online, selling strategies are adapting to the new technology. Michael Gallagher, a financial-services executive, initially listed his four-bedroom house in Shawnee, Kan., at $274,500. When the listing expired, Mr. Gallagher's new broker suggested that he boost the price to $275,000. Within weeks, the home sold for $271,000, $36,000 more than the best previous offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The explanation? Buyers who use the Internet typically search in increments of $5,000 or $25,000, says Kerwin Holloway, a managing broker with Reece &amp;Nichols, a unit of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which handled the sale. At the higher price, Mr. Gallagher's home was likely to turn up in more searches. It also looked like a bargain to someone whose search started at $275,000. At the lower price, it was one of the most expensive homes priced between $250,000 and $275,000. Until recently, brokers had taken their cues from retailers, pricing a home at $199,500 because it seemed like a better deal than one priced at $200,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A property that's not priced properly can languish on the market and get shopworn, says Dan Elsea, president of brokerage services at Real Estate One in the Detroit area. A four-bedroom house in Troy, Mich., has been sitting on the market for 10 months, even though the price has been cut to $349,900 from $394,900, Mr. Elsea says. By contrast, a similar home in the same market sold this month for $360,000, just 23 days after it came to market priced more appropriately at $369,000, he says.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Michael Corkery </div><div>692 words</div><div>26 September 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales continued to decline last month, and the nation's median home price dropped for the first time in more than a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said existing, or previously owned, homes changed hands at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.3 million units in August. That was down 0.5% from July and 12.6% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month's sales decline was steepest for condominiums and cooperatives, with sales down 3.5% from July and 14.5% from August 2005. Sales of single-family homes were unchanged from July but were down 12.3% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Northeast, existing-home sales rose 1.9% last month, while the median price dropped 3.9% from a year earlier. Existing-home sales in the Midwest increased 0.7% last month, and the median price fell 1.1% from a year earlier. In the South, existing-home sales declined 0.8%, while the median home price was down 2.6% from a year ago. Sales in the West dropped 2.3%, while the median price rose 0.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price of an existing home was $225,000 in August, down 1.7% from a year earlier. That was the first year-to-year price decline since 1995 and the second sharpest in the nearly 40 years the data have been collected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices fell faster for condominiums than for single-family homes. In August, the national median price of a single-family home fell 1.7% from a year ago to $225,700. The median price of an existing condominium fell 2.4% from a year earlier to $223,200.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists had been expecting a price correction for some time, after months of slowing sales and an erosion of confidence among home buyers. David Lereah, the National Association of Realtors' chief economist, said the price decline will help the housing market by making homes more affordable and by helping to reduce rising inventories of unsold homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is a sellers' market turning into a buyers' market," Mr. Lereah said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling prices have a flip side. If their homes are worth less, consumers may feel less wealthy and therefore spend less on goods and services, a worrisome trend for the broader economy. "We have to acknowledge that this is a clear risk to the consumer," said Haseeb Ahmed, U.S. economist at J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;Co. In the short term, he said the recent drop in gasoline prices should offset the effect of declining home values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of unsold homes rose 1.5% last month to 3.9 million housing units, a 7.5-month supply at the current sales pace, and the biggest supply since April 1993. The increase was smaller than in July, when inventories rose 3.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists say prices will have to continue to fall before a sizable number of buyers jump back into the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Federal Reserve reported banks and hedge funds boosted their lending to larger borrowers this year, while the percentage of problem loans remained relatively low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a trend the Fed said reflects increased merger-and-acquisition activity, the volume of syndicated credits -- in which three or more lenders team up to make a large loan -- reached $1.9 trillion in the second quarter, up nearly $250 billion, or 15.2%, from a year earlier. The share of problem credits rose to 5.1% from 4.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonbank institutions, such as hedge funds, brokerages and insurance companies, accounted for 14% of all loan commitments in the second quarter, up from 2% 10 years ago. The share of problem credits among nonbank institutions stood at 11.8% as of the second quarter.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the housing market clearly sagging, economists and investors are watching a variety of gauges to get a handle on the severity of the contraction.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the Commerce Department reported that construction starts on new homes dropped 6% in August from July, to an annualized 1.665 million. That "housing starts" figure was about 5% lower than forecast and 20% lower than the year earlier 2.075 million. The month-over-month decline was the sixth one this year and put housing starts at the lowest level in more than three years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government estimates housing starts by surveying a sample of people who have applied for building permits. In places where permits aren't required, the process includes driving around looking for new-home construction.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other gauges track new-home sales, existing-home sales, median house prices and the inventory of unsold homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales for August will be released by the Commerce Department Wednesday, and are expected to be down about 17% from a year ago. July's sales were down 21.6% from a year earlier, to an annualized 1.072 million homes sold.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales figures reflect market trends more quickly than do existing-home statistics. That's because new homes are counted as sold when the contract is signed, and existing homes are counted as sold only when the deal closes, which may be 30 to 60 days later.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales data, coming Monday from the National Association of Realtors, are expected to be down about 13% from August 2005. The annualized rate of 6.33 million existing homes sold in July represented an 11.2% decrease from last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price of existing homes, which is a good indicator of the market's momentum, was $230,000 in July, up 0.9% from the July 2005 price of $228,000, according to the Realtors group. That's smaller than the double-digit year-over-year gains posted in 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some parts of the country, including the Northeast, the Midwest and the West, are reporting falling home prices. The Realtors association has said the national median house price may fall in coming months, although any decline is expected to be limited. August numbers will be announced with the existing-home sales figures Monday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, there's been a spike in the number of existing homes for sale. The Realtors group says 3.86 million homes were on the market last month, up from 2.76 million a year earlier. In addition to reflecting a diminished appetite on the part of buyers, that growing inventory may reflect the unwillingness of sellers to lower their asking prices enough to tempt buyers. With more houses for sale, buyers have less incentive to bid up prices, and home builders have fewer reasons to start construction on more units.   </p>

</div><div class="author">By Rafael Gerena-Morales </div><div>870 words</div><div>20 September 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction starts on new homes plunged last month as builders curtailed production in response to mounting inventory and slowing sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported yesterday that housing starts dropped 6% in August from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.665 million units. That was the fifth decline in construction starts in the past six months and the slowest rate of starts since April 2003. When compared with a year earlier, construction starts were down 19.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weak housing report helped send stocks lower yesterday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 14.09 to 11540.91.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction starts on single-family homes fell 5.9% in August from a month earlier and declined 20.6% from a year earlier, the government report showed. Housing starts for multifamily homes with five or more units fell 8.2% in August from the previous month and declined 16.9% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department report also showed that building permits -- a barometer of future construction activity -- fell 2.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.722 million in August when compared with the month before and were down 21.9% in August from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is "pretty darn clear that . . . we're in a pretty substantial downswing here," said David Seiders, chief economist of the National Association of Home Builders. Developers "can't keep bringing new supply on the market until [home] inventories come down and affordability is restored. The downside risk of [housing] to the real economy should be getting a lot of attention."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday's report on construction starts and building permits comes on the heels of a pessimistic reading on the home-builder association's confidence index, which was released Monday. The index indicated that home builders feel pessimistic about housing-market conditions and are likely to cut construction activity further for the rest of the year. The association reported Monday that its sentiment index for U.S. sales of new, single-family homes fell in September to 30 from 33 in August, indicating that most builders think the housing market is in poor shape. The housing index, compiled by the NAHB and Wells Fargo, was at 65 a year ago. A reading of 50 would indicate builder sentiment was balanced between good and poor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phillip Neuhart, an economic analyst with Wachovia Corp. in Charlotte, N.C., said the pullback in housing-construction activity will likely trim economic growth in the second half by at least 0.5 percentage point. The NAHB's Mr. Seiders said the slowing housing market could shave second-half economic growth by as much as a full percentage point. The 56 economists surveyed in WSJ.com's September survey said they expect economic growth averaging roughly 2.7% during the second half.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid a national housing boom, residential-construction activity contributed at least 0.5 percentage point to economic growth in 2004 and 2005, according to government data. However, a slowing housing market subtracted 0.63 percentage point from economic growth in this year's second quarter. "That's a dramatic swing" from previous years that is likely to worsen, Mr. Neuhart says. In the housing sector, "we expect choppy waters for the rest of the year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, inflation pressures on the producer, or wholesale, level moderated last month -- offering welcome news for the economy. The Labor Department said its producer-price index for finished goods rose a seasonally adjusted 0.1% last month, matching July's increase. Producer prices in August were 3.7% higher than a year earlier, on an unadjusted basis, down from July's year-over-year increase of 4.2%. Core producer prices, excluding food and energy, fell 0.4% in August from a month earlier, in part because of a steep decline in automobile prices. The August decline in core producer prices was the sharpest drop since April 2003 and the second-straight monthly slide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're not going to get these types of [auto-price] declines every month," said Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist at consulting firm MFR Inc. Nonetheless, yesterday's data underscoring a cooling housing market and easing inflation "offer an overall message of comfort to the Fed. There's no incentive for them to do anything right now" with interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Federal Reserve reported yesterday that the total net worth of U.S. households rose 0.1% to $53.33 trillion in the second quarter, marking the 15th consecutive quarterly increase. That was up from the revised first-quarter figure of $53.27 trillion, the Fed said in its quarterly "flow of funds" report. Meanwhile, the Fed reported that U.S. household debt grew at a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 9.1% in the second quarter, as "home-mortgage debt slowed to a single-digit pace for the first time in several years." U.S. household debt grew at a 9.6% annualized rate in the first quarter.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial Sector</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Expands Briskly</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix's rapidly cooling housing market hasn't damped the region's commercial real-estate market. From a new football stadium for the Arizona Cardinals with a design inspired by a desert cactus to more than 16 million square feet of offices, warehouses and retail stores slated to be built in the region this year, the area's commercial sectors are expanding at a brisk pace amid rising rents and falling vacancy rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some 5.3 million square feet of office buildings are scheduled to be built in the region this year, about double the amount delivered in 2005, according to Property &amp;Portfolio Research Inc., a Boston-based research firm. Meanwhile, some 7.4 million square feet of new retail space is to be delivered this year, up 26% from last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commercial growth has been fueled by a continuing surge in population and employment, says Marshall J. Vest, an economist at the Eller College of Management at the University of Arizona. New arrivals first purchase homes, and now are helping to drive demand for places to shop and work, sending rents higher and triggering more commercial projects that previously didn't make sense economically, Mr. Vest says. Over the next five years, office, retail, warehouse and apartment rents are all expected to grow at above-average rates, PPR says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good times for the commercial sector come as the party is quieting for the residential sector. Until recently, Phoenix has been one of the stars of the nation's high-flying housing market. The area's relative affordability, especially in comparison to the pricier California market, has attracted new residents and driven population at an annual rate of 3.3% in recent years -- about threefold the national average -- to nearly four million people, according to Moody's Economy.com, a unit of Moody's Corp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As interest rates have risen, homes are taking two months to sell, instead of days or weeks, says Mr. Vest. The seasonally adjusted median home price has slipped since the first quarter, and residential building permits fell about 35% on a seasonally adjusted annualized basis in June off the recent peak reached in January, he adds. The downshift comes after the area's median home prices soared 78% to $272,200 from 2003 through the second quarter, outpacing the 26.2% rise nationally, according to the National Association of Realtors. "It really was a frenzy and that clearly started changing in mid-2005," says Mr. Vest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The disconnect between the commercial and residential real-estate cycles isn't uncommon, in part because institutional investors that help to drive the commercial side are less immediately affected by interest rates. But the housing market and the related jobs in construction and mortgage financing that it generates are a key component of Phoenix's economy, and some analysts say the economy -- and ultimately the commercial market -- won't be able to sustain its current pace as housing decelerates. Already, job growth has slipped to a year-over-year pace of 5.1% in July from 6.5% in July of 2005, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Still, that's well above the 1.3% national growth rate in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The commercial market is super strong but we do expect the Phoenix market is going to come off of the pure sizzle that it's had," says Hessam Nadji, managing director of research for Marcus &amp;Millichap, a commercial investment brokerage firm based in Encino, Calif. One area that appears to be softening is investors' appetite for apartments purchased for conversion to condos, he adds. Mr. Nadji expects the dollar volume of rental complexes purchased for conversions this year will be lower than the $1.8 billion in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some investors remain confident that pure rental apartments stand to benefit from the current residential trends. Rising interest rates and the disparity between the price of for-sale homes and rental housing has increased demand for Phoenix-area apartments, while the strong population growth continues to bring new prospective tenants to the region, says Tom Garbutt, head of TIAA-CREF Global Real Estate, a unit of the New York-based financial services organization. "We're seeing a lot of people coming back into the rental market," says Mr. Garbutt. TIAA-CREF recently paid an average per-unit price of about $188,000 for nearly 2,200 Phoenix-area apartments that were part of a larger portfolio purchase. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp;Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">INVENTORIES of unsold homes listed on multiple-listing services in 18 major metropolitan areas grew 3.5% in August from July, according to data compiled by ZipRealty Inc. Inventories in the Seattle area were up 6.4% and Dallas were up 0.6%. Because of an error by ZipRealty, an article Tuesday incorrectly reported the increase for the 18 areas as 4.7%, for Seattle as 13% and Dallas as 16%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(WSJ Sept. 14, 2006)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END) </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A continued rise in inventories of unsold homes in August is likely to put more downward pressure on home prices in parts of the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories of homes in 18 large metropolitan areas across the country expanded by 4.7% in August from a month earlier, according to data compiled by ZipRealty Inc., a real-estate brokerage firm based in Emeryville, Calif. The data are based on single-family homes and condos included in local multiple-listing services of homes for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest increases -- 16% in the Dallas area and 13% in Seattle -- came in markets that have been relatively strong recently. A sharp rise in inventories in those areas is likely to help restrain price increases. Other sizable increases came in Orlando, Fla. (8%), San Francisco (6.1%) and Miami (5.6%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 18 metro areas, only two showed lower inventories. Boston was down 1.5% and Washington, D.C., 1.6%. Prices have declined modestly in both areas over the past year. For instance, the median home price in the northern Virginia suburbs of Washington was $459,000 in August, down 8% from a year earlier, according to Metropolitan Regional Information Systems Inc., a data-tracking firm in Rockville, Md. Such price declines are likely causing some people who can't get the price they want to take their homes off the market and wait for a recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales have plunged over the past year in many areas where prices had soared over the preceding five years, notably in California, Florida, Arizona, Massachusetts and the Washington, D.C., area. Many potential buyers are waiting for prices to come down further. The persistent weakness in these markets has prompted many housing experts to say prices will have to decline more to revive sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sellers gradually seem to be realizing that they will have to lower prices, says Patrick Lashinsky, a senior vice president at ZipRealty. "There's finally some realism getting into the picture."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ivy Zelman, a housing analyst at Credit Suisse Group in Cleveland, estimates that prices of newly built homes in San Diego, Sacramento, Calif., Phoenix, northern Virginia and southwest Florida already are down as much as 10% to 15% from a year ago. That estimate includes "concessions" from builders, such as upgraded kitchens or help with closing costs, which are disguised price cuts. But Ms. Zelman still sees more price declines ahead. "We believe that the housing market is still in the early innings of a hard landing that will likely take several years to develop," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the National Association of Realtors, normally very bullish on home prices, now predicts a drop in median prices for the nation as a whole. David Lereah, chief economist for the Realtors, forecasts that prices will decline modestly in the next few months. After that dip, he says, prices are likely to resume rising, but at a slower-than-normal rate. </p>

A sharp rise in inventories in those areas is likely to help restrain price increases. Other sizable increases came in Orlando, Fla. (8%), San Francisco (6.1%) and Miami (5.6%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 18 metro areas, only two showed lower inventories. Boston was down 1.5% and Washington, D.C., 1.6%. Prices have declined modestly in both areas over the past year. For instance, the median home price in the northern Virginia suburbs of Washington was $459,000 in August, down 8% from a year earlier, according to Metropolitan Regional Information Systems Inc., a data-tracking firm in Rockville, Md. Such price declines are likely causing some people who can't get the price they want to take their homes off the market and wait for a recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales have plunged over the past year in many areas where prices had soared over the preceding five years, notably in California, Florida, Arizona, Massachusetts and the Washington, D.C., area. Many potential buyers are waiting for prices to come down further. The persistent weakness in these markets has prompted many housing experts to say prices will have to decline more to revive sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sellers gradually seem to be realizing that they will have to lower prices, says Patrick Lashinsky, a senior vice president at ZipRealty. "There's finally some realism getting into the picture."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ivy Zelman, a housing analyst at Credit Suisse Group in Cleveland, estimates that prices of newly built homes in San Diego, Sacramento, Calif., Phoenix, northern Virginia and southwest Florida already are down as much as 10% to 15% from a year ago. That estimate includes "concessions" from builders, such as upgraded kitchens or help with closing costs, which are disguised price cuts. But Ms. Zelman still sees more price declines ahead. "We believe that the housing market is still in the early innings of a hard landing that will likely take several years to develop," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the National Association of Realtors, normally very bullish on home prices, now predicts a drop in median prices for the nation as a whole. David Lereah, chief economist for the Realtors, forecasts that prices will decline modestly in the next few months. After that dip, he says, prices are likely to resume rising, but at a slower-than-normal rate. </p>
