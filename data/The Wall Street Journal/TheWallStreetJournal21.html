<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five months after three California municipalities spurned a plan to seize mortgages through eminent domain, a number of other communities still struggling to recover from the housing slump are revisiting the gambit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The renewed push again pits the mortgage industry against Mortgage Resolution Partners, a San Francisco firm that has been pushing the plan as a means to help borrowers reduce loan balances in cases where the remaining mortgage payments are more than the homes are worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fight is beginning to spill into the hands of politicians and federal housing officials, with proponents lobbying the White House for support and opponents pressing the Department of Housing and Urban Development for rules to restrict the ability to seize mortgages via eminent domain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six California cities have signed or agreed to sign pacts in recent months to explore the use of eminent domain, though none has yet taken steps to condemn any property. The largest of those cities -- Richmond, a suburb on the northeast of the San Francisco Bay, and El Monte, a suburb 15 miles east of Los Angeles -- are the closest to moving ahead, said MRP Chairman Steven Gluckstern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late Wednesday, the city council of North Las Vegas, Nev., became the latest community to explore the tactic. The council voted to sign an "advisory services" agreement with MRP to explore potential loan seizures. The pact doesn't require the city to do anything for now, but it represents a step toward seizing loans, possibly later this summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eminent domain allows a government to forcibly acquire property that is then reused in a way considered good for the public. Owners of the properties are entitled to compensation, which is usually determined by a court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of tearing down property, MRP is trying to persuade cities to put eminent domain to use to keep people in their homes. The cities would acquire underwater mortgages from investors and cut the loan principal to match the current property value. Then, they would resell the reduced mortgages to new investors, possibly using loans backed by federal agencies, with MRP collecting a fee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Proponents say their plan would help residents shed debt loads that are restraining economic growth. "The opposition, who are acting out of self-interest, are trying to convince people that it's not necessary to solve this problem, that it will go away on its own," Mr. Gluckstern said in an interview. "The problem isn't going away on its own."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics have argued that the turnaround in the housing market is already curing the problem of underwater loans. In North Las Vegas, around 57% of mortgages were underwater at the end of March, down from 76% one year ago, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage investors say the eminent-domain tactic, which targets loans that are current, does nothing to help borrowers who most need help. They also say the program works only if judges assign a price to loans that are below their market value. "What investor in their right mind would ever invest money in a community where you could get wiped out like that?" said David Stevens, chief executive of the Mortgage Bankers Association. "The people who are going to pay the costs for this are the communities duped into this idea."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wade Wagner, who is one of five members of the North Las Vegas city council, was the only official to vote against the measure. "There's just way too many unintended or unforeseen consequences that could happen," he said. "This is not what eminent domain was intended for."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the White House and federal agencies are being drawn into the debate. The Obama administration has shied away from publicly commenting on the idea. Administration officials have said they view the decision on whether to employ the tactic as a local issue, albeit one that raises some concerns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, three Republican lawmakers from Southern California who are opposed to the eminent-domain proposal asked Shaun Donovan, the secretary for Housing and Urban Development, to clarify the administration's position, because seized loans could be refinanced into mortgages backed by the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span>, which is part of HUD. A HUD spokeswoman declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gluckstern, an entrepreneur who hosted the president at his apartment during a 2007 fundraiser, has also reached out to the administration. "As we continue our work in Washington, people listen attentively, and it's my impression they will be supportive if and when we need them to be," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes surged in May to the highest level since late 2009, pushing prices up so quickly that a major real-estate trade group warned about unsustainable gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales rose 4.2% in May from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.2 million, the first time the pace crossed 5 million since November 2009, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Thursday. Existing-home sales peaked in September 2005 at an annual pace of about 7.3 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures, showing rising home prices and contracts closing at a brisk pace, boosted optimism for the housing market and its ability to support the broader economic recovery. Median prices rose 15.4% from a year earlier to $208,000, the highest level since July 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest price gains, amid tight inventories, sparked a rare warning from the Realtors group, which drew criticism during the housing boom for defending the price surges -- effectively stoking further increases -- at the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, the Realtors' chief economist, cautioned Thursday that the recent rise in home prices isn't sustainable given that housing prices are rising at a double-digit pace while Americans' incomes are rising only tepidly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The home-price growth is too fast, and only additional supply from new-home building can moderate future price growth," he said. New-home construction needs to increase by at least 50% "very quickly," he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That may be starting to happen, though slowly. U.S. home builders reported the best conditions in the housing market in June since the mid-2000s boom, according to a survey released earlier this week by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>, a separate trade group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders broke ground on single-family homes at an annual pace of 599,000 in May, up 16.3% from a year earlier, the Commerce Department said this week. Permits for new construction of single-family homes -- a measure of future demand -- reached their highest level in five years, but any improvements are still well below historical highs. Single-family home starts bottomed out near 400,000 in 2009, while economists view a longer-run, equilibrium pace to be about 1.3 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders "are dragging their heels a little bit" with construction, possibly as a way to regain pricing power they lost during the downturn, said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Pierpont Securities</span>. "That's not altogether a bad thing because it means that we're not going to go into this boom-bust-boom cycle, which would inevitably lead to another bust," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's report offered other signs of optimism for the housing market and the overall economic recovery, which is being powered largely on the backs of consumers and an improving housing sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes listed for sale rose for the fourth straight month as the spring selling season got under way. And fewer sales are being forced by banks or homeowners under pressure: The percentage of sales that were distressed properties stood at 18%, the lowest level since the group began tracking the data in October 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While levels are still low, housing is now the strongest part of the economy in growth terms," said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One potential headwind is that mortgage rates have risen sharply since May. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage increased last week to 4.17%, the sixth straight weekly increase, from a low of 3.59% in early May, according to the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though mortgage rates are still very low by historical standards, a sudden increase could make buyers less willing or able to tolerate higher prices.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York developer Gary Barnett has nearly completed construction on one of the most expensive condominium towers in history. Now he is looking to China to back an even larger and taller tower a block away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Barnett, founder of <span class="companylink">Extell Development Co</span>., is in early talks with the state-owned <span class="companylink">Export-Import Bank of China</span> for a loan of about $1 billion to build the soaring condo and hotel skyscraper just south of Manhattan's Central Park, according to people familiar with the discussions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If completed, such a deal would likely be the largest loan for a U.S. real-estate construction project since the property downturn and would give the Chinese bank -- which has a mission of promoting Chinese investments globally -- its first foothold in a U.S. real-estate project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The high-profile building is poised to be the tallest residential tower in the country. With a building-permit application calling for a 1,550-foot-high structure, it would surpass the Empire State Building, a commercial skyscraper, in height. Its architect was the lead designer of the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, and retailer <span class="companylink">Nordstrom Inc</span>. has agreed to put its flagship department store at the base of the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The talks still could fizzle. Two prior deals for large U.S. projects that involved state-run Chinese banks collapsed in more advanced stages of discussion, including a giant housing development in San Francisco that involved home builder <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>. A person familiar with <span class="companylink">Export-Import Bank</span>'s thinking said, "the project is in a good location," but the bank will have to do its own due diligence to determine whether it is "a good project."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any decision may need to take into account the credit squeeze in Chinese interbank lending. That market, where banks lend to one another, has seen rates soar since early this month, pushing up banks' funding costs and causing some to raise lending rates. <span class="companylink">Export-Import Bank</span> was among a host of large Chinese financial institutions to reduce the size of their planned bond offerings in the past two weeks, as the cash squeeze hit investors' demand for such securities. As a result, Chinese banks are expected to become more vigilant in lending money, say Chinese banking executives and analysts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, real-estate professionals in China say more U.S. loans are expected by state-owned lenders like <span class="companylink">Export-Import Bank</span>, which have been on the hunt for North American investments in the past few years. Chinese banks' U.S. branches held $5.3 billion in loans in the first quarter of 2013, up from just $1.5 billion in the first quarter of 2010, according to <span class="companylink">Trepp LLC</span>. Typically, <span class="companylink">Export-Import Bank</span> and others, like the <span class="companylink">China Development Bank</span>, offer relatively low-cost financing for projects that involve Chinese contractors or investors, thereby furthering Chinese investment overseas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Generally, "the Chinese bank will provide the financing on very favorable terms," said Joel Rothstein, an attorney at Paul Hastings LLP who has worked on deals similar to that being proposed for the New York tower. "At the same time, '<span class="companylink">China Inc</span>.' is supported and promoted, as Chinese contractors and construction-material suppliers win high-profile international assignments."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2010, <span class="companylink">Export-Import Bank</span> agreed to finance $2.5 billion of the cost to build a $3.4 billion hotel, casino and resort project in the Bahamas, in which the <span class="companylink">China State Construction Engineering Corp</span>. serves as the contractor -- fitting with the bank's mission to help Chinese companies overseas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project is under construction. <span class="companylink">Export-Import Bank</span> has also financed an energy project in Texas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the same manner, the U.S. subsidiary of the construction company is in talks to be the co-general-contractor on Mr. Barnett's New York tower, along with <span class="companylink">Lend Lease Group</span>, should the bank loan go forward, the people familiar with the deal said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Barnett's turn to the Chinese comes as U.S.-based banks and other lenders are still skittish about making giant construction loans. Financing of $1 billion would likely require multiple banks agreeing to take a piece of the loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New York condo market for new towers aimed at the ultrarich has been especially hot, with contracts flying out the door at new projects, and at prices well above 2007 peak levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developers of 432 Park Ave., a 1,396-foot tower under construction, say they have signed a contract to sell a $95 million unit, which would be a record sales price for a New York apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Barnett, in particular, has been a beneficiary of the trend. His under-construction, 1,004-foot tower, One57, is slated to open later this year. Activity has been brisk -- more than 70% is sold -- and two condos are in contract to sell for more than $90 million each, including one to a group led by investor William Ackman, people familiar with the sales say. Total listing prices for the 92 units top $2 billion.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos and Conor Dougherty </div><div>932 words</div><div>19 June 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising mortgage rates are pushing up the cost of buying a home just as more local markets are seeing prices and sales climb, but economists say that unless rates move substantially higher the increase is unlikely to derail the U.S. housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates have jumped above 4% for the first time in about a year, hitting 4.15% in the first week of June, up from 3.59% five weeks earlier, according to the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>. The rise represents a 15% increase in the cost of borrowing, or around $50 in the average monthly payment on a $192,800 home, the median price of a previously owned home in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers, while not exactly pleased, have so far taken the rising rates in stride. Sarah Milligan, a 35-year-old teacher from Glendale, Ariz., who has been hunting for a house in the $140,000 range, recently got a disappointing call from her mortgage broker: Her prequalified mortgage rate is now over 4% from just below that level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Milligan, who currently rents a three-bedroom house, says the rate increase won't change her decision to buy, but she said it could move up her timing: "I should probably try to get one as soon as I can."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the rise in mortgage rates remains restrained for now, any prohibitive increase could hurt the housing market and the broader economy, which has been buoyed by the real-estate rebound. Already, the recent spike in mortgage rates has produced a sharp drop in refinancing activity, which is much more sensitive to rate increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low mortgage rates have allowed home buyers to absorb the double-digit percentage rise in prices seen in many regions over the past year. A rule of thumb holds that every one-percentage-point increase in mortgage rates makes homes about 10% more expensive for buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The concerns about rising rates are playing out in the stock market. Investors have sent the Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction Index down 7.6% over the past four weeks, compared with a 1% drop for <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But home builders appear to be unfazed. An index measuring builder confidence hit its highest level in seven years during June, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> said Monday. The index rose to a reading of 52, up from 44 in May and the first time since April 2006 that it moved above 50, which indicates more home builders view sales conditions as good rather than poor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists say the home market is well-positioned to keep growing, though they say rising rates could slow the pace of price and sales gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with the recent jump, economists say, mortgage rates are still extremely cheap -- close to half-century lows. Indeed, applications for home loans, while down slightly between early June and early May, are up 14% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An analysis by economists at <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>. shows that if rates hit 6%, homes would still be affordable by historical standards. <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> economists peg that figure at 7% for most parts of the country. The Goldman economists say the recent rise in mortgage rates doesn't change their forecast of 4%-5% annual home price gains over the next few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Rates aren't moving far enough where somebody says, 'I can't get the house I thought I was going to be able to get,' " said Peter Lansing, chief executive of Denver-based Universal Lending Corp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While rates have yet to curb the appetites of buyers such as Arizona's Ms. Milligan, that could change if rates jumped higher. In 1994, the 30-year mortgage rate jumped from 7.1% to 9.2% by the end of the year, shutting down a broad-based housing rebound. An annual home-sales gain of 13% that June became a 7% decline the following May, according to <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics. In 1996, rates rose from 7% to 8.3%, slowing single-family home sales from an annual gain of 11% to a gain of just 3% eight months later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Climbing mortgage rates are one consequence of a sudden rise in Treasury yields in recent weeks, as investors sell off bonds amid concerns that the Federal Reserve will start slowing the bond-buying program it launched last year, which helped push down mortgage rates. Mortgage rates tend to track yields on the 10-year Treasury note. Investors will be watching the Fed, which concludes a two-day policy meeting Wednesday, for any signals about coming policy moves that could have a bearing on the direction of mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bigger concern for housing buyers is that the supply of homes for sale is low, and that is pushing prices out of their range. "Those are much bigger concerns than whether or which side of 4% mortgage rates are sitting at," said Greg McBride, senior mortgage analyst at Bankrate.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take Mike Kennedy, who is also looking for a new home in the Phoenix area. He says rapidly escalating prices have offset whatever gains he hoped to make by getting low interest rates. Phoenix-area home prices are up about 20% from a year ago. "It's nice to have the cheap money, but with the costs of homes going up I'm not sure how much of a great deal it is," he says. "I might have missed the train."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Europe/Asia border region of the Caucasus was misspelled as Caucuses in a Money &amp; Investing article on Wednesday about Donald Trump, who has licensed his name to a real-estate developer in the Caucasus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(WSJ June 20, 2013)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Donald Trump, who first found fame as a real-estate developer, has put his name on mens' fragrance, mattresses and neckties. But there is one type of product he hasn't licensed his name to since the beginning of the financial downturn: a U.S. building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last time Mr. Trump signed a deal licensing his name to a U.S. real-estate project was in 2007, when he agreed to put it on the Trump Soho, a hotel-condo project in downtown Manhattan. He also sold his name to a golf resort in Puerto Rico in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It isn't that Mr. Trump has lost his taste for seeing his name stamped in capital letters on other developers' undertakings. He is just doing it overseas instead. In recent years, Mr. Trump has licensed his name to more than a dozen real-estate developers in Turkey, the Caucuses, Brazil and other corners of the globe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, Mr. Trump is expected to unveil plans for a Trump-branded hotel and condominium tower in downtown Vancouver, British Columbia, according to executives familiar with the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plans for Trump-branded condominiums, resorts and commercial centers also are under way in the Philippines and Azerbaijan. In March, <span class="companylink">Trump Organization</span> opened an office in Shanghai to identify Chinese branding deals for the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trump, 67 years old, says he is focusing his licensing business on projects in other countries because he is less familiar with those real-estate markets. In the U.S., he says he would rather invest money to acquire and develop his own properties -- and put his name on those.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some branding experts suggest Mr. Trump's U.S. hiatus stems at least in part from the patchy record of his previous licensing deals there. Some of those projects ended up in foreclosure or never were completed, prompting lawsuits involving hundreds of condo buyers against the developers, Mr. Trump, or both.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lull in Mr. Trump's U.S. property-branding deals underscores a feature of his business empire, which includes the TV show "The Apprentice," golf courses and real estate throughout the world, in addition to his licensing business. It is built in large part on Mr. Trump's outsize persona.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not even a question of ego. It's just that my name makes everything more successful," Mr. Trump said in a phone interview from his office in Trump Tower, a 68-story skyscraper he developed on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue in the early 1980s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his typical real-estate licensing deals, he sells developers the right to use his name for an upfront fee of between $5 million and $10 million, according to a person familiar with Mr. Trump's business dealings. He also gets a portion of potential future sales, or in the case of hotels, a management contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trump also has sold his brand name for use on steaks, bottled water, flavored vodka, scotch and cuff links.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Branding experts point out that the success of Mr. Trump's brand depends on his image as an ultrawealthy businessman with the Midas touch. "Each time that there's a default or a bankruptcy, it chips away at the value of the Trump name," says James Fox, chief executive of Red Peak Branding, a firm that does brand-strategy work for large firms such as <span class="companylink">Intel Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">American Express Co</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trump-branded projects ran into financial problems during the downturn in cities including Tampa and Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and New York. More recently, in January, a real-estate firm that owned the land that was slated to be the Trump Towers Philadelphia condo complex, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, with a plan to restructure and restart the project. The Trump name also was associated with problems in Atlantic City, N.J., where Trump-branded casinos have filed for bankruptcy protection three times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Marketing Arm, an <span class="companylink">Omnicom Group Inc</span>. unit that tracks celebrity appeal by using online consumer polls, says that in 2008, Mr. Trump was No. 154 on a list of 3,000 celebrities ranked in order of how effective they were as product endorsers. That was on par with actors George Clooney and Clint Eastwood. Today, consumers rate him at No. 2,763, or about as effective at selling products as pop star Britney Spears, the company says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, Mr. Trump hired Jonathan Low, a partner with Predictiv Consulting, a branding firm, to assess the value of the Trump name. Back then, he said it was worth between $2.8 billion and $3.4 billion. Mr. Low said Tuesday that the value of the brand since then "probably hasn't diminished and it may have increased."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trump blames the financial problems that hit Trump-branded projects on the financial downturn and on the developers, and he denies they have hurt his brand in the U.S. He points out that he made money on the branding deals even if the projects ran into trouble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of his licensing deals have been successful. The Trump Tower at City Center in White Plains, in Westchester County, N.Y., sold all 212 of its condo units in less than six months after sales began in 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a hell of a formula," Mr. Trump says. "The brand is so hot. I made millions of dollars, and I was able to skip this really bad market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign developers who have joined with Mr. Trump say his brand is untarnished in their countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Trump is real estate," says Robbie Antonio, the Philippines developer of a Trump-branded condo tower.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BRICK, N.J. -- Tens of thousands of Jersey Shore homeowners are receiving welcome news that they won't have to raise their homes high into the air to comply with new federal floodplain regulations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the shift will have less of an impact on urban dwellers wrestling with how to bring basement apartments up to code in the wake of superstorm Sandy. And coastal scientists argue that homeowners in flood-prone areas should still elevate as high as possible, as the maps don't account for rising sea levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The FEMA maps are not future looking," said Lisa Auermuller, a marine scientist at <span class="companylink">Rutgers University</span>'s Jacques Cousteau National Estuarine Research Reserve. "Being resilient for anything beyond today will require additional building standards."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a presentation by the <span class="companylink">Federal Emergency Management Agency</span> Monday of revised flood maps for four New Jersey counties, large areas previously listed in the riskiest zones were placed in zones with more moderate flooding hazards. The maps document flooding from a storm with a 1% chance of occurring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners no longer in the riskiest zones won't have to elevate as high while rebuilding their damaged residences and possibly avoid lifting their homes onto expensive pilings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm relieved," said Larry Newman, a 47-year-old Brick homeowner whose three-bedroom ranch house was removed from the riskiest zone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elevating a three-bedroom home on pilings can cost $150,000 versus $50,000 to put it on blocks, according to homeowner George Kasimos, who received estimates for his damaged Toms River, N.J., home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FEMA officials said Monday that the amount of land in the riskiest zones had decreased by 80% in Atlantic County, 76% in Hudson, 46% in Monmouth and 45% in Ocean from earlier estimates. FEMA provided the percentage drops in terms of acreage, and couldn't cite the number of individual structures that were in the risk areas Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Brick, in Ocean County, the number of properties in the riskiest zone dropped to about 1,000 from 4,000, said township Mayor Stephen Acropolis. The properties left in the high-risk zone are concentrated along the oceanfront and don't spread to back bays as they had under the previous map, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People are very, very happy," Mr. Acropolis said. "They can move on."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the revised maps show fewer homes in the riskiest zones, the total amount of properties now in floodplains increased since FEMA last issued maps for most of the state in the 1980s. The total land with some flood risk increased by 24% in Monmouth County, 29% in Hudson, around 6% in Ocean and an estimated 20% in Atlantic, FEMA officials said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owners with homes in floodplains must have flood insurance if they have a mortgage and may have to elevate their houses to some degree. Some city homeowners will have to stop using their basements to abide by the new flood maps, while those living in ground-floor spaces are in a particular bind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a major challenge," said Dawn Zimmer, the mayor of Hoboken. The Hudson County city sustained major damage during Sandy and has a significant increase in properties in the floodplain under the new map.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, FEMA released advisory flood maps for New Jersey that had already been under development before Sandy struck. The maps weren't complete at the time of the storm and didn't account for dunes or other structures that could slow a destructive wave from damaging a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gov. Chris Christie chose to adopt the maps in January to help guide homeowners in rebuilding. But many Jersey Shore officials criticized the first new maps for adding so many homes in the highest-risk areas. Many homeowners who weren't previously in the riskiest zones -- some who hadn't sustained serious flooding before Sandy -- said they were left in limbo about whether to elevate their properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The flood maps are a mess," said Mr. Kasimos, who started a group called "Stop FEMA Now" to protest the maps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bill McDonnell, FEMA's mitigation branch director for New Jersey, said the agency released the most complete maps it had at the time to guide homeowners with significant damage looking to rebuild. Moving forward, the maps won't change to any great degree, he said. Mr. McDonnell said FEMA will release maps for other counties when they are available, but didn't give a timeframe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are confident in what we are delivering now is a true depiction of what those zones are and the risk in the area," Mr. McDonnell said during a conference call with reporters Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Jersey law allows the updated maps to be automatically adopted as part of state building code, said Larry Hajna, a spokesman for the state Department of Environmental Protection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many homeowners have waited for the new maps to rebuild. Ocean County's Toms River has issued 34 permits to elevate homes, though the waterfront township had roughly 9,500 properties that sustained some level of damage from Sandy, according to local officials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other homeowners still intend to elevate their homes on pilings despite shifting out of the riskiest zone -- a measure of extra protection that the state supports, Mr. Hajna said. The maps don't account for rising sea levels that could cause serious storms and worse damage in the future, according to coastal scientists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We don't want to go through this again," said Gina Suriano-Guarino, a 43-year-old Brick homeowner who plans to elevate on pilings despite shifting out of the riskiest zone. "It could be 100 years before another storm and it could be 10 years. We don't know."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next month, a major bridge over the Schuylkill River just outside Philadelphia will be declared too unsafe for trains to use. Its wood ties are rotten and officials fear the rails, expanding in the summer sun, will pull the trestle apart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority</span>, or Septa, says the bridge hasn't been fixed because Septa is being required to spend money on a different safety program. The other program is designed to prevent trains from crashing into each other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both goals -- avoiding bridge failures and avoiding train crashes -- are top priorities, Septa says. But Septa argues that basic repairs are its more urgent need.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We could have great signals," says Rich Burnfield, Septa's chief financial officer. "But we might not have safe bridges to run those trains over."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similar complaints are being made nationwide, from New York's sprawling transit system, to the tiny 13-station Rail Runner Express in New Mexico. The rail networks are fighting a federal requirement to install anticrash systems by the end of 2015. They argue their systems are already safe and that the requirement siphons money from repairs. They want Congress to push back the deadline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday the Senate Commerce Committee will hold a hearing on railroad safety, including the progress on installing anticrash gear. Overall, the mandate applies to at least 25 U.S. passenger systems carrying nearly 564 million passengers annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Central to the debate is the delicate matter of putting a dollar value on saving a life. It is an age-old regulatory predicament -- namely, whether or not spending to make one thing safe steers money away from addressing a more serious threat elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The effort to calculate the value of lifesaving is a growing area of research among regulators and economists alike, says Michael Livermore of the Institute for Policy Integrity at New York University's School of Law. The research enables "finer distinctions" about the cost that society is willing to bear to lower risks, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the case of the upgraded train signals, the <span class="companylink">Federal Railroad Administration</span>, which regulates passenger and freight trains, in 2009 put the installation cost at 15 times the economic benefits from prevented accidents. The FRA came to this number by applying a standard government formula.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advocates for the new rules include Deborah Hersman, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board. She draws a parallel to the time when NTSB pushed airlines to add collision-avoidance systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've virtually eliminated midair collisions," Ms. Hersman says. "They said it was too expensive and they couldn't do it. It was mandated, it was implemented, it changed countless lives."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A handful of serious rail crashes -- including a 2008 head-on collision that killed 25 people -- prompted Congress to require the new signals. The FRA says the system could prevent 52 accidents a year, ranging from nonfatal rail-yard mishaps to deadly train crashes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the railroads, "There is always going to be an excuse not to do something that it's going to cost them money," says Allan Moran, whose daughter died in the 2008 crash, which occurred near Los Angeles when a Metrolink commuter train ran a red light.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the new requirements had been in place then, Mr. Moran says, "Our daughter might be alive today."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rail anticrash technology, Positive Train Control or PTC, is designed to automatically stop a train even before it runs a red signal or gets into other dangerous situations. This is an improvement over most current systems, which can warn train operators of danger, and in some cases automatically halt trains, but still allow the possibility of collisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This can lead to human error. In the 2008 Metrolink crash, investigators found the train operator was sending texts around the time he ran the red light.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other parts of the world, including Europe, Japan and China, have PTC-like systems in place. The NTSB says the new systems would have prevented at least 15 accidents since 2005 that killed 50 people and injured 942.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As sure as the sun rises and sets, we will see these collisions occur," the NTSB's Ms. Hersman says. "I think the question that certainly the commuter [railroads] have to ask themselves is: Are they going to be the next Metrolink?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question took on renewed urgency last month. PTC wouldn't have prevented a Metro-North derailment in Connecticut that injured more than 70 people, the NTSB said. But a major freight-train collision in Missouri -- which destroyed a nearby bridge -- likely could have been prevented with the more robust signals, the NTSB said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FRA puts the cost of upgrades at up to $13 billion for passenger and freight railroads. The nation's transit agencies' share for the new signal systems is expected to top $2 billion. Overall, the transit agencies have a backlog of around $12.6 billion for commuter-rail upgrades (as opposed to subway, light-rail or buses), in order to achieve a state of good repair, the <span class="companylink">Federal Transit Administration</span> reported in 2010. The FTA oversees municipal and regional mass-transit systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is tough to draw direct comparisons of train passenger safety to other types of travel, according to the Department of Transportation. For instance, the definition of a travel fatality varies. With automobiles, it is a death from injuries up to 30 days after a crash; for trains it is up to a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">American Public Transportation Association</span>, an industry group, says that, for cars, about 1.4 people died for every 100 million passenger-miles traveled from 2003 through 2008, federal data show. For commuter rail, the figure was 0.06 deaths and for <span class="companylink">Amtrak</span>, 0.03.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall in the past decade, FRA statistics show, 56 passengers and employees have died in incidents on mainline track, not including people or cars struck at grade crossings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trade groups for both freight and passenger railroads have urged lawmakers to push back the 2015 deadline for the new signals. "These are very complex systems," says APTA's Rob Healy. "They're not systems that you can just buy at Radio Shack off the shelf."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Railroad signals vary widely, their complexity determined by the type and speed of the trains they regulate, as well as congestion. Areas without signals are known as "dark territory." On these stretches, thousands of miles of track nationwide, a tower operator keeps a list of trains on the rails, and train operators radio in to ask permission to move ahead. Dark territory even includes some suburban commuter-rail routes such as the eastern reaches of the <span class="companylink">New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority</span>'s <span class="companylink">Long Island Rail Road</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some railroads say they can meet the deadline, including Metrolink and <span class="companylink">Amtrak</span>. On the other hand, Chicago-based Metra, the second-busiest commuter railroad after the LIRR, is already assuming Congress will delay the PTC mandate by three years -- something Congress considered last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Metra recently shifted some $14 million away from its PTC budget to fund repairs instead. A Metra spokesman said the funds would instead be used to make improvements in the rail yards and to fix up aging train stations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York's MTA has said PTC installation costs will grow to at least $750 million and that it is delaying other repairs as a result. For instance, it postponed electrical upgrades along its Harlem Line that would let it run more and longer trains during rush hour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration has shown sympathy to calls for relief. In 2011 a then-adviser to the administration, law professor Cass Sunstein, singled out PTC in a Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing as a rule with costs that are "unambiguously" greater than its benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Executive orders signed by Presidents Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama require federal agencies to perform cost-benefit analyses when imposing some new rules and mandates. For regulations designed to prevent fatalities, that means calculating the economic benefit of preserving a life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past, to calculate the value of saving a life, the government used the value of the wages a person would have been expected to earn over the remainder of a lifetime, says W. Kip Viscusi, a professor at <span class="companylink">Vanderbilt University</span> who consulted with the Reagan administration to overhaul life valuations in the early 1980s. At Mr. Viscusi's urging, the federal government adopted a measurement known as the "value of statistical life," or VSL -- roughly speaking, the amount of money Americans find reasonable to spend for a given reduction in the risk of death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The switch to VSL raised the dollar value on preserving a human life. Among other things, that made costlier safety regulations easier to justify on economic grounds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Agencies I think latched onto this," Mr. Viscusi says. "Not only is it good economics, but it increases their benefits by a factor of 10. So it makes their regulations look more attractive than they otherwise would." The calculation is now a standard part of the cost-benefit analysis that occurs across federal agencies when they issue rules deemed to be "significant" by the Office of Management and Budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To calculate the value of life for a given government regulation, agencies use wage, consumer-purchase and job-safety data to calculate the premium already built into economic data to account for relative riskiness. So economists deduce from people's willingness to pay for safety features -- say, air bags -- how much they value lowering the risk of death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From there, economists extrapolate the VSL, the economic value of saving a single life. Back in 2009, the Department of Transportation put that number at $6 million; today it is calculated at $9.1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Their survey is pretty much on target," Mr. Viscusi says of the DOT's current VSL value. "It's about an order of magnitude larger than what a railroad would pay in a court case if they killed somebody." The balance that must be struck, he says, is that the sums might potentially be spent on "other things that would enhance health more than that expenditure."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Positive train control isn't a new concept, but it gained urgency after Sept. 12, 2008, when a Metrolink train rolled out of the station in Chatsworth, Calif. As it motored ahead, its engineer began texting a friend, investigators found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The train ran a red light and slammed into a freight train. The engineer died, along with two dozen other people. Another 102 were hospitalized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within months, lawmakers led by Democratic Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, both of California, focused on technology that could have prevented the accident -- PTC. In 2008, former President George W. Bush signed a law requiring railroads to install the systems by the end of 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Metrolink is one of PTC's strongest backers. "Every year it gets delayed or not put in, someone dies who did not have to," says Richard Katz, Metrolink's board chairman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other railroads say that even though their existing systems don't meet PTC standards, an accident like Chatsworth wouldn't have occurred on their lines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't ever want to paint anything as perfect," said Howard Permut, president of the MTA's Metro-North rail line, in an interview several months before the railroad's May 17 derailment in Connecticut, which is believed to be the result of a broken rail joint. "There's always human error. Things happen." But the MTA's current system, he said, "has been proven to be an extremely safe system."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regarding his railroad's May 17 crash, he says, "It was a very tragic event, but it would not have been prevented by PTC." He notes the NTSB has affirmed that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and others point to a key difference between Metrolink's original signal system and theirs. In Chatsworth, Metrolink's signals worked properly: A red signal warned of the approaching freight train. But the system contained no fail-safe to slow or halt the Metrolink train when it barreled through the red signal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such an accident would be virtually impossible on some of the busiest commuter-rail lines, including Metro-North, and large sections of LIRR, Metra and Septa's territory, executives from those lines say. Already, they say, their current systems will trigger brakes or cut train power on much of their track if trains don't respond to alarms or ignore red signals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But these systems aren't as aggressive as PTC, and they aren't necessarily systemwide. And collisions -- in sections without those fail-safes -- still occur. Of the 15 crashes since 2005 that PTC could have prevented, according to NTSB, one was a 2005 Metra crash that killed two and injured 117 when an engineer improperly interpreted a signal. In 2006, two Septa trains collided, injuring 38, when an engineer disobeyed a signal and failed to stop his train in time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The engineers couldn't be reached for comment. A union representing the two men declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Pennsylvania, passengers on the route affected by next month's Schuylkill River bridge closure are bracing themselves. Sarah Pantelidou says she will probably drive to work more often. Deferred maintenance "made financial sense for Septa, I assume," she says. "But this day was going to come."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders stepped up construction of apartment buildings in May and prepared to boost construction of single-family homes, the latest signs that an improving housing market will support the shaky U.S. recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall housing starts rose 6.8% in May from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 914,000 units, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. That level was nearly 29% higher from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase was driven almost entirely by a 24.9% surge in construction of multifamily units, such as apartments, which are benefiting from high demand from many consumers—such as those with weaker credit—opting to rent instead of buy. New starts on single-family homes, meanwhile, rose a slight 0.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report indicated builders are ramping up for an increase in construction of single-family homes in future months. Building permits for single-family homes, a measure of future demand, rose by 1.3% last month to the highest level since May 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report Monday by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> showed that builders' confidence in home-sales conditions surged this month to levels not seen since the mid-2000s housing boom. Low inventory of existing homes appears to be pushing up demand for newly built structures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The permit activity and the confidence numbers suggest builders want to build," said Jed Kolko, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, an online real-estate site. "I think we will see construction start to rise in coming months."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kolko noted that prior increases in permits haven't always led to increases in construction. Many builders say they face hurdles after getting permits, including zoning regulations, available infrastructure, and rising costs for material and labor. The industry is also concerned that a further increase in mortgage-interest rates from historic lows could crimp sales later this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the report is the latest sign that the housing market is making steady gains, boosting the U.S. economy at a time when other segments—such as government spending and manufacturing—are suffering. Home construction provides a big boost to the economy because it benefits a range of jobs—including companies that sell building materials, carpenters and electricians, and home-appliance stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing is benefiting right now from low interest rates and prices that, while rising, are below their peak. Tight inventories of existing homes is likely one factor behind the pickup in construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even with the recent pickup, housing construction is below its historical average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home construction surged in the middle of the last decade, exceeding 2 million units a year at its height. In 2009, at the low point, the pace of home construction fell below 500,000.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—U.S. home builders reported the best conditions in the housing market since the mid-2000s boom, the latest sign home sales are becoming more robust and will power the U.S. economy this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>, an industry trade group, said Monday that its housing-market index leapt to a reading of 52 in June, up by eight points from May. The jump was the biggest since the summer 2002.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reading marked the first time since April 2006 that the index registered a reading over 50, which indicates most home builders view sales conditions as good rather than poor. The reading was far above economists' expectations of a 45-point measure for June. The index was based on a survey of 255 builders in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Surpassing this important benchmark reflects the fact that builders are seeing better market conditions as demand for new homes increases," said NAHB Chairman Rick Judson, a home builder and developer from Charlotte, N.C. "With the low inventory of existing homes, an increasing number of buyers are gravitating toward new homes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home building is an important driver of the economy, adding to overall growth every quarter since the middle of 2011. Not only does the industry provide a steady source of employment, but Americans who buy new homes also then stock them with appliances, furnishings and other goods, which aids retailers and manufacturers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales, according to separate government data, have stayed near five-year highs through the first four months of the year. That's a strong indication Americans are growing optimistic about the economy and are increasingly willing to make a large investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the industry is facing headwinds. Interest rates have risen for six consecutive weeks, making mortgages more expensive. Rates on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage were more than a quarter-percentage point higher last week than a year earlier, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising rates are tied to investors' concerns that the Federal Reserve will begin to ease up on stimulus measures later this year. The Fed is buying $85 billion per month in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities. The program has helped push rates on home loans to historic lows. Fed policy makers are meeting this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with the June increase, the home builder's index is far below all-time highs. In the late 1990s and in 2004 and 2005, the readings were often in the 60s and 70s. They crashed into the single digits during the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regionally, builder confidence is highest in the Midwest this month. Conditions in the Northeast, however, are still viewed as 'poor', the only area of the country with a sub-50 reading.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Molly Hensley-Clancy </div><div>1020 words</div><div>17 June 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A22</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan's Sixth Avenue used to command some of the highest office rents in the city thanks to the appeal of its hulking towers to big-name companies like <span class="companylink">Exxon Mobil Corp</span>., <span class="companylink">J.C. Penney Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Time Warner Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But these days Sixth Avenue is getting hit by a double-whammy. On one hand, expanding technology companies are the biggest source of growth in the office market and these companies favor older buildings and hip neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, Sixth Avenue has seen about a half-dozen big blocks of space come on the market from tenants moving, contracting or failing. More than 780,000 square feet of office space is available for sublease along Sixth Avenue, according to real-estate information firm <span class="companylink">CoStar Group Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result: Rents on Sixth Avenue are anemic and vacancy is on the rise. That's good news for tenants looking for bargains, but worrisome for owners, especially for those who have made big investments in the area recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Large contingencies of sublease availability will, in general, drag down rents nearby," says Noam Shahar, research director at CompStak, a New York firm that tracks office leases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strongest evidence of weak rents came recently with the efforts by AXA Equitable to sublease roughly 300,000 square feet in the 2-million-square-foot office tower at 1290 Sixth Ave. The financial-services giant, which was represented by <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>, filled all the space by doing deals with tenants including <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>, <span class="companylink">Sirius XM Radio</span> and <span class="companylink">Remy Cointreau</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the rents those tenants are paying are in the mid-$40-a-square-foot range, according to CompStak. That's well below what AXA is paying in rent, $88 a square foot, according to statements made by the building's owner, <span class="companylink">Vornado Realty Trust</span>, earlier this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the reason for the wide disparity is simply that rents overall have fallen since 2007, when Vornado cut its rent deal with AXA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But broader market statistics also don't bode well for Sixth Avenue. Overall the "availability" rate in the Sixth Avenue-Rockefeller Center market increased to over 14% in the first quarter of 2013, up from just over 10% in the first quarter of 2012, according to <span class="companylink">CBRE Group Inc</span>. That rate includes vacancy and space coming on the market in the next 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tenants that are benefiting from this trend include law firm Zeichner Ellman &amp; Krause, which subleased 42,000 square feet at 1211 Sixth Ave. from <span class="companylink">Ropes &amp; Gray</span>. Zeichner Ellman is paying rent in the low-$50-a-square-foot range, well below the rent in the high-$60-a-square-foot range that <span class="companylink">Ropes &amp; Gray</span> is paying, according to CompStak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three blocks to the north, at 1271 Sixth Ave., Sandow Media is subleasing 40,000 square feet of space for 35% below market price, according to <span class="companylink">Newmark Grubb Knight Frank</span>, which brokered the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, in Midtown South, the neighborhood of choice for many technology companies, the picture is a lot different. In the first quarter, average rents increased 9%, passing the $60 threshold for the first time, according to CBRE.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tenants subleasing space might actually able to make money instead of suffer losses as they are in Midtown. Michael Plavin, a vice president of commercial real-estate firm Cresa, says the profit could be as much as $15 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the towers along Sixth Avenue between 42nd and 57th streets were developed in the 1960s and 1970s during an era in which New York architects favored towers set back on spacious public plazas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The towers -- which also included 1251 Sixth Ave. and 1301 Sixth Ave. -- were filled with some of the country's largest corporations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the original tenants along Sixth Avenue, including Exxon and <span class="companylink">J.C. Penney</span>, moved out. While they were replaced by others, the architecture along Sixth fell into disfavor, with the towers seen as sterile and inimical to street life. Today city zoning rules discourage such towers from being built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, the value of office towers on Sixth Avenue today remains strong along with other trophy Manhattan properties. For example, Montreal-based <span class="companylink">Ivanhoe Cambridge Inc</span>. and a partner recently agreed to purchase a 49% stake in 1211 Sixth Ave. in a deal that values the Manhattan office tower at about $1.75 billion, according to multiple real-estate executives with knowledge of the deal. The building is home to The Wall Street Journal and its parent News Corp., which occupies about half the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But these high values are being driven primarily by investors seeking yields in a low-interest rate environment. Rents and occupancy rates in Manhattan are still far from pre-bust levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the tenants recently departing the Sixth Avenue area include French <span class="companylink">bank Societe Generale</span>, which left the <span class="companylink">McGraw-Hill</span> building at 1221 Sixth Ave. for Park Avenue, vacating more than 500,000 square feet of space. Also, law firm <span class="companylink">Dewey &amp; LeBoeuf</span> vacated 470,000 square feet at 1301 Sixth Ave. -- the old <span class="companylink">J.C. Penney</span> headquarters building -- after declaring bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Large space availability on Sixth Avenue could spell trouble for developers like New York-based RXR Realty, which took a gamble when the company signed a 99-year lease for 75 Rockefeller Plaza. The 33-story tower will be completely empty in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the company's executive vice president, William Elder, is bullish about the market on Sixth Avenue, which he predicts will get tighter in the coming year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He points to the AXA Equitable subleases as a sign of strength because the company succeeded in finding tenants for all of its sublease space in a short of amount of time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People jumped on the opportunity and that space is all gone," says Mr. Elder. "That's a good sign."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lot of the available space in the area "is not a bad thing," he adds. "It gives larger tenants choices to locate on a great avenue."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest question in New York's commercial real-estate industry last week was what was behind Cushman &amp; Wakefield's surprise announcement that Glenn Rufrano was stepping down as chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the company and Mr. Rufrano remain circumspect, the answer seems to reflect what's going on at Cushman's parent company, <span class="companylink">Exor SpA</span> of Italy, as much as it shows what's happening at the storied New York-based real-estate firm. Exor, a huge investment company that also owns a controlling stake in <span class="companylink">Fiat SpA</span>, acquired a 67.5% stake in Cushman for $563 million in 2006 and since then has increased its ownership to 72%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Up until last week, the relationship between Exor and Mr. Rufrano seemed to be solid. Exor hired Mr. Rufrano, a turnaround expert, to run Cushman &amp; Wakefield in 2010 and backed him as he expanded the company globally. The parent company allowed Mr. Rufrano to reinvest profits along the way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This strategy seems to have worked as the real-estate industry recovered from the downturn. Cushman had $79.1 million of operating income in 2012, up from $64.5 million in 2011, according to an Exor filing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Exor has other concerns besides Cushman. As these other pressures mounted, Exor called on Cushman to pay the parent dividends rather than reinvesting the money into the business. That set the stage for Mr. Rufrano's departure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The parent's biggest concern lately has been Fiat's desire to purchase the 41.5% stake it doesn't already own in <span class="companylink">Chrysler Group LLC</span>. Indeed, Fiat suspended its dividend earlier this year partly because it wanted to conserve cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exor itself has been raising cash partly by selling assets. For example, earlier this month, Exor said it was selling its 15% stake in Swiss inspection company <span class="companylink">SGS SA</span> for $2.6 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As far as Cushman goes, it started paying Exor a dividend this year. Exor pointed out in a statement that a large amount of the company's earnings over the last three years has been "re-invested in the business" and that Exor expects "rigorous capital discipline" from the management teams of its companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some might argue that Cushman can't afford to pay Exor dividends in today's competitive environment. Despite its progress, Cushman still has a long way to go to close the gap globally with rivals <span class="companylink">CBRE Group Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, analysts say CBRE and Jones Lang have been growing faster than Cushman because they have larger presences around the world. They've also done well at building businesses that aren't dependent on sales and leasing commissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In 2012, Cushman didn't grow as quickly partly because of the greater global bandwidth of those two organizations," says William Marks, an analyst who follows real-estate companies for <span class="companylink">JMP Securities</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's possible Mr. Rufrano is leaving because Exor isn't happy with his performance. But that's unlikely given that Cushman's improved earnings have boosted its value to between $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion, according to an estimate by Mr. Marks. That's well above Exor's investment including how much it paid for Cushman and the capital it invested subsequently, Mr. Marks says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rufrano's predecessor, Bruce Mosler, served as Cushman's chief executive between 2005 and 2010, and is now one of the top brokers at the firm. The post was filled from 1984 to 2004 by Arthur Mirante II, who left Cushman last year to head <span class="companylink">Avison Young</span>'s New York regional office. Mr. Rufrano signed a five-year contract when he joined the company, but it was more recently converted to a year-to-year contract as part of a companywide change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Mr. Rufrano gone, Cushman is now being run by Carlo Barel di Sant'Albano, the company's charismatic executive chairman, who has taken over as Mr. Rufrano's job on an interim basis. Mr. Sant'Albano was chief executive of Exor when it decided to buy its controlling stake of Cushman and has been increasingly involved ever since.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sant'Albano said in an interview last week that he and Mr. Rufrano have been discussing Mr. Rufrano's possible departure "over several months." He says he can't recall whether he or Mr. Rufrano first brought up the subject and that his departure was a "mutual decision."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rufrano agreed with the assessment. "I would never say 'I'm leaving' and they would never say 'Go,'" he said in an interview. "We both understood that there are different adventures in life that would work out."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for who's next, Cushman has set up a four-person search committee. Mr. Sant'Albano said the search will take place "over several months" but the company is in "no rush" partly because he knows the business so well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Marks suggested that Exor would look for someone with a background in global real estate: "Becoming a one-stop international shop has become vital."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That raises the possibility that Mr. Sant'Albano might end up with the job permanently. A former trader at Drexel Burnham Lambert, he has a good reputation both within the firm and in the industry. He took the job of executive chairman at Cushman in 2011 when John Elkann became chief executive of Exor. Last year, Mr. Sant'Albano took on more day-to-day responsibilities at Cushman by also taking on the role of chief executive of the firm's European, Middle East and Africa division.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he said he's not likely to stay on as CEO of Cushman. "I'm used as a troubleshooter," he said. "That's a better role than giving up the role of chairman and being CEO."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anya Martin </div><div>740 words</div><div>14 June 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has been a good year so far -- the stock market is surging, real estate is rebounding and interest rates remain low. But some luxury homeowners are still falling behind on their jumbo-mortgage payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When that happens, lenders are typically willing to offer borrowers relief by deferring some payments -- the official term is forbearance. Jumbo mortgages, defined as above $417,000 in most of the nation and $625,500 in some high-price markets, aren't backed by the government. Instead, most lenders hold the loans on their books -- giving them an incentive to work with borrowers in distress to avert foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Generally in forbearance, the lender agrees to suspend a portion of, or all of, a borrower's monthly mortgage payments for a set period. In exchange, the borrower agrees to a formal plan to repay the deficit either through higher monthly payments or an extension at the end of loan term. There are no late-payment fees, and the loan's interest rates usually remain the same. Forbearance typically doesn't affect credit scores, assuming the borrower is current with other financial obligations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At San Francisco-based <span class="companylink">Bank of the West</span>, where a fourth of all mortgages are jumbos, fewer borrowers are in distress now than in recent years, said Stewart Larsen, who manages the bank's mortgage-banking division. When payments lag, the top reasons continue to be job loss and instability in self-employment income, Mr. Larsen added. Other reasons include a health crisis or divorce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, only 7.25% of all mortgage loans, jumbo and conforming, on one- to four-unit residential properties had at least one past-due payment at the end of the first quarter of 2013, according to the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span> national delinquency survey. That amount doesn't include loans in foreclosure and is adjusted for seasonal effects, and it reflects a 15-basis-point improvement compared with a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only 0.7% of loans had foreclosure actions started in the quarter, the lowest level since the second quarter of 2007 and a 26-basis-point improvement from early 2012, MBA data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While improvements can be attributed to a stronger economy, tightened loan-qualification standards also have played a role, Mr. Larsen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because lenders generally keep jumbo loans in their portfolios, a default can have a greater impact, especially on a smaller community bank. Banks have their own programs for jumbo-mortgage holders, and these are typically customized to the borrower's particular loan and circumstances, said Rick Simon, a <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> spokesman. "We advise any homeowner who is about to experience short- or long-term financial difficulties to call their mortgage servicer," he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key is to contact your lender and explain your hardship situation as early as possible, especially for larger loans, Mr. Larsen said. "If it's really a temporary situation, it can be very simple," he added. "We'll verify the issue and ask you to fill out a few forms."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally after a natural disaster or other emergency, lenders may launch special deferment programs for borrowers hurt by the event. For example, Chase announced a 90-day payment moratorium for borrowers affected by the Moore, Okla., tornado, said Amy Bonitatibus, a Chase spokeswoman. Chase doesn't report missed payments to credit agencies during a moratorium, Ms. Bonitatibus added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other issues when considering forbearance:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Keep track of your credit score. Ask how the lender plans to report reduced or deferred payments to credit agencies. If no payments are due during the forbearance period, credit-agency guidelines ask lenders to report the loan as current, according to Equifax Data Services. Payments mistakenly flagged as past due during the forbearance period can remain on a credit report for seven years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Look for other ways to cut expenses. Mortgage payments may not be the only way to cut monthly costs, said Anna Cuevas, author of "Save Your Home Without Losing Your Mind or Your Money." Review other monthly expenses, property values/taxes and homeowner's insurance premiums to find other ways to save.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Consider whether a deferment is enough. Borrowers may wish to use a forbearance period as an opportunity to pursue a refinance or loan modification to lower their interest rate and reduce payments for the life of the loan, Ms. Cuevas said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Amir Efrati </div><div>873 words</div><div>13 June 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A13A</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices of Bay Area homes are climbing quickly, but not as fast as the value of Bay Area technology companies that help people search for homes online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, for instance, the share prices of real-estate Web-search companies <span class="companylink">Trulia Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Move Inc</span>., both with headquarters in the Bay Area, have surged nearly 90% and 60%, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of Seattle-based <span class="companylink">Zillow Inc</span>., the most-visited online home-search service, are up 90%. And Seattle-based <span class="companylink">Redfin Corp</span>., an online real-estate brokerage that is trying to disrupt the commission-based pay model for agents, says it is gearing up for an initial public offering as soon as next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the recent stock run-up, the companies have had their ups and downs, along with the real-state market itself. Three of the top four real-estate-technology companies -- <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, Zillow and Redfin -- grew up during the last housing bubble and weathered the downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It hasn't been a straight ride," said Pete Flint, the 38-year-old chief executive of San Francisco-based <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, which launched in 2005 and went public last September. "It's a little bit like we've been swimming upstream for the last seven years and suddenly the tide has changed," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Market researchers take different views of the companies' prospects. Some stock analysts say the rise this year is justified and that there are more fundamentals backing the surge than the housing recovery taking place in many parts of the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More broadly, the companies say they are seeing a jump in the amount of time people spend on the Web researching real estate, rentals and home-improvement projects before making purchase decisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most real-estate sites generate revenue through ads bought by real-estate agents, lenders and others. The CEOs of all the companies -- which allow people to quickly contact those advertisers while they are house shopping -- say the rise of smartphones has boosted their businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as Web companies helped transform the travel and job-recruiting industries and several became multibillion-dollar businesses, stock investors expect the same thing to happen in real estate. The current contenders are relatively small, with market capitalizations of just $500 million to $1.5 billion for the top three.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The companies are fighting for a greater share of the expected $21.3 billion in U.S. advertising spending by real-estate agents, mortgage lenders, home builders and rental-property managers this year, up from $19.2 billion in 2012, according to research firm Borrell Associates. About 65% of this year's spending, or $13.8 billion, will be online, up from $11.7 billion last year, the firm said. Other top ad-spending avenues are print publications and television.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One challenge for growth is competition. Borrell Associates CEO Gordon Borrell says there isn't a big "rising tide" lifting those companies, given that most real-estate ad spending is already online, scattered across thousands of sites. "Online marketing is a highly fragmented industry. The barriers to entry are low," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says a lot of small firms are trying to break in, and the industry leaders will have an easier time growing through acquisitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the M&amp;A machine is cranking up. Last month, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> announced what it said was the largest-ever acquisition in the online residential real-estate market, agreeing to pay $355 million for a company called Market Leader that provides software tools for real-estate agents, mortgage brokers and others to manage leads and contacts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, which has 550 employees, will add 280 workers when the Market Leader deal closes later this year. <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> is barely profitable but has consistently beaten analysts' quarterly revenue estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For its part, Zillow has acquired six companies since 2011, the year it went public. Three of the deals were for San Francisco-based rental-property-related sites, where 60 of Zillow's 700 employees now work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I tell people, 'You want to really make money? Go out and start an online real-estate app,'" said Mark Mahaney, a stock analyst at <span class="companylink">RBC Capital Markets</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some startups are trying to simplify the notoriously complicated real-estate buying-and-selling process. San Francisco-based startup Amitree Inc. earlier this year launched Closing Time, a Web program that organizes paperwork for buyers and agents to ease the loan-closing process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Web industry is "waking up to the fact that real estate is still in the stone age technologically and that it presents a big opportunity," says Paul Knegten, a co-founder of Amitree.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Jose-based Move, which operates the 17-year-old Realtor.com and has ties to the National Association of Realtors, is growing more slowly than its main competitors and also has revved up acquisitions, buying two companies late last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Move CEO Steve Berkowitz says the "euphoria around the real-estate business. . .hasn't extended to us," referring to his company's "reasonable" but lower price-to-earnings ratio compared with those of Zillow and <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I like the position we're in -- as an underdog," he says.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Chao Deng and Esther Fung </div><div>769 words</div><div>12 June 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHANGHAI -- Larry Silverstein, best known for his role in rebuilding New York's World Trade Center, is close to moving forward with his first major project in China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Silverstein said he is completing a deal with a local partner and the local government on plans for a large mixed-use project in a part of the southern boomtown of Shenzhen that authorities hope will become a global services center. The project would include a mass-transit center and just under five million square feet of office space, retail outlets and a hotel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Silverstein also is looking at possible projects in Shanghai and Beijing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Silverstein Properties</span>' efforts in the country come as a cooling economy and poor planning have left a number of Chinese shopping malls, as well as entire residential and office communities, unoccupied -- the so-called "ghost town" phenomenon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Silverstein said he wasn't concerned about the situation, which he said was temporary and only occurred in isolated instances. Demand will "be there tomorrow [if] not there today," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With a [Chinese] population of 1.35 billion people, the level of stability here will be able to sustain the developmental activity that you see happening all around us," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For decades, Mr. Silverstein focused primarily on New York. His company has been expanding into other countries since 2010, when Mr. Silverstein recruited real-estate executive Martin Burger, who is set to succeed him as chief executive of Silverstein Properties later this year. Mr. Silverstein, 82 years old, will remain chairman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign interest in China's property sector has risen in 2013, according to data provider Dealogic. Such investment totals $2.46 billion year to date, the data provider said, more than double the $1.13 billion during the same period last year. The figures exclude a number of smaller deals, Dealogic said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some foreign investors have a successful track record in China. In 1990, Atlanta-based Portman Holdings, one of the earliest U.S. developers to expand in China, built the Shanghai Center, a mixed-use project that includes the Portman Ritz-Carlton Hotel, offices, retail space and apartments. The company currently is building a residential and retail project in Shanghai called Portman House Jian Ye Li, a historical-preservation project backed by the local government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts have warned of a rising supply of office space slated to hit the market in second-tier cities, especially in Tianjin. Late last year, <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> analysts warned of a glut of malls in Shenyang and Zhengzhou.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some investors and developers that have dealt with slowdowns in their domestic markets or have underestimated the difficulties of operating in China, have scaled back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Montreal-based <span class="companylink">Ivanhoe Cambridge</span>, which owns a stake in a shopping mall in Changsha in Hunan province, said in January it is reducing its team in China. The firm said it wants to be less involved in on-the-ground property management, but still wants to do investment deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others are dipping back in. <span class="companylink">Simon Property Group Inc</span>., the largest U.S. mall owner, pulled back in 2009 amid the financial crisis, industry watchers said. But the company in March said that together with Chinese retail conglomerate Bailian Group, it would develop an outlet center in Shanghai's Pudong area. A spokesperson for Simon declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Silverstein Properties</span> has been trying to break into the Chinese market for several years. In January 2011, it established a joint venture in the western Chinese city Chongqing with local players China Bridge Capital and state-owned Jiangbeizui Central Business District Investment &amp; Development Co. The joint venture made an unsuccessful bid for a land parcel there. The local authorities sold the land to a higher bidder, a staff member from <span class="companylink">Silverstein Properties</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Silverstein led a group that signed a 99-year lease for the World Trade Center less than two months before the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack. For years he battled with insurers and government agencies over the rebuilding. Mr. Silverstein now has one office tower nearing completion and another two planned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Silverstein first visited China in 1993 and said he has dreamed of developing there during subsequent trips in the late 1990s. He said he hopes to see progress within the next few years. It is "critically important to me," Mr. Silverstein said, "especially since I'm 82."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos </div><div>831 words</div><div>10 June 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing-market recovery is here but there's a growing debate among bulls and bears over how long it will last and how strong it will become, with both groups pointing in part to the same data to make their case: U.S. demographics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bull case says the housing market is in the early stages of a rebound that should last several years because the U.S. hasn't built enough housing to support the country's growth. The recession and the foreclosure crisis led to a sharp slump in new-home construction and in household formation. But the population didn't stop growing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bears argue that the recent gains in housing will be short-lived, pointing to changes in access to credit, elevated consumer-debt levels, and an over-reliance on investors. They don't believe housing will crash again. But they see little evidence that the price or sales momentum is durable or that housing will provide the big boost to the economy that the bulls are expecting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For anyone considering whether to buy a home to live in, the decision should focus primarily on whether they can afford the payments and other costs of ownership, regardless of where home prices go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slump's impact set up today's dynamics. The country added around 1.3 million new households every year for the 10-year period ending in 2007, after which household formation fell to more than half that level. New-home construction ground to a halt in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing bulls see the slow economic recovery releasing pent-up demand, first for rental housing and then for home purchases. More young adults -- many of them among the 65 million "echo" boomers born to baby boomers between 1981 and 1995 -- are moving out of their parents' homes and into apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, bulls still see too few homes being built. Population growth will require 14 million additional housing units this decade, around three-quarters of them single-family homes, according to Zelman &amp; Associates, a research and advisory firm. Analysts at Zelman estimate that only 5.7 million of those units will be built by 2015, meaning the U.S. would need to add two million homes a year over the last four years of the decade -- spurring a big boost of construction that would ripple through the economy. "There's just not enough shelter," says Ivy Zelman, the firm's chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Zelman, who was early to warn that the housing sector was cooling in 2006, says record affordability, fueled by low prices and mortgage rates, is only part of the reason housing has picked up today. Equally important is that home prices have stopped falling, convincing consumers that they're no longer at risk of catching a falling knife. Investors have played key roles by picking up the slack for debt-constrained consumers and by converting homes from the oversupplied for-sale market into rentals, where there has been a shortage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bear case, the outlines of which are laid out in a forthcoming paper by Joshua Rosner, managing director of Graham Fisher &amp; Co., draws attention to several forces that had helped housing -- and the economy -- expand over the past few decades but whose end will now hinder growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rosner first highlights the end of the "democratization" of credit. On the way up, lenders extended loans on better terms to more borrowers during a period in which interest rates were also declining. That allowed more Americans to become homeowners and, later, to take cash out of those homes via home-equity loans. Housing and consumption enjoyed a one-time boost as baby boomers moved from one-income to two-income households during the inflation spells of the 1970s and as those consumers entered their peak consumption years in the 1980s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, those tailwinds are becoming headwinds, Mr. Rosner says. The democratization of credit ended during the bust, and a new period of much tighter credit standards has replaced it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tight credit isn't the only problem, argue the bears. Many Americans will face trouble qualifying for loans because they have too much debt relative to incomes that aren't growing fast -- particularly first-time buyers from the "echo" boom who have taken on heavy student-debt loads over the past decade. All of this is likely to unfold in a rising-interest-rate environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Skeptics also haven't taken comfort in the housing rebound because they see it as too dependent on investors. "We shouldn't look at it as a fundamentally recovered housing market," says Mr. Rosner. Sooner or later, he says, there needs to be "a handoff from the investor purchase to the primary-resident purchase."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How that handoff unfolds will go a long way toward deciding whether the bulls or the bears have the last laugh.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Double-digit home-price gains from San Francisco to Detroit to Miami have some aspiring home buyers racing back into the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But buyers, beware.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market may not be as strong as you think.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure it's tempting to want to lock in a low interest rate and take advantage of lower home prices before they rise further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it may make sense to take a breather before you buy a home and wait for prices to drop, as institutional investors might be inflating home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Namely, Wall Street investors are scooping up homes in bulk, and there's considerable concern this is inflating prices in certain areas of the country—and pricing individuals out of the market in general.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These institutional investors have been spending billions of dollars buying up single-family homes en masse. In 2012, institutional buyers purchased about 138,540 of both distressed and non-distressed homes in the U.S., or about 3% of all sales, according to RealtyTrac. It estimates institutional buyers purchased 32,355 homes in the U.S. in the first quarter of this year, or about 3.5% of home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That may sound like a small amount of purchases, but in certain markets institutional investors are taking a larger stake. For example, institutional buyers accounted for 5% and 8% of sales in Arizona and Nevada, respectively, so far this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And some of the hottest markets for big corporate buyers from 2010-2012 are seeing some of the biggest price jumps this year—Phoenix, Las Vegas, the San Franciso Bay Area, portions of Florida and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are concerns we may be headed for another bubble in areas where housing-price gains may not be sustainable, especially if unemployment remains high, interest rates start rising, selling prices peak and investors quickly unload their holdings in bulk, depressing home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'd discourage a client from buying in an area with a lot of institutional action in that there might be some uncertainty as to the institutions' plans with the property," says Brian Frederick, a financial planner in Scottsdale, Ariz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Add in a small supply of homes for sale—thanks in part to regulations that limit the pace of foreclosure sales and underwater sellers who owe more on their mortgages than their houses are worth and are holding out for even better prices—along with pent-up demand from people who have been waiting to move until they've felt more economically secure and tight lending standards—and you've got the makings of some frustrated, and maybe over-eager, would-be buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in March were up 10.2% from a year earlier, the largest annual gain since prices began to fall in 2006, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case Shiller national home-price index. Some of the largest gains were in markets that experienced the biggest declines during the foreclosure crisis—the very places that have attracted some of the most intense institutional interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This institutional buying activity has boosted the housing market and may be good (at least in the near term) for the overall economy. These buyers are typically purchasing foreclosed homes that require considerable renovation—creating jobs for local contractors and pumping up sales at home-improvement companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Partly because the housing market varies so widely by geography, Stefan Hilts, director at <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>, cautions against making a blanket statement about whether or not we're in the midst of another bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But price gains in certain markets, especially in some areas of California, are a potential cause for concern as some "fundamentals" aren't keeping pace with gains, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Still-high unemployment is our biggest concern," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plus, some institutional investors are already starting to sell their properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Institutional investors will eventually sell the homes they've purchased at bargain prices and rented out but they're unlikely to dump homes onto the market en masse, says Jed Kolko, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, a real-estate website. "They don't want to trigger a price drop either," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kolko adds that buyers in markets where inventory is very tight would be "thrilled" if investors decided to put some of their homes up for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though prices have risen sharply in the past year, they're still relatively low. Home prices are still down by 28% from their 2006 peak—about where they were in 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These low prices coupled with still-low mortgage rates makes buying more affordable today than it's likely to be six or 12 months from now, Mr. Kolko says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And with about 26% of all homeowners nationwide underwater in their mortgage and another 850,000 actively in the foreclosure process, according to RealtyTrac, there's plenty of shadow inventory to keep a lid on prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Do not rush into it and stretch yourself financially to buy based on an irrational fear that if you don't buy now you will miss out on the opportunity to buy ever," warns RealtyTrac vice president Daren Blomquist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He anticipates more homes becoming available as early as this fall in the form of shadow foreclosure inventory in some markets as well as in the form of nondistressed sellers who decide to list their properties because prices have risen enough for them to justify doing so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No matter what the market conditions, the purchase of a house needs to be viewed primarily as a home with any investment consideration being a "distant second," says Erik Davidson, deputy chief investment officer at Wells Fargo Private Bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Progress toward other financial goals—an emergency fund, retirement, college fund, etc—shouldn't be waylaid in the pursuit of the goal of owning a house," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's wise to have a down payment of 20%—to avoid paying for private mortgage insurance—and plan to live in the home for at least five years, says Stan Humphries, chief economist at Zillow, a real-estate listings company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time buyers should also explore how much it will really cost to own, says Edward Kohlhepp Jr., a financial planner in Doylestown, Pa.: "They often forget about the costs of things like insurance, maintenance and renovations."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also advises people who know they're going to buy within a year to keep their down payment out of the stock market. "There's no place for risk with your home's down payment," he says.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anya Martin </div><div>773 words</div><div>7 June 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M5</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More real-estate investors are seeking solid returns. But they're not buying homes. They're buying mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the residential market bounces back, investors are showing renewed interest in buying mortgage-backed securities -- loans that the lenders have bundled and sold as consolidated debt. Since selling off jumbo mortgages lessens lenders' risk, more banks, credit unions and other financial institutions are offering jumbos. And more competition could mean better terms for consumers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first quarter of 2013, $4 billion worth of jumbo loans were sold by lenders, more than the $3.5 billion total of securitized jumbos in all of 2012, according to Guy Cecala, publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance. If the pace holds through 2013, the volume of securitized loans could reach $16 billion, Mr. Cecala said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, while a 400% annual increase is significant, $16 billion still represents just 7% of the $220 billion volume projected for jumbo loans in 2013, he added. Lenders issued $203 billion in jumbo loans in 2012, and securitized loans accounted for less than 2% of that total.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The vast majority of jumbo loans aren't securitized still, and the [secondary] market has a long way to go to be any reflection of what it used to be before the housing crash," Mr. Cecala said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before 2008, as many as two-thirds to three-fourths of all jumbo residential mortgages were securitized, he said. Then the mortgage meltdown occurred, and investors shunned jumbo securitized mortgages in favor of investments containing pools of government-backed mortgages by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> or <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, which only guarantee loan amounts up to $417,000 in most of the U.S. and $625,500 in pricey metro areas, such as New York and San Francisco. That dearth of the "secondary market" meant lenders had to hold any jumbo mortgages, which are above those dollar limits, on their books.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Redwood Trust Inc</span>. was the first player to re-enter the jumbo secondary market in 2010, and the real-estate investment trust (REIT) has announced plans to securitize $7 billion in jumbo loans in 2013, three times more than its $2 billion volume in 2012. Its success has triggered more investors, including <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>, Shellpoint Partners, JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co., <span class="companylink">Two Harbors Investment Corp</span>, and <span class="companylink">PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The secondary market's rebirth has allowed <span class="companylink">EverBank Financial Corp</span>. to offer 30-year, fixed-rate jumbo mortgages, said Tom Wind, executive vice president of residential and commercial lending for the Jacksonville, Fla.-based bank. Interest rates for a 30-year, fixed-rate jumbo mortgage were 4.20% on May 31, just 0.13 basis points more than the 4.07% rate for a conforming mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EverBank sold its first pool of securitized prime jumbo loans on the secondary market in April, netting $307.4 million, according to a Securities Exchange Commission filing. The lender anticipates bundling and selling more jumbos this year, Mr. Wind said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ability to sell loans has allowed San Francisco-based RPM Mortgage to expand its jumbo originations by 233% from 2011 to 2012, said Julian Hebron, vice president of the San Francisco-based boutique lender. RPM is now the second-highest volume lender to home buyers in the nine-county Bay Area, where jumbos now account for 48.1% of all purchase lending, according to DataQuick. RPM's year-to-date 2013 jumbo production already has exceeded its 2012 total, Mr. Hebron said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other issues to consider:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Credit qualifications remain tight. Investors look to buy securitized loans from lenders with tight qualification standards for borrowers, so solid credit scores, high down payments and excellent loan-to-income ratios are still important, Mr. Wind said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Customer service. When lenders securitize loans, they sometimes retain servicing, and sometimes the purchaser takes it on. Currently, RPM retains servicing on 40% of its jumbo loans, but Mr. Hebron said he hopes the expanded secondary market will allow the firm to increase that number to 80%. "We want to remain the point of contact for our customer," he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- New rules coming. New Consumer Financial Protection Bureau regulations take effect in early 2014 that may require lenders and/or securitizers to hold 5% of the amount of securitized loans that aren't qualified mortgages. Some loan types, such as interest-only loans, may be more difficult for borrowers to find, since securitizers will be less likely to want to buy them from lenders due to the 5% rule, said Keith Gumbinger, vice president at HSH.com, a mortgage-information website.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Zusha Elinson   </div><div>1060 words</div><div>6 June 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A13B</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City supervisors are planning in the coming months to take up legislation aimed in part at cleaning up San Francisco's Department of Building Inspection, which has been the target of multiple corruption probes over the years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Francisco Supervisor David Chiu and city attorney Dennis Herrera have proposed a package of new ethics rules intended to increase transparency at the building department and other parts of the city bureaucracy. The regulations would require all permit expediters -- people in the private sector who are paid by developers and others to help speed building permits through the city's Byzantine approval process -- to file regular reports disclosing their clients and any contact they have with city employees or officials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With the [Department of Building Inspection] and other departments that churn through thousands of permits, the public deserves to know who's influencing these decisions," says Mr. Chiu, the board president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move comes as the city is experiencing a construction boom, with cranes dotting San Francisco's skyline and apartment buildings rising from the street. The metropolitan area covering San Francisco, Oakland and Fremont saw an estimated $407.5 million of new residential construction in the first quarter, up 17% from the previous year, according to McGraw Hill Construction, a real-estate research division of the financial and publishing company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also comes after years of troubles at the building department, which approves permits for remodels, additions and new construction, and is responsible for ensuring that buildings are up to code and safe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building-department officials and expediters have been charged, and some convicted, with a variety of crimes in the past 15 years. Among the latest to face charges is 59-year-old Jimmy Jen, a former building-department plan checker turned permit expediter who is headed to trial in San Francisco Superior Court. He is charged with 232 felony counts for allegedly faking documents involving construction projects on approximately 85 properties around the city for nearly two decades beginning in 1990, according to court documents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jen, who has pleaded not guilty to the charges, is in custody and couldn't be reached for comment. His attorney didn't return repeated calls seeking comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reports from civil grand juries in San Francisco -- which serve a watchdog role and don't have the power to indict -- have blasted the department over the years, leveling accusations that certain expediters and builders have received preferential treatment from building-department officials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What we hear often is that there are hundreds of permits that are sitting on city staffers' desks and the vast majority collect dust for many months except those permits that have an expediter that has a relationship with an employee that can have it pulled to the top of the list," Mr. Chiu says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William Strawn, a spokesman for the building department, says that everyone is treated equally. He adds, "I am for as much transparency as the system will permit."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some permit expediters say the proposed regulations are burdensome and unnecessary. "You're going to create stacks of paperwork that nobody can understand," says Henry Karnilowicz, a permit expediter who runs Occidental Express, an expediting firm in the South of Market area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Karnilowicz says the expediter plays an important role in helping people navigate the maze of city approvals. Recently, for example, he says it took nearly a year for him to help a client get approvals to convert a storage room to a studio apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People think you get stuff done because you know folks," he says. "It's sort of true, but it's not knowing folks -- it's knowing how to treat them."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Karnilowicz says all expediters are being unfairly painted with the same broad brush. He and some city officials say they believe the legislation is aimed in large part at politically connected expediters such as Walter Wong. Mr. Wong's company, according to campaign filings, paid the salaries of field workers for the "Run, Ed, Run" campaign that propelled Mayor Ed Lee into office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wong is a "pretty heavy hitter who can pull together funds for politicians," Mr. Karnilowicz says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wong didn't return calls seeking comment. Christine Falvey, a spokeswoman for Mr. Lee, says the mayor is "always willing to look at legislation that strengthens transparency," but didn't respond to questions about Mr. Wong. Mr. Chiu said the legislation isn't targeted at anyone in particular.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Warren Mar, a member of the Building Inspection Committee -- a panel of private citizens appointed by the mayor and the Board of Supervisors to oversee the building department -- says he favors more "sunshine" and adds the permit process should be simplified so that there is no need for expediters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A competent architect should be able to navigate that process, and I believe the same is true for an engineer," Mr. Mar says. "There shouldn't be a need for a person to be lobbying like this."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lou Vasquez, principal of San Francisco developer <span class="companylink">Build Inc</span>., says expediters are indispensable for builders. "The whole system is so opaque and so dysfunctional and so bureaucratic," he says. "Without expediters the whole system would collapse."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, new problems for the department surfaced in March when Jaime Valle, a plan checker, resigned after he was investigated by the city over questions about whether he was doing work he didn't have permission to do and whether there was a conflict of interest with his own job, says Mr. Strawn, the spokesman. Mr. Strawn declined to elaborate because he says it was a personnel matter. Mr. Valle hasn't been accused of any wrongdoing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People familiar with the matter say Mr. Valle was allegedly moonlighting as an expediter for private clients while at the same time working behind the counter in the building department. Mr. Valle declined several requests for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Strawn says the building department has "a zero-tolerance policy for any employee who violates conflict of interest, legal and ethical requirements."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mar says the situation with Mr. Valle is a cautionary tale. "If the expediters can pull a permit and get it faster, then you end up with city employees doing it too."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OTTAWA—Canadian monthly building permits increased unexpectedly in April to post the largest gain in six months as planned construction of multi-family homes such as condominiums rose at the fastest pace since March 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It marks only the third increase in plans to build multi-family residences since last July when the government tightened mortgage insurance rules for the fourth time since 2008 to rein in household debt and cool the housing sector</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The value of building permits issued by Canadian municipalities rose 10.5% in April, the fourth consecutive gain, to 6.96 billion Canadian dollars ($6.73 billion), Statistics Canada said Wednesday. Plans to build multi-family residences, including condominiums, apartments, and town houses, soared 51.9%, led by gains in Ontario, British Columbia and Quebec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consensus call was for a 3% decline in overall permits, according to a report from <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Canada</span>. The prior month's increase, originally estimated at 8.6%, was revised down to 6.0%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a year-over-year basis, building permits in April rebounded to 5.4% after declining 8.9% in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data, which provide an early indication of building activity, is based on a survey of 2,400 municipalities representing 95% of the country's population.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Ted Mann </div><div>923 words</div><div>5 June 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A15</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Metropolitan Transportation Authority plans to close a key subway tunnel linking Brooklyn and Manhattan for at least a year, bowing to the need for a prolonged outage to repair lingering damage from superstorm Sandy, an MTA official said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The closure of the Montague tube, which carries the R train beneath the mouth of the East River, is a blow to tens of thousands of daily riders who commute on the R from southern Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Work on the Montague tube will likely begin in August, and is expected to last 12 to 14 months, the official said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is the biggest post-Sandy setback for the MTA, which has drawn high marks for the speed with which subway service was restored after the Oct. 29 storm. It may not be the last.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The authority also considered closing the Greenpoint tube on the G train all summer for repair work. Instead, the tunnel will be closed for 12 weekends this year. Service will be replaced with a shuttle bus between Brooklyn and Queens. The Greenpoint tube will likely be closed during the summer of 2014 for additional repairs, the official said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While no similar outages are planned as yet for the MTA's other under-river tunnels, the closure of the Montague tube underscores how hard it will be to complete some critical storm repairs while continuing to run a 24-hour subway system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Pretty much anything down there that's made of metal is rusting," the official said. "And sooner or later, it has to come out."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the MTA was able to pump out subway tunnels and restart service on the trains after the storm, a threat to the system remained: the lingering corrosion from brackish floodwaters. The salt from storm surges heavily damaged sensitive electronic components in the tunnels, and continues to eat away at wires, cables and motors, causing failures that have snarled commutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're all starting to fail," Wynton Habersham, the MTA's chief electrical officer, said this spring before the decision to shut down Montague was made.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MTA work crews have spent months trying to fix problems in the Montague tube, which was among the most heavily damaged by flooding and the final under-river tunnel to be restored to working order, in December. Signal failures have been a chronic problem in the tunnel since the storm, leading to delayed trains and sometimes requiring rerouting R trains over the Manhattan Bridge to cross the river.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The official said MTA leaders determined earlier this spring that they couldn't complete the necessary work using the normal mix of overnight and off-hour shifts. Instead, the full tunnel will be shut down this summer so the damaged components -- from lighting to the signals that enable trains to safely move through the system -- can be replaced. The cost will be at least $100 million, according to legal notices prepared for the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The repairs are vast. Contractors will rip out and replace ducts, wiring, lights, thousands of feet of cable and rails. The work also will include replacement of three submersible pumps and two substations that help send power to the tunnel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the MTA's greatest strengths for riders -- it runs 24 hours a day -- is a glaring disadvantage for the workers who keep the system running. That slows the pace of maintenance work even in the best of times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The difficulty of working in the active train tunnel was clear in early March. One night, a Wall Street Journal reporter accompanied a work crew to a trouble spot in the Montague tube deep beneath the East River.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem this time: a nearly 700-pound steel box called an impedance bond, which ensures that the signals in the tunnel get the proper electrical current. A crew had already fixed it once after Sandy, but now was returning to replace it entirely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The leader of the 10-man crew, a veteran supervisor named Angel Perez, said the problems with the bond were a classic example of what MTA calls "latent failures" of its equipment since the storm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Sometimes, especially with this, we think we fixed it," Mr. Perez said. "Then at rush hour it starts failing again."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crew struggled all night to lift the new impedance bond into place. They used the simplest of tactics -- grunting effort, a long wooden pole and a heavy rope knotted around the steel case -- as they worked to lift the box onto the corroded steel braces that would hold it between the rails. But they had to keep stopping every few minutes to make way for passing trains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As train traffic began to pick up with the morning rush approaching, Mr. Perez's crew was still working, the device not yet secured in place. A radio squawked around 5 a.m. with a report from the tower: A train operator had spotted what he thought was a safety lantern mistakenly left in the Brooklyn mouth of the tunnel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Control, we're still working in the tube," Mr. Perez called into a radio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Still working?!" the tower called back. "Aw, you can't be doing that. Give us a call."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less than an hour later, the crew was clearing up its tools for good, the bond in place but not yet functioning. Within days, the signals in the tunnel were failing again.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trulia Inc. shares climbed 74% from the company's initial pricing of $17 in September to the close of trading on Tuesday. A Property Report article on Wednesday about real-estate broker commissions incorrectly said the shares rose 58%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential real-estate brokers and agents -- among the hardest hit during the housing bust -- are seeing their compensation rise at the fastest pace in nearly a decade as home sales and prices pick up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar value of commissions received by real-estate agents per transaction jumped 2.7% in April from the prior month, as measured by changes in the producer-price index. That is the largest monthly gain in eight years and the third-largest monthly gain in the 17 years that the PPI has tracked real-estate commissions. Year over year, commissions per transaction were up 9.1% in April, the largest annual gain since August 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Realtors' fortunes improving, investors have bid up the stock prices of real-estate-services companies. Shares of <span class="companylink">Realogy Holdings Corp</span>., the nation's largest real-estate brokerage firm that includes Coldwell Banker, Century 21 and Corcoran, have climbed 79% from their initial pricing at the company's IPO in October. On Tuesday, shares closed at $48.46, down 3.5% from Monday's close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While commission rates for <span class="companylink">Realogy</span>'s brokers have held steady at around 5% per transaction, the average sale price of homes handled by brokerages franchised by <span class="companylink">Realogy</span> jumped 7.7% between 2011 and 2012. Over the same period, <span class="companylink">Realogy</span>'s annual revenue increased 14%, to $4.7 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As commissions and volume goes up, there's going to be a decent-sized improvement in their earnings," says Evan Mann, a debt analyst with Gimme Credit who covers <span class="companylink">Realogy</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two other real-estate-services companies that debuted on public markets in the past two years, <span class="companylink">Trulia Inc</span>. and real-estate-information company <span class="companylink">Zillow Inc</span>., also are beginning to ride the wave of rising prices. Shares of <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, which earns income from online ads on its website and from fees paid by Realtors to market homes, have climbed 58% from its initial pricing of $17 in September. Zillow's stock, which has been on a tear over the past eight months, ended at $52 on Tuesday, up 122% from a 12-month low of $23 in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sharply rising home prices, as well as a short supply of available homes for the expanding ranks of buyers in the market, have made sellers more willing to pay full commissions to Realtors. "We're seeing a lot more 3% commissions," instead of the 2.5% commissions typically paid to sellers' agents for handling one side of distressed housing transactions, says Kenny Klaus, an agent in Mesa, Ariz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent weeks, <span class="companylink">Maracay Homes</span>, a builder with projects in the Phoenix area, circulated a flier to agents, including Mr. Klaus, offering them a 5% co-brokerage commission for selling certain homes in a Maracay community, then offering to increase the commission to as much a 7.5% for brokers who sell five Maracay homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realtors are benefiting from the housing rebound in other ways. Many owned rental homes or were flippers, building or buying homes, fixing them and reselling at a profit. When the downturn hit, many couldn't sell homes and lost their investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Atwood, a seller's agent in Baltimore, borrowed $740,000 in 2007 to build a row house with an elevator, custom concrete countertops and a 40-foot-long roof deck in a trendy waterfront neighborhood in the city. He expected to live in the home for a few years, then flip it for over $900,000. But when the market collapsed, Mr. Atwood couldn't afford his loan payments and handed the house over to his lender in March 2012. The property recently sold to another buyer for $465,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We made all the classic mistakes people make when they drank the Kool-Aid as the market was going up," says Mr. Atwood, who now lives in a rental property in Miller Island, about 10 miles from Baltimore. "We're renting for two years and trying to get back on our feet."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others, like Chris Hart, lost their brokerages. At the height of the housing boom in 2006, he starting selling off his personal portfolio of real estate -- eight houses, town homes and condos and a few pieces of land around Myrtle Beach, S.C. and Fayetteville, N.C. He plowed the profits into his new business, a small real-estate brokerage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But business dried during the downturn and Mr. Hart closed his brokerage and filed for bankruptcy protection in 2012. "I was playing the Monopoly game where you purchase a couple of single-family homes and condos, and you cash in and trade up," says Mr. Hart, who in January moved north to start fresh, working as a Realtor for <span class="companylink">Keller Williams Realty</span> in Framingham, Mass. "It left me in a position where I was back at square one to start my portfolio up again."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Corrie Driebusch   </div><div>655 words</div><div>4 June 2013</div><div>15:39</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK—The Fidelity Select Construction and Housing Portfolio fund (FSHOX) is betting on the rising cost of U.S. homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first quarter, the national median closing price for existing single-family homes jumped 11% from the prior year, the biggest year-over-year gain since the end of 2005, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. And building permits for single-family homes rose in April to their highest level since May 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the housing recovery chugs along, the fund, which has nearly $800 million in assets under management, similarly has had a standout year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past 12 months ending May 31, the fund has returned about 45%, according to Morningstar. Year-to-date it is up 16%, in line with its benchmark, the customized MSCI IMI Construction &amp; Housing 25-50 index. The benchmark is up 15.5% year to date and in the past 12 months has returned nearly 43%, according to Fidelity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strong returns are a result of the fund management's conviction in the single-family housing recovery, which it aims to take advantage of by investing in not only materials companies and home builders, but also makers of appliances and home-improvement behemoths.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the housing recovery in the U.S. has progressed, the fund's investments have, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the early phases of the recovery, the fund, which invests in roughly 35 to 55 companies, sought positions in single-family homebuilders, such as <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>. (LEN) and <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers Inc</span>. (TOL).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In the early phases of recovery, that's the way to play it," says Holger Boerner, the fund's manager. The next phase of recovery could come in the form of the materials going into the home--from cabinetry to furnishings, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To reflect this, the fund's top positions shifted to home-improvement chains, such as <span class="companylink">Home Depot Inc</span>. (HD) and <span class="companylink">Lowe's Cos</span>. (LOW), both of which the fund has investments in. Mr. Boerner calls these positions "derivative plays" on the housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These types of companies tend to do well in this stage of the recovery not just because people are moving into and furnishing their new homes, but also because long-term home owners are becoming more interested in sprucing up their houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A home for a lot of individuals is the biggest single investment that will be made in somebody's life," says Mr. Boerner. "As long as home prices are going up people feel better about the worth of their own investment, and that makes people feel better about spending."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And even as demand for home purchases has increased, pushing up home prices, Mr. Boerner said he also sees a tailwind to the sector in the form of more household formations, driven by stronger consumer sentiment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is a fund that's going to do very well when housing is recovering, which is what we've seen in 2012 and 2013," says Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual-fund research at S&amp;P Capital IQ. Still, while he notes the fund does have diversification in that its not solely invested in home builders, it is still very industry specific.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This could make sense for someone as part of their portfolio but not as a main part of their portfolio because it's not diversified enough," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Concerning to many housing-recovery bulls is the threat of rising mortgage rates. Mr. Boerner, however, takes a silver-lings view.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small interest-rate increases may be potentially beneficial for the housing market: Some people who have saved up a downpayment over the past several years have been twiddling their thumbs, waiting to get an even better deal on a mortgage, Mr. Boerner says. A slight uptick in mortgage rates may instill some panic in these people and finally get them off the fence.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Ben Casselman and Neil Shah </div><div>712 words</div><div>4 June 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. factories in May posted their worst month since the end of the recession, as weakness overseas overwhelmed a still-shaky recovery at home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management on Monday said manufacturing activity shrank in May for the first time since November. The institute's index, in which any reading below 50 indicates contraction, fell to 49 from 50.7 in April. The reading, based on a survey of corporate purchasing managers, is the lowest since June 2009, the final month of the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a fragile recovery," said Alexander Cutler, chairman and chief executive of industrial conglomerate <span class="companylink">Eaton Corp</span>. "This has been very much the environment we've been talking about for the past several years."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cutler said the global slowdown has left Eaton, which has manufacturing facilities in 42 countries and makes everything from industrial hoses to airplane parts, with less of a cushion to offset the shaky U.S. economy. And while the rebound in the housing market has helped boost consumers' confidence, he said many of Eaton's industrial customers remain reluctant to invest in major long-term projects, in part because of continuing uncertainty about economic policy in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM report showed weakness across the board, with current production declining, employment remaining stagnant, and new orders falling -- an especially worrisome sign because it provides little hope for improvement in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, Monday's data is just the latest in a series of signs that the manufacturing sector -- a key driver of growth early in the recovery -- is losing steam. The Federal Reserve last month said that factory output fell in April for the second month in a row and that hiring in the sector has slowed sharply to start the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not a glitch," John Silvia, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>, said of Monday's report. "It suggests that there is a more fundamental slowdown in the U.S. economy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Silvia cautioned that recent improvements in consumer spending and the housing market are helping to offset weakness in manufacturing, which after decades of decline is now a relatively small piece of the broader U.S. economy. Mr. Silvia, like most economists, sees little risk of the U.S. falling back into recession, although he estimates growth has slowed to 1.2% in the second quarter, from an already tepid 2.4% rate in the first three months of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowdown in the U.S. reflects in part the even greater troubles in overseas economies, as separate data released Monday made clear. The manufacturing sector in the 17-member euro zone shrank for the 22nd consecutive month in May, according to data provider Markit Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Key Asian economies such as Taiwan and Vietnam also saw their manufacturing sectors fall into contraction, according to Markit. Even China saw its once-booming industrial economy decline, Markit said, although the Chinese government's official manufacturing index showed a slight expansion in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowdown overseas is taking a toll on companies at home. U.S. exports in March fell to their lowest level since November. That's a reversal from earlier in the recovery, when strong growth in foreign sales helped offset weak demand at home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, as U.S. manufacturers count on domestic sales to carry them through, there is some cause for optimism. Stocks have been on a record run. The housing market is at last showing signs of a sustained rebound. And consumers have proven more resilient in the face of higher taxes than many economists expected. Overall, the U.S. economy grew at a 2.4% annual rate in the first three months of the year, hardly breakout growth but far better than Europe's grinding recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">May's manufacturing contraction puts even greater focus on the government's employment report, scheduled to be released Friday. Economists currently estimate the U.S. added 169,000 jobs in May, slightly better than April's performance. Mr. Cutler of Eaton said his company is hiring only slowly, focusing on getting more production out of its existing employees rather than adding workers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- To get a sense of how America will pack more people into its cities, head north to an alley that runs behind Petersham Avenue here. That's where Ajay Kumar built a $300,000, Moroccan-themed cottage that sits in his backyard and will soon be occupied by his parents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kumar's "laneway house" is part of a broader plan that encourages Vancouver homeowners to add rental units in their basements, attics and backyards. The hope is to reduce sky-high housing costs and increase population density throughout the city -- including the single-family-home neighborhoods like Mr. Kumar's that surround the city's towering downtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cities across the U.S. and Canada are liberalizing their zoning codes to allow multiple dwellings on a single lot. Planners like these "accessory units" because they steer growth to developed land and infrastructure, reducing the cost of city services. Such housing can allow seniors to live near their children. And the dwellings are smaller and cheaper -- helping cities create more affordable housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few cities have gone as far as Vancouver, which has seen real-estate prices soar after an influx of domestic and foreign buyers. In many U.S. cities, citizens might not tolerate changing the rules to boost population density. But other places, including those with high real-estate prices and housing shortages, are encouraging accessory units despite resistance from some residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These units are one front in a giant war for how our cities are going to grow," says Alan Durning, executive director of the Sightline Institute, a Seattle think tank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late last year Salt Lake City passed an ordinance to allow accessory units within a half mile of the city's two dozen light-rail stations. Washington, D.C.'s planning department is recommending giving owners that already have an accessory structure in place the right to rent them out without seeking zoning approval, as they must now. Seattle has allowed backyard cottages since 2009, and homeowners have applied to build 168 of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several Silicon Valley cities, looking to increase the stock of affordable housing, have used a combination of measures to encourage single family homeowners to build rental units. Those include reducing permit fees, increasing the allowed square footage and getting rid of administrative steps such as the public hearing process. Hillsborough has permitted 117 accessory units since 2003, while Los Altos Hills has permitted 68.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Businesses are entering the market. Advantis Credit Union in Portland, Ore., late last year started marketing mortgages that allow homeowners to build accessory units. Home builders such as <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>. have started marketing "multigenerational" homes that have separate quarters for a family member. In Berkeley, Calif., a company called New Avenue was founded to help people design, finance and build accessory units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, an idea that seems desirable to urban planners and builders enrages many homeowners who see new dwellings popping up in their neighborhoods. After the college town of Missoula, Mont., voted in May to allow accessory units in single-family home neighborhoods, Myra Shults, 71 years old, was concerned it would lead to scant parking and noisier streets, reducing her home's value in the process. "I just think the whole character of the neighborhood will change," says Ms. Shults, a retired lawyer. She says she moved to her neighborhood to live among other single-family homeowners "and now that's going away."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. cities used to be more compact. But by the 1920s, Americans were fleeing urban neighborhoods for leafy suburbs -- a movement that accelerated after World War II as the country built more freeways and pulled up urban streetcar lines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family neighborhoods have become less dense over the years -- a function of an aging population and falling household sizes, says Robert Bruegmann, a professor emeritus of architecture and urban planning at the University of Illinois at Chicago. As children leave for college and jobs, many seniors find themselves in homes too big for their needs. The generation behind them, meantime, continues to have fewer children -- reducing its need for space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cities have seen a small revival recently. From July 2011 to July 2012, 24 of the nation's 51 metropolitan areas with more than one million residents saw their cities grow faster than their suburbs. That was true of just eight metro areas from 2000 to 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a temperate climate and links to growing economies in Asia, Vancouver has all the affordability and space problems that most U.S. cities have and then some. Its real-estate prices have become unhinged from its local economy. A typical home in the city cost 721,500 Canadian dollars in March, or about US$696,000, up 25% from March 2007, according to an index compiled by the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver. U.S. prices fell around 26% over the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Vancouver prices have eased over the past year, they remain well out of reach for many residents. The city's median income was about C$47,000 in 2006, the latest data available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices have been affected by an inflow of investors and speculators -- many from Asia -- buying homes and condominiums. A recent study by Bing Thom Architects found that roughly half of Vancouver's downtown condominiums aren't occupied by the owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the past two decades, Vancouver's main approach to add housing has been to go up, constructing scores of downtown condo towers. Recently the city has started rezoning arterial streets to allow more compact row houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city took a step toward increasing density in single-family neighborhoods in the 1980s, when it first allowed basement suites. Since 2009, it has reduced the amount of time it takes to get a permit for basement apartments and permitted laneway homes like Mr. Kumar's throughout the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some 500 laneway homes have been built. In addition, about a third of the city's new single-family homes now are built with a rental suite in the home, up from 5% in 2000. With basement suites and laneway homes, "on paper, they have effectively tripled the density of a single-family home," says Andy Yan, a planner at Bing Thom Architects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The growth of laneway housing has created a cottage industry, literally, of manufacturers like Jake Fry of Smallworks. To keep costs down, he designs his homes from one of 14 models that buyers can customize. He has the frames built an hour-and-a-half outside of town in a truss and wall panel factory. This allows him to put the home up in a week; it takes another two months to finish the interiors and landscaping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fry also has developed tricks for squeezing his homes under the city's 750-square-foot limit for laneway homes, such as installing skinny appliances and building bookshelf walls. The entrance to closets are just under five feet high. At that height, their innards don't count against the city's square-footage limit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You have to treat the house like a sailboat," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fry's clients include Tania Clarke, a 31-year-old who grew up in Vancouver but can't afford a home in the city. So Ms. Clarke's parents took out a mortgage on their house; she and her husband used the proceeds to build a two-story, $300,000 cottage. It sits about 20 feet from Ms. Clarke's childhood bedroom, in what was once her mother's garden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"How often do you get to design your own house?" says Ms. Clarke, who works at a local botanical garden and supplements her income by selling clothing that she sews in a home office that converts to a garage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Clarke's house is a temple of efficient living, with touches such as a squat coffee table whose folding legs transform it into a dinner table. Living close requires compromise. Ms. Clarke sometimes has to sleep with ear plugs on nights when her husband continues playing videogames after she has gone to bed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple usually keeps the blinds in their living room shut. They say they are tired of pedestrians looking in at them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Clarke's neighbor, Amber Paul, doesn't mind the new unit. While the home casts a shadow on her backyard, she says it adds some life to an alleyway that is full of trash cans and electric poles. "It's a more friendly face on the lane than a double-car garage," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Paul is familiar with Ms. Clarke's situation: She lives in her parents' home with her husband and two daughters. Her parents stay in a suite below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A dozen blocks away, Ronald Hatch also lives next to a laneway home, and he hates it. Mr. Hatch, 73, a retired literature professor, says the two-story home shades his backyard, reducing his raspberry crop. With a window peering down on them, he and his wife feel like they are being watched when they sit at a round table in the yard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You're having your lunch on a sunny day and the first thing you see is a laneway house staring at you," says Mr. Hatch, who has tried to block out the view by adding three feet of latticework atop his fence.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government spending on construction is tumbling. Public construction spending dropped 1.2% in April to its lowest level since 2006, extending a 5.7% drop since October. The $85 billion in across-the-board federal spending cuts known as the sequester are taking a toll on building at a time when many local governments are still struggling with tight budgets and a tepid economy.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Landlords are coming together to pay annual dues for upkeep and improvements to a new city-owned park being developed on Manhattan's far West Side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there's one notable exception: the developer of the 26-acre Hudson Yards project at the southern edge of the planned park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Executives at Related Cos. -- which is planning to develop office buildings, stores and apartment buildings on its huge site -- have told people working on the park that they don't feel Related should have to contribute to its upkeep. The executives have pointed out that Related is already on the hook for funding the maintenance and operations of more than 12 acres of open space planned on its site given a prior agreement with the city. Company executives see another fee for maintenance in the area as a form of double taxation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other landlords in the area don't agree. "They should be paying the same thing as everybody else does," says Oskar Brecher, director of development for Moinian Group, which owns a site in the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new park, planned to run from West 33rd to West 36th streets for its first phase, is expected to open in 2014. While the city paid for construction, it never made a commitment to pay for much of its upkeep, leaving open the question of how it would be funded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, neighborhood property owners and community leaders are working on creating a so-called "business improvement district" that would require owners of commercial and some residential buildings to pay annual fees for park maintenance and other services for the area. Fees would range from $1 for owners of residential condos would exceed $10,000 for some owners of larger, newer buildings before more developments are finished and share the burden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question is what should be the boundaries of the district? Its plan calls for it to cover a large swath of the West Side, stretching from West 30th Street to West 42nd Street, and from Ninth Avenue to the east side of 11th Avenue. Landlords would pay based on a formula that takes into account the square footage, assessed value and type of property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that proposed area would include the eastern half of Related's 26-acre development. Related feels the boundaries of the BID should be redrawn to exclude it, as the company sees its project as benefiting less than the buildings that border the park. "We are supportive of the creation of a BID to provide enhanced services to the new neighborhood and maintain the new Hudson Park and Boulevard, funded by the properties that border it and will primarily benefit," a spokeswoman for Related said in a written statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Related also owns another West Side property near the new park and within the boundaries of the BID that it believes would be fair. Related is willing to make contributions to the BID for those properties but not for those in Hudson Yards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other landlords in the area argue that tenants in Hudson Yards are sure to use the new park to the north as well as the open space in Related's project. "When a person walks up to one open space, they're not going to see artificial boundaries," says Joe Restuccia, the executive director of Clinton Housing Development Company, a nonprofit housing developer in the area who is on the BID steering committee. "The whole thing is one whole -- it's meant to be seamless and Related should be part of it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barbara Cohen, the consultant for the BID, says the planning committee -- of which Related is a member -- is negotiating with Related on a special formula that would charge them a lesser rate and allow them to start paying later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We see it as a separate category, having a lot of relief compared to other properties. It results in a fair and reasonable contribution," Ms. Cohen says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the formula is already designed to accommodate properties differently, she says this doesn't amount to special treatment. "The truth of the matter is whether it was Related or ABC corporation that held that site, it's not about the owner. It's about the site's uniqueness," Ms. Cohen says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On its website for its rail yards development, Related touts the "broad tree-lined parks and open space" planned for the new park in a list of public investments in the area that the website calls "especially beneficial for Hudson Yards."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other properties will clearly see a big benefit from being even closer to the new park than the Related site. For example, Moinian Group's site sits directly on the new park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As opposed to having a roadway, our building is directly on the park. The east side retail opens up directly onto the park," Mr. Brecher says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, Mr. Brecher says his position is that Related should contribute on the same basis as other landlords. He points out that the deal Related got when it was named developer of Hudson Yards includes "both ups and downs," and the company's contention that its site should be viewed differently than other landlords isn't an argument that "holds water."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar is up 6.4% this year, according to The Wall Street Journal Dollar Index, and that is being largely attributed to a rebounding housing market and other signals of recovery in the U.S. economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So is it time to congratulate Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke? Not so fast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea that aggressive monetary stimulus by the Federal Reserve has finally built the foundations of a healthier U.S. economy might be an appealing notion. But a closer look at the impact of easy money on lending and economic growth suggests the economic payoff from four and half years of zero interest rates and close to $3 trillion in bond-buying is pretty slim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first round of "quantitative easing," or QEI as we've come to know it, certainly helped stabilize a dangerously unstable financial system in 2009. But the truth is that even that $1.75 trillion blast, as well as all that has come up since via QEII in 2010-2011 and the current, indefinitely timed QEIII program, has spurred relatively little credit growth in the wider economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two data points that demonstrate how ineffective it has been: loan-to-deposit ratios of the nation's largest banks stood at a meager 84% at the end of 2012, down from 101% in 2007; commercial banks' deposits at the Fed have grown from $1 trillion in March of 2009 to $2 trillion now. In other words, instead of lending out the cheap cash they've obtained from the Fed, banks continue to give it back to the central bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The banks' ongoing reluctance to lend inevitably stymies the Fed's efforts to stoke the economy. It's a big reason why people continue to worry that this year's first-quarter growth readout of 2.4% will inevitably give way to another disappointment in subsequent quarters, just as the economy has repeatedly done in the fits-and-starts recovery since 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another indicator of QE's limited impact is the so-called velocity of money. If quantitative easing were effective in restoring economic activity, more money would be changing hands, which would translate into a multiplier effect to fuel growth. But that's not happening. Setting aside a modest acceleration in velocity in the year that followed the end of the recession in mid-2009, this indicator has remained on a relentless downward track since the onset of the subprime mortgage crisis in early 2007. According to the <span class="companylink">St. Louis Fed</span>, the velocity of money, defined as the ratio of quarterly nominal GDP to the quarterly average of M2 money stock, is now at its lowest rate since the data series began in 1959.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QE itself is a factor in this, because it directly expands the monetary base, the denominator in the monetary velocity calculation. But that should be offset by a pickup in GDP--the numerator--which the stimulus is supposed to produce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this suggests the Fed has been effective in boosting prices in asset markets, where money tends to change hands less quickly, but not in boosting all-round economic activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What about the argument that the gains in one of those asset markets -- the housing market -- is now poised to give consumers the boost they need? Optimists will say the recent surge in housing prices will produce a "wealth effect" for average Americans in a way that the stock market's gains have not. In theory, it should induce them to spend more on other consumer goods. Fed's backers point to this rebound as proof that its efforts to drive down mortgage prices are working.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is the improvements in home prices aren't broad-based enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whereas a report Tuesday showed that the closely watched <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller report was up 10.9% year-on-year, its biggest gain since April 2009, a narrower index by <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span>, which includes homes backed by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> or <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> mortgages, showed a year-on-year gain of only 6.7% in the first quarter. The key point is that those federally backed mortgages cut out above $417,000, which means it excludes many higher priced homes. The conclusion: nationwide averages are skewed higher by top-end real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, even within the home loan agency mortgages bracket, there's an upward skew to the data. According to a census bureau report out last week, the share of homes priced under $200,000 fell from 43% to 32% from January 2011 to now, while homes between $200,000 and $400,000 raised their share from 44% to 50%. Meanwhile, anecdotal evidence suggests that home sales in expensive regions such as New York and Connecticut have been especially brusk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Windfall gains for rich people with New York condos or waterfront properties in Greenwich, Conn. won't do nearly as much for the broader economy as would a price recovery for suburban homes in, say, Phoenix or Indianapolis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until I see clearer evidence that the gains are being shared by everyone and that real economic activity is picking up, I'm going to stick with the conclusion that QE is simply fueling an asset bubble and nothing more.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-stager Douglas Pinter stepped out of a black SUV one recent morning, bound for the top floor of an apartment building on the north end of Central Park in Manhattan. But unlike the typical interior decorator with a fleet of moving vans, Mr. Pinter traveled light: He carried the living room in a portfolio bag slung over his shoulder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pinter's entire line of furniture is an illusion. The Noguchi-inspired coffee table, the contemporary white sofa, the posh art pedestal -- all are made of a lightweight material similar to that used to make milk cartons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I can bring a two-bedroom apartment up in four nylon bags," said Mr. Pinter, whose company, inFormed Space, creates origami-like polypropylene furniture that can be folded flat and then installed in a matter of hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the housing market continues to climb, so-called prop furniture is returning to form. What started as a byproduct of the early-2000s sales boom is making a comeback with new, stylish offerings of faux furnishings, including look-but-don't-sit sofas, cardboard bed frames and fake electronics. Some offer slick finishes while others come in a variety of homey slipcovers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment Mr. Pinter was staging -- a three-bedroom penthouse in a midrise condo -- fell into foreclosure in 2008. Now, one of the listing agents, Mark Reznik of <span class="companylink">A&amp;I Broadway Realty</span>, is preparing to put the fully renovated space on the market for about $2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon after arriving in the empty apartment, Mr. Pinter and his associate, Michael Smith, squatted down in a spare bedroom and began to bend, crease and clasp their white polymer panels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is a little like sausage being made," he said, joking that the process bears little resemblance to the finished product.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within three hours, the living and dining areas were staged with geometric sofas, faux art canvasses on the walls and a contemporary white resin sculpture provided by artist Dave Stevenson, which balances on a fake pedestal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The package costs about one-third the price of traditional staging, which could run several thousand dollars for a luxury apartment. Mr. Pinter charges $1,199 a month for a three-bedroom rental set and doesn't require a multimonth commitment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pinter launched inFormed Space earlier this year and has so far staged about seven listings. Of those listings, a $925,000 unit is in contract, and another sold for almost $1.3 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I see this as a phenomenon of a market that's waking up," said Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel Real Estate Appraisers &amp; Consultants. Mr. Miller said these kinds of novel approaches to real-estate marketing appear at the beginning of every new development boom cycle, as in the early 2000s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kevin Nielsen, a co-owner of <span class="companylink">NextStage</span> Furniture in Sioux Falls, S.D., has seen his business ebb and flow with the market. Founded in 2008, the company creates collapsible cardboard furniture with slipcovers for homes mostly in the $300,000 range. "When the market tanked, staging was hurt first," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the past year, he said, sales are picking up, Web traffic is rising and he is in the process of rolling out a new, more contemporary line of furnishings. He is distributing his collection to representatives in Southern California and Nova Scotia, Canada. A "starter kit," including a sofa, dining table and queen-size bed, costs about $600 before shipping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of the furniture is functional. But should someone mistakenly plop down on the corrugated bed frame, for example, they likely would be fine. "I've taken a nap on them before," Mr. Nielsen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The faux-electronics business also is enjoying a boost from the housing market's gains. Kenneth Guo, the owner of the Taiwan-based Real Electronic Props, said 2013 has gotten off to an auspicious start. Mr. Guo, who started in the plastic injection and molding business, switched to making replicas of flat-screen TVs in 2004, as the demand for such props started to pick up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fake TVs look identical to the real thing, but the electrical wiring is left out, allowing Mr. Guo to sell the devices at a low price to a mix of clients, although the majority are home designers. The popular 52-inch model retails for about $250. "We're trying for a 60-inch and 65-inch, because of a lot of inquiries," he said. The company ships internationally and maintains a Jamestown, N.C., warehouse that opened in 2010 for U.S. orders. In a good year, he said, he sells about 1,000 units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kelly Young, at Kelly Young Design Associates in Plantation, Fla., said her company expects to order more prop electronics from Mr. Guo to stage model homes as new-home construction picks up in the Fort Lauderdale area. Staging is a kind of fantasy, she said, and the goal should be to create experiences. "You want a home buyer to walk into the spaces and really feel like they could be sitting at [the] table," she said -- which is why they also buy fake videogame consoles (for the kids) and fake laptops and tablets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also a more practical reason to use the props: sticky-fingered visitors. Brokers say minor theft is an unavoidable part of open-house tours. "It doesn't matter what it is -- stuff walks," said Mary-Jo Swiatkowski, office manager at Kelly Young.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent morning, Gary Barnett walked through a black door and entered the dark Venetian-plastered foyer of an apartment in midtown Manhattan. A brass wire chandelier shaped like a branch hung overhead; a walnut console attached to the wall appeared to float nearby. Both were overshadowed by a large metal LED star, 5 feet by 5 feet, that hung next to the front door.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Is that the art installation?" asked Mr. Barnett, president of New York-based developer Extell Development. "Don't you think it's a little too sparkly?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no shortage of glittery things in the new model apartment of Extell's One57, one of the most ambitious -- and expensive -- new condominium buildings with a hotel in New York. Buyers include fashion executive Silas Chou, who is in contract for a unit on the 82nd floor for about $50 million, and a group of investors led by hedge-fund executive William Ackman who are in contract for a 13,554-square-foot penthouse for more than $90 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the building's upper floors readily show off their jaw-dropping views -- about 70% of One57's 92 units are already sold -- Extell is betting that its dramatically staged model on the 41st floor will help sell the building's lower levels. The company is spending more on this model than it normally would and decided to design the model earlier than usual in the process, while construction was still continuing. "Once people come in here, this line is going to sell quickly," Mr. Barnett said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Model homes -- units staged by developers and interior designers to give buyers an idea what the homes look like furnished -- have been around since the advent of the suburbs in the 1950s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, their potency as selling vehicles for luxury condominiums has grown as more buyers -- particularly those from overseas -- buy condos sight unseen, often committing millions of dollars while a building's construction is still under way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 515 East 72, a 326-unit building in Manhattan, three residences with the same floor plan as the model sold within two weeks after the model was unveiled in late April. Before the model's opening, only two units of that particular line had sold in the past year. In Miami, the 70-unit Bellini building, where prices range from $1 million to $4 million, sold six units in the same line a week after the model was introduced in late March. The model itself, a 2,608-square-foot apartment with glass floors also sold, for $1.65 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to developers and designers, the popularity of model units is driven in part by the surge of foreign buyers, who prefer their apartments finished and ready to move into. That has prompted developers to spend hefty sums on models that, in many cases, sell as-is. "The less [buyers] have to think about the choices they have, the more likely they are to buy," says Ziel Feldman, founder of HFZ Capital Group, which is redeveloping the Marquand, a 100-year-old, 14-story building on Manhattan's Upper East Side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bob Morris, a retired mutual-fund executive, so liked the model apartment at the <span class="companylink">Ritz-Carlton</span> Residences, Singer Island in Palm Beach that he made an offer on it shortly after touring the property. He ended up buying a different unit, a 3-bedroom, 3 1/2 bath condo for $1.57 million because it was on a higher floor. But he decided to hire the decorator who did the model to design his space, which, when completed later this month, will have an "urban beach" style, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Designers of model apartments typically stick to neutral hues because they want the space to speak for itself, says Lee Mindel, an architect whose firm Shelton, Mindel &amp; Associates is currently designing the model at the Marquand, where apartments start at $15 million. Many designers mix old and new furniture to appeal to buyers with a variety of tastes. Increasingly, some accessories are kept to a minimum (no trays of fake fruit angled on the bed), to allow potential buyers to imagine their own belongings in the space. "My number one rule is if you can't enhance the space, don't fill it," says Hadas Dembo, an interior designer in New York who is working on a model apartment at the Warren Lofts in TriBeCa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there's the model at One57. The space is brimming with textures (silk walls), sumptuous accessories (limited-edition bronze trinket boxes) and Hollywood glam touches. In the master bedroom, a leather-upholstered headboard serves as the backdrop to a bleached fox-fur bedspread and a circular crystal chandelier hangs overhead. The walls are covered in raw silk, which matches the cream curtains. A custom installation of more than three-dozen, bronze-colored porcelain flowers hangs on the wall over the bed, and a solid glass desk with a bronze stool covered in Mongolian fur sits by the windows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the living room, which has 58 feet of floor-to-ceiling windows facing Central Park, velvet couches are flanked by two abstract chairs -- one upholstered in nubby wool, the other a butterfly-shaped chair made out of wool and silk felt. Louis XVI dining chairs from the 18th century encircle a stone table with a recessed bowl in the middle where candles float. A modern chandelier overhead was made with real dandelion seeds individually affixed to LED lights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While much of the 3,228-square-foot, three-bedroom, 3 1/2-bath model sticks primarily to hues of black, cream and clear glass, the den/study has acid-green lacquered walls, a velvet dark lime-green upholstered couch with yellow and blue accent pillows, black-steel bookshelves and a diamond-patterned horsehair rug. The model's designer David Mann, of MR Architecture + Decor, says he made it the "standout room" to make it pop from the rest of the unit. According to Extell, the model has upgrades and furnishings that would retail for about $3 million; the unit's list price is $17.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To create One57's model, Extell's design team said they started by imagining who would live in the unit. The team envisioned an executive in fashion or business who has a grown child. With that in mind, Mr. Mann said he decided on a "fanciful, slightly over-the-top look" with texture playing a big role.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mann, who is known for his dramatic looks that tend toward contemporary and eclectic, said he doesn't think the fanciful design of One57's model represents a risk. He said that at the extremely exclusive end of the market, a model that was a bit over the top is necessary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Designing the model while the building was still under construction made the process much more difficult. Some art galleries, for example, wanted Extell to take out additional insurance because their pieces would be on a construction site. To overcome the issue, the design team borrowed a couple of pieces from Mr. Mann's own collection and found other galleries who were willing to work with them without needing additional insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest challenge for a model can be the budget. Luxury developers try to set aside sums that will give allow for a well-appointed home that reflects the building without breaking the bank. Mr. Feldman, the developer of the Marquand, estimates that most high-end models cost between $500,000 and $750,000. This is on par with what One57's model ended up costing for the furnishings alone, though much of the art at One57 was borrowed instead of purchased to bring down the cost, which initially started at $1 million, excluding artwork and labor fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Time constraints can also be a factor, with many furniture makers unable to turn around a custom piece in a matter of weeks. When in doubt, model-apartment designers build pieces themselves. Mr. Mann's firm designed multiple pieces in the One57 apartment. Mariette Himes Gomez, who designed the model at 515 East 72, wound up building a soffit for the kitchen and installing an island in the space to "not make the kitchen look like it was falling into the living room," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's usually some trial and error. In One57's den, it took five tries before the green lacquer was dark enough, and the first upholsterer working on a voluptuous chair in the living room quit because of the job's difficulty. When the outlets in the second bedroom were mounted too high, Mr. Mann used black and white tiles made by a friend to cover them up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the morning that Mr. Barnett came to see the model apartment, he sat down in one of the Louis XVI chairs. There was a small popping sound and later, a crack appeared in the back of the chair. Now a card placed on the dining table reads, "Please do not sit on chairs."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the foyer: The dark plastered walls are going to be covered up by leather graphite-colored panels to lighten the space and the LED star is going to be exchanged for a more subdued photograph of a tree.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar strengthened after reports pointed to a rebounding U.S. housing sector and buoyant consumer confidence, increasing the appeal of the U.S. currency among investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in March rose 10.9% from a year earlier, their biggest gains in seven years, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller index. Prices in all 20 cities in the index saw annual increases for the third month in a row, reinforcing expectations that the housing market has finally turned a corner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span>'s index of consumer confidence rose to its highest level since February 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors started betting on a stronger dollar this year as steady growth in the labor market and improvements in the housing sector underpinned the view that the U.S. economy is poised to pull ahead of other developed economies, which continue to suffer with little or no growth. Recent speculation about when the Federal Reserve will be able to pull back from its exceptionally easy monetary policy stance has given the dollar an added element of support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"One of the bright spots in the global economy will be the U.S. in the next few months, and that has allowed the dollar to make some decent gains," said Charles St-Arnaud, a currency strategist at Nomura Securities in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By late afternoon, the dollar was at ¥102.30 compared with ¥100.95 late Monday. The dollar traded at 0.9770 Swiss franc from 0.9631 franc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. currency also rallied strongly against most emerging-markets currencies, with the Mexican peso falling to its lowest level since early March, and the South African rand slumping to a four-year low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wall Street Journal Dollar Index, which tracks the U.S. dollar against a basket of currencies, was at 75.82, up 0.8% from late Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether the dollar will continue to rally likely depends on expectations for the future of the Fed's bond-buying program, which has kept long-term interest rates low and has tended to weigh on the value of the greenback. Fed officials, including Chairman Ben Bernanke, have started openly discussing when the central bank's $85 billion in monthly bond purchases should be tapered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Folks are going to be looking at the U.S. [economic] data to see where the Fed might be leaning next," said Brad Bechtel, managing director at Faros Trading in Stamford, Conn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond the U.S., a board member at the <span class="companylink">Bank of Japan</span> reaffirmed that the central bank's bold monetary stimulus is helping keep interest rates low. The yen, a popular safe haven, has tumbled in recent months in response to the BOJ's policy but strengthened in recent days amid increased volatility in Japan's stock market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro was at $1.2859 compared with $1.2931 late Monday. The common currency changed hands at ¥131.51 from ¥130.46. The U.K. pound was at $1.5042 from $1.5101.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> is trying to revive its flagship real-estate program after suffering huge losses during the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The investment firm's real-estate unit, <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley Real Estate Funds</span>, or Msref, is gearing up to raise a $1 billion to $3 billion global property fund, say people familiar with the discussions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fund executives have started talking to pension funds and other prospective investors and are hoping that <span class="companylink">China Investment Corp</span>., a giant government-run fund that securities filings show owns a 6.4% stake in <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>, will become an anchor investor, people said. Fund executives are emboldened by the recent success of some of investments from a fund that has been investing since the crash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> faces lingering animosity from many large investors that could make raising new money a challenge. The bank's largest real-estate fund, raised near the peak of the market around 2007, has reported losses of several billion dollars, according to pension-fund documents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">New York State Common Retirement Fund</span>, which has invested in numerous Msref funds, took the unusual step of canceling a $300 million commitment to one of those funds in 2010, after some of those investments soured, say people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $160 billion New York pension fund is still invested in several <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> funds but isn't ready to consider a new <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> one. "We would want to see its track record before making a new commitment," said Skip Miller, head of real estate for the pension fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Morgan Stanley spokesman declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>'s effort represents one of the first by a major Wall Street bank to challenge the private-equity giants that recently have dominated private fundraising in the real-estate world. Since the financial downturn, banks mostly have stayed on the sidelines, while firms such as <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span> and <span class="companylink">Starwood Capital Group</span> have raised new multibillion dollar funds to take advantage of improving property markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 1991, <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>'s real-estate unit has acquired more than $186 billion in property world-wide, resulting in large fees for the firm during good years. In 2007, <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> took in nearly $200 million in fees related to an $8.8 billion fund -- its largest -- raised that year, according to documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morgan Stanley Chief Executive James Gorman has made it clear he is wary about investing large amounts of the firm's money in real-estate funds and similar risky businesses. But he has said the firm still considers such funds as a "core" business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you have good performance, you attract funds," Mr. Gorman said during a 2010 analyst call.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investment banks piled into real estate following the recession of the early 1990s and reaped huge profits over the years, both by raising funds and investing their own capital. But most got clobbered when the latest downturn hit. The collapse of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc</span>. in 2008 was partly due to bad real-estate deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Msref's biggest fund remains troubled. It has lost about 74% of its value as of September, according to reports from the <span class="companylink">California State Teachers' Retirement System</span>, an investor in the fund. Soured Msref investments include such properties as a Hawaiian luxury resort and San Francisco office buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other big banks that suffered similar losses look to be retreating from the business. <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>.'s Whitehall program, for example, hasn't tried to raise any new property funds since the crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new management team at Msref has been getting high marks from investors for how it has handled what is now a $4 billion fund that <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> raised just before the downturn. Its investments have included major shopping malls in Moscow and St. Petersburg, Russia, for which the fund paid a combined $3.3 billion. The fund and a partner also bought a Manhattan office building known as the Toy Building and is converting it into a condominium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That fund, which didn't begin investing until after property markets crashed, has been returning about 20% a year, according to people briefed on the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Msref is under pressure to begin fundraising again if it wants to continue investing. The investment period for Msref' most-recent fund set to expire at the end of June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One obstacle facing <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> is the so-called Volcker rule, which is expected to prohibit banks from putting more than 3% of firm money into funds. That will make it tougher for banks to compete with private-equity firms that don't face such a rule. Many investors like firms to make significant investments in their own real-estate funds so that managers have a financial stake.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos </div><div>1095 words</div><div>29 May 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices surged during the first quarter at their fastest pace in nearly seven years, the latest sign of a sustained warm-up in an economic recovery that has otherwise been marked by starts and stops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing-market revival -- and an accompanying report on consumer confidence -- adds new grist for a debate inside the Federal Reserve about how far to push its easy-money policies, including an $85 billion-a-month bond-buying program which has helped to keep mortgage rates near historic lows, boosted asset prices and begun to stimulate hiring and spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed officials say they have been considering when to wind down the program. Signs of a stronger housing market could give confidence to officials who want to be sure that the economy can stand on its own, without the bond buying. Still, they have been reluctant to get too enthusiastic about signs of an upturn, in part because the economy has disappointed before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest reports were big factors driving financial markets Tuesday. Stock investors, encouraged by the strong data, sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a new high. At the same time, yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note climbed to 2.132%, the highest level in 13 months. Bond yields rise as prices fall, and the gain could have been a response to strong data -- and also the prospect of a less active Fed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The data we're seeing tells the Fed we're moving in the right direction, but I don't know if it's enough to really have the Fed scale back what they're doing," said Scott Buchta, head of fixed-income strategy at Brean Capital LLC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market reaction reflected rising optimism that the U.S. economy has shaken off a potential spring slowdown and is on track for steady gains. Home prices in March rose 10.2% from a year earlier, the largest annual gain since prices began to fall in 2006, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller national index released Tuesday. Prices increased 1.2% in the first quarter, the first increase for the typically slower winter period since 2006. In a separate report, the Conference Board, a private research group, said Tuesday that its index of consumer confidence in May increased to the highest level since February 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of home-price gains has raised concerns among some economists over whether low mortgage rates have stimulated unsustainable home-price inflation -- the proverbial bubble that some critics of Fed policies have feared. The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage, which is closely tied to yields on the 10-year Treasury, rose to 3.9% on Tuesday, the highest level in a year, according to HSH.com, a financial publisher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At current interest rates, homes would still be affordable even if prices rose by 20% from their current levels, said John Burns, chief executive of a home-builder consulting firm in Irvine, Calif. "But what happens when [mortgage] rates go back to 7%? We're going to have a bust." He added, "If I were the Fed, I would stop buying mortgage-backed securities today."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The worries about rapid price growth look especially founded in more expensive markets such as San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego that have witnessed double-digit price gains over the past year. While home prices still look cheap on a historical basis, "the trouble is that that impression is almost entirely the function of low mortgage rates," said Stan Humphries, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Zillow Inc</span>. Cheap credit is "distorting housing considerably," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others say it is too soon for alarm. Price gains largely reflect a rebound from low levels and prices remain largely in line with their long-run relationship between incomes and rents, said Christopher Thornberg, an economist with Beacon Economics in Los Angeles. "Could this thing go on too long? Absolutely," he said. "Could it turn into the next bubble? Absolutely. But we're not there yet, so I'm not going to start screaming 'Bubble.' "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has witnessed a surprising and sharp turnabout over the past year, first as investors have soaked up an oversupply of foreclosed properties and later as rising rents, low mortgage rates, and improving consumer confidence have unleashed pent-up demand for housing. Part of the rebound has been a function of the slump's depths. Home prices remain down by 28% from their 2006 peak and have returned to levels last seen in late 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising home prices should help buoy consumer confidence and the broader economy because houses represent the largest financial asset for many Americans. The home-price gains also should help housing markets by freeing more homeowners from being underwater, where they owe more than their homes are worth. Many would-be home buyers have complained in recent months over a paucity of desirable homes for sale, and home builders have taken advantage of supply constraints to boost prices. If price increases encourage more sellers to test the market, the new supply could boost sales volumes while tamping down price growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are already signs that home prices are poised to stay hot this summer because the inventory of homes for sale is still depressed and buyer urgency has intensified. "There's not enough supply to satisfy demand, so we will continue to see upside surprises over the next few months," said Ivy Zelman, chief executive of Zelman &amp; Associates, a housing research and advisory firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller index can sometimes overstate the magnitude of price increases because it includes foreclosures. Over the past year, the share of foreclosed property sales has fallen, particularly in California cities, Las Vegas, and Phoenix, which have posted the largest year-on-year price growth. Because foreclosures and other distressed properties sell at a discount, prices tend to look worse as the share of foreclosed-property sales rise and they look better as the share drops. A separate index released Tuesday by <span class="companylink">Lender Processing Services Inc</span>. showed that prices rose 7.6% in March from one year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices rose from one year earlier in all 20 cities measured by the Case-Shiller index, with the largest gains in the West or in markets pummeled by the housing bust. In March, prices were up 22.5% in Phoenix from one year earlier and 22.2% in San Francisco.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Investors Ponder Simon's French Appetite --- Mall Owner May -- or May Not -- Boost Its Stake in Klepierre; European Retail Landlord's Stock Is Up on the Speculation</span>
</div><div class="author">By Douglas Miller </div><div>745 words</div><div>29 May 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C11</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of <span class="companylink">Klepierre SA</span>, one of the largest owners of European retail property, have been trading near their 52-week high even as the Continent's flailing economy has kept a lid on consumer spending at the Paris-based company's shopping centers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why? The company has U.S. mall king David Simon partly to thank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Simon Property Group</span> last year purchased a 29% stake in <span class="companylink">Klepierre</span> from French bank <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas SA</span>, one of the biggest forays into European retail by any U.S. landlord. Since then, one of the main guessing games in the sector has been what will Mr. Simon do next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Simon paid 28 euros ($36) a share for its 1.5 billion euro purchase of the <span class="companylink">Klepierre</span> stake. Shares of the company set a 52-week high of 35.06 euros on May 21 partly on the expectation that Mr. Simon will make a play for a bigger holding in the company. In trading Tuesday in Paris, the shares were at 33.86 euros.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The share price can partly be linked to the belief that Simon is going to do something, and something big," said Harm Meijer, a senior analyst at <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> Cazenove.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question is when. <span class="companylink">BNP</span> still holds a 22% stake in <span class="companylink">Klepierre</span>, and when it sold the 29% stake to Simon, the bank said it would continue to hold the remainder for at least one year. That elapsed in March, raising the hope of some investors that Simon would make a move to buy more shares from <span class="companylink">BNP</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most analysts believe that Mr. Simon will wait as the downturn in the euro zone persists. "My feeling is it will happen within the next 12 months, but not in the next three months," Mr. Meijer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Simon, who typically plays his cards close, has given little guidance. At <span class="companylink">Klepierre</span>'s annual meeting in April, he said his company is "pleased with our investment." A Simon representative declined to comment on the company's plans regarding <span class="companylink">Klepierre</span>. A BNP spokesman also declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Klepierre</span> currently owns 261 shopping centers in 13 countries. It also has a 2.6 billion euro development pipeline concentrated in France and Northern Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, similar to many other landlords, it has been hurt by the downturn. Last month, <span class="companylink">Klepierre</span> announced that first-quarter revenue rose 3%, to 272.7 million euros, from the year earlier, because of new properties coming on line and favorable lease renewals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, same-store sales by <span class="companylink">Klepierre</span> tenants were down almost 2% from a year ago, with the poorest results coming from some of Europe's biggest trouble spots. Sales gains in Hungary and parts of Scandinavia were overshadowed by an 11% drop in Spain, along with significant declines in Portugal and Italy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By expanding overseas, Simon is able to take advantage of its influence with retailers that covet locations in Simon's top-producing malls. Landlords often use their control of choice space to convince retailers also to sign leases in less-desirable locations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Simon also has positioned itself to benefit when Europe's economy recovers. "Not only do they get to understand <span class="companylink">Klepierre</span> in more detail in the meantime, they also want to see how things pan out in Europe from a macro standpoint before they potentially bid" for a larger stake in the company, said Peter Papadakos, a senior analyst at Green Street Advisors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As chairman of Klepierre, Mr. Simon already is able to formulate strategy. He may have some motivation to buy a bigger stake, some analysts say. If a third party purchased <span class="companylink">BNP</span>'s remaining stake, it could join forces with other minority shareholders and make a bid for control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, if Europe and <span class="companylink">Klepierre</span>'s fortunes improve, "Simon won't want to share all that future upside with minority shareholders," Mr. Papadakos said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But other analysts believe that Simon likely will hold off for now on raising its stake. "I'm not sure you want to be moving [further] into Europe at these prices," said Arjan Knibbe, an Amsterdam-based investment adviser and veteran real-estate analyst. He added that for Simon, "there are no additional economies of scale at this point."</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Mall's Expansion Aid Comes Under Fire --- Critics Say Subsidies Circumvent Aim of Twin Cities Area's Tax-Sharing Program; Balancing Act of Development Trade-Offs</span>
</div><div class="author">By Kris Hudson </div><div>753 words</div><div>29 May 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn., one of the largest shopping centers in the world, has landed public subsidies to help finance its expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But critics say that, in doing so, the mall is thwarting a 39-year-old program in the Twin Cities area designed in part to discourage cities and towns from using subsidies to compete against one another for shopping centers and other employers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The situation illustrates the costly trade-offs that cities must weigh when weighing using tax rebates to spur development or lure businesses. The widely used rebates often benefit one project or city at the expense of several neighboring constituencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city of Bloomington says it will use the subsidies, estimated at up to $250 million over 21 years, to build parking garages, roads, sewer lines and other public infrastructure to support the mall's plans to eventually double in size. The mall's owner, <span class="companylink">Triple Five Corp</span>., plans to begin the first phase of the expansion, which will add a luxury hotel and an additional 150,000 square feet of retail space, this summer. The first phase will cost an estimated $250 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Proponents of the subsidy point out that it is structured as a tax rebate. The city will be spending on infrastructure some of the additional property taxes that the Mall of America will be paying as a result of its future increase in value from the expansion, they point out. <span class="companylink">Triple Five</span> officials said the Mall of America's full expansion to nearly 10 million square feet would take many years to complete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It will create thousands of jobs and attract millions of additional tourists each year," mall spokesman Dan Jasper said in an email.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But critics point out that the subsidy will come out of a regional tax-sharing fund initiated in 1974 partly to prevent poaching of shops or businesses among neighboring municipalities. The program required local governments in the Twin Cities area to contribute each year to a regional pool roughly 40% of their gain in commercial property tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Bloomington is one of the wealthiest municipalities in the region. They should be able to do this on their own," says Myron Orfield, a law professor at the <span class="companylink">University of Minnesota</span> specializing in taxes, land use and regional development. "It's also allowing Bloomington to muscle up its retail presence, which will hurt other retail centers in the area."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Triple Five</span> says the state's sales-tax windfall from the mall's second phase will justify awarding it the subsidies. "I expect that there will be continual development going on here for the next 15 years," says Kurt Hagen, <span class="companylink">Triple Five</span>'s senior vice president of development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the years, the tax-sharing money has been redistributed through a formula based on each municipality's need, with property-rich cities coming out as net losers and property-poor cities gaining. In theory, the program bolsters cities that lack strong tax bases, alleviating the pressure on them to recruit businesses from neighboring municipalities by using subsidies. Local governments in Minnesota get most of their revenue from property taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bloomington has been trying to get the state to amend the program for more than seven years so it could retain property taxes for the Mall of America expansion that otherwise would have gone into the tax-sharing fund. This year, the city succeeded. The program was changed as part of the tax legislation that Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton signed into law last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, the mall attracted 42 million visitors, according to <span class="companylink">Triple Five</span>, based in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bloomington officials argue that, without the subsides, <span class="companylink">Triple Five</span> would expand the mall in a less expensive, sprawling manner with expansive surface parking. Instead, the city wants to foster denser development by building more parking garages capable of holding up to 8,000 cars, which frees up land for more stores, hotels and offices. That, in turn, yields more tax income for the city and state, along with more revenue for <span class="companylink">Triple Five</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mall of America has a long history with government subsidies for parking and infrastructure. Tax rebates, mostly from Bloomington itself, helped cover 17% of the mall's $650 million development cost during its construction in the early 1990s.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LADERA RANCH, Calif. -- Rising home prices have fueled the return of a practice that some blamed for inflating the bubble: house flipping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In California, the number of homes sold in recent months that had been flipped -- or bought and resold within six months -- has reached the highest levels since late 2005, according to PropertyRadar, a real-estate data firm. About 6,000 homes have been flipped in the state this year through April, or more than 5% of all homes sold statewide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While flipping is re-emerging nationwide, brokers say it is happening most in California, where home prices have risen sharply over the past year. Six of the 10 largest price gains in major U.S. cities over the past year have been in California, according to Zillow. In April, home values rose by 25% from a year earlier in San Jose, San Francisco and Sacramento, and by 18% in Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When prices rise, this trade works. It's not anything more sophisticated than that," said Christopher Thornberg, an economist with Beacon Economics in Los Angeles. Prices are shooting up due to the short supply of homes for sale, which partly reflects the reluctance of homeowners to list homes at prices down sharply from their peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between 2003 and 2006, investors helped to inflate the bubble by buying multiple houses and condominiums, many of them newly built, and then quickly reselling them at higher prices. No-money-down loans fueled many of those purchases. When prices began to fall, investors unloaded properties at big discounts or walked away from them, accelerating the downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The industry is split over whether the current flipping activity could lead to potential problems. Jed Kolko, chief economist and a vice president at <span class="companylink">Trulia Inc</span>., an online real-estate site, says the current activity isn't indicative of a bubble. "A bubble is when prices are rising fast from high levels," he said. "We're not there now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's flippers are stronger financially. Flipping homes requires lots of cash because banks aren't making loans to investors who don't have large down payments. While some investors have bought many homes that can be rented out, it usually isn't feasible financially to rent out more expensive properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another big difference: Many investors are buying and fixing up neglected homes, including foreclosures, that ordinary buyers might not have the cash or the patience to tackle. For their part, flippers say they are doing the market a service and are buying homes overlooked by others, either because they need repairs or because they aren't widely marketed. But some real-estate agents are raising concerns that investors are taking advantage of tight supplies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Competition for homes "is reaching bubble proportions, and I'm very wary of it," said Rich Worcester, a real-estate agent in San Diego who flipped about 25 homes last year for himself and clients. Mr. Worcester is representing a colleague who paid $675,000 last month for a foreclosed three-bedroom home in San Gabriel, a Los Angeles suburb. After installing new appliances, relandscaping and staging the empty house with furnishings, it hit the market for $867,000 earlier this month. Mr. Worcester said it hasn't yet received any offers, and he conceded he may cut the price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors generally make all-cash payments, which gives them an extra advantage over buyers who must complete a lengthy mortgage-approval and home-appraisal process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Ganem beat out four other offers this year when he paid $600,000 for a short sale -- in which a home is sold for less than the amount owed on its mortgage -- in Ladera Ranch, in southern Orange County. He made cosmetic renovations -- fresh paint, new hardwood floors and kitchen tiles -- before selling it a few weeks later for $755,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A year ago, I couldn't give them away. I was definitely swimming against the current," said Mr. Ganem, who said he flipped 20 houses last year, double the previous year. Before he became a full-time real-estate investor, Mr. Ganem worked as a mortgage broker in Los Angeles. Flippers get a "bad rap" in the public eye, he said. "Most buyers want a home that's move-in ready. We come in and make repairs that a bank or an underwater owner is not going to do."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the growing competition from investors is unwelcome news for ordinary buyers. After waiting years for prices to hit bottom, "buyers are jumping in before prices bounce so high they can't afford it," said Christine Donovan, a real-estate agent in Costa Mesa, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parviz Goshtasby, who moved to Southern California three years ago, is finding few homes available to entry-level buyers in Newport Beach, where starter homes can begin at $800,000. "I slowly realized that I can't compete with these investors," said Dr. Goshtasby, a plastic surgeon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After three unsuccessful offers, he agreed to pay $1.6 million for a home in January after the seller agreed to finance a 10% second-lien mortgage, but the deal fell through when the seller later got cold feet. Two weeks ago, he offered to pay the $1.2 million asking price on another home that ended up selling to a cash buyer.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in March rose by 10.9% from a year earlier, the largest such gain in seven years, according to an index tracking home prices in 20 U.S. cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller index, released Tuesday, showed that all 20 cities had posted year-over-year growth for the third straight month, the latest sign of how tight inventories and growing housing demand have led to a surge in home prices after several years of declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are already signs that home-price appreciation is set to continue its blistering pace this summer because the inventory of homes for sale has remained low and buyer urgency has picked up, fueled by improving consumer confidence and mortgage rates that have been hovering near record lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices increased in March by 1.4% from February and by 0.3% in February from January, a period in which sales volumes -- and, consequently, home-price growth -- are typically muted because of winter weather. Home prices haven't increased during the first quarter of the year since 2006, and the quarterly gain of 1.8% this year was the largest for the January-to-March period since 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising home prices should help buoy consumer confidence and the broader economy because houses represent the largest financial asset for many Americans. Rising prices could play an important role boosting home sales if they encourage more sellers to test the market. Many sellers have held back from selling at prices that are still down sharply from their peak, and would-be buyers have grumbled over the past year about shortages of desirable pickings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some economists and real-estate agents have warned that the current pace of gains isn't sustainable and that some buyers could be priced out of the market, especially once interest rates rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are still 28% below their 2006 peak and have returned to levels last seen in late 2003. One year ago, home prices were 35% below the 2006 peak. The Case-Shiller index reached a bottom last March, which means the year-over-year comparisons could begin to show less dramatic growth in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate national Case-Shiller index of U.S. home prices, released quarterly, showed that prices rose by 10.2% from one year earlier in March. That was also the largest such gain since 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the largest home-price gains have come in the West, including many markets hit hardest by the foreclosure crisis. In March, prices were up by 22.5% in Phoenix from one year earlier, and by 22.2% in San Francisco. Other cities with double-digit gains included Las Vegas (20.6%); Atlanta (19.1%); Detroit (18.5%); Los Angeles (16.6%); Portland, Ore. (12.8%); Minneapolis (12.5%); San Diego (12.1%); Tampa, Fla. (11.8%); Miami (10.7%); and Seattle (10.6%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other price indexes have shown solid but more modest gains in recent months. An index maintained by <span class="companylink">Lender Processing Services Inc</span>., also released Tuesday, showed that national home prices in March also rose by 1.4% from February and stood 7.6% above levels of one year ago. The index tracks home prices in 15,500 U.S. ZIP Codes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An index released last week by <span class="companylink">Zillow Inc</span>. showed that U.S. home values in April rose by 5.2% from one year earlier. The Zillow index estimates changes in home values for 365 metro areas.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jonathan Cheng and Matt Jarzemsky </div><div>975 words</div><div>28 May 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising U.S. home prices have sparked a run-up in shares of <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>., <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> and <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers Inc</span>., and cleared the way for the first initial public offerings by home builders since 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, some believers in the housing recovery are spreading their bets. They are buying shares in the makers of appliances, building materials and even pickup trucks, as well as real-estate-sales firms and home-improvement retailers. These investments will reap the rewards of an upsurge in residential construction and home renovation, proponents say, at lower prices than home-building shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average price of residential property in 20 large U.S. cities has risen 9.5% since the start of 2012, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home price indexes. Building permits for single-family houses rose last month to their highest level since May 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bullish investors expect those trends to continue. They contend an improving economy and historically low mortgage rates will bolster demand for both new and existing homes, while low housing inventory will help push prices higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recovery is in "the very early innings," says Russell Croft, a portfolio manager at Baltimore-based <span class="companylink">Croft Leominster Inc</span>., which manages about $950 million in assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has ridden the rally in <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> but now prefers investments in appliance maker <span class="companylink">Whirlpool Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Ford Motor Co</span>., whose F-150 pickup truck he says stands to benefit from increased demand for the services of contractors and construction workers. Mr. Croft says he is trying "to find the secondary or tertiary stocks that might be influenced by housing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He likes the lower valuations of companies outside the home-building sector. Ford trades at just 9.9 times projected 12-month earnings, according to FactSet. <span class="companylink">Whirlpool</span> trades at a 12.4 multiple, despite surging more than 170% since the end of 2011. Mr. Croft says he wishes he had bought more of the Benton Harbor, Mich., company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stocks in the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index are trading at 14.4 times profits that Wall Street analysts expect the company to report over the next 12 months, according to FactSet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> now trades at above 20 times projected earnings, while <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> and <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> trade at more than 30 times earnings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, not everyone is buying the housing recovery. Some fund managers who have ridden the rise in home-related stocks warn that the rally already has played itself out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chip Reed, who helps oversee $9 billion in stocks as portfolio manager at Atlanta Capital Investment Managers, has considered selling stakes in paint maker <span class="companylink">Sherwin-Williams Co</span>. and building-materials distributor <span class="companylink">Beacon Roofing Supply Inc</span>. that he acquired around the start of 2009. At more than 20 times future earnings, the stocks look overvalued to Mr. Reed. If he sells them, he doubts he would invest proceeds in housing-related companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Because the market is up so much, it's so much harder to find new [housing-related] ideas than it was at the end 2008 or early 2009," Mr. Reed says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others see plenty more room to run. Home prices on average are still 28% below their April 2006 peak. Some expect more homeowners to fix up their houses for eventual sale as prices increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three U.S.-listed residential-construction companies have gone public this year, ending a drought of more than eight years for such initial public offerings. <span class="companylink">Tri Pointe Homes LLC</span>, <span class="companylink">Taylor Morrison Home Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">William Lyon Homes</span> all have traded higher since their debuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Home Depot Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Lowe's Cos</span>. each have jumped by about 60% over the past 12 months, while some investors have fanned out into manufacturers of roofing, floorboards, drywall and faucets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For years, we've seen no interest in families remodeling their kitchens, adding a new bedroom or putting a new deck out there," says Ragen Stienke, who manages about $3 billion in assets at Dallas-based Westwood Holdings Group. Now, he says, "We're looking for companies that will benefit from homeowners deciding that their home will be worth more in a year or two, so they want to invest in it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As that changes, Mr. Stienke says he sees more gains ahead for stocks such as plumbing-supplies company <span class="companylink">Watts Water Technologies Inc</span>. and backyard-decking-systems maker Trex Co.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They aren't the only potential beneficiaries. <span class="companylink">Ply Gem Holdings Inc</span>., which makes siding, fencing, doors and other housing materials, has risen 12% since its IPO priced late Wednesday above its expected range. Plywood maker <span class="companylink">Boise Cascade Co</span>. has rallied 39% since its February debut and also priced above projections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mitch Rubin, chief investment officer at New York-based RiverPark Funds, which manages $1.6 billion, expects U.S. home prices and sales volumes to rise back to historical norms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So Mr. Rubin bought shares of <span class="companylink">Realogy Holdings Corp</span>., the world's largest franchiser of residential real-estate brokerages, after the company's October initial public offering. <span class="companylink">Realogy</span> takes a cut of the commissions that brokers operating under the Century 21 and Coldwell Banker brands earn on home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are a lot of derivative plays on housing, but this is a superdirect play," Mr. Rubin says, arguing that the shares benefit from both rising prices and transaction volume.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Brown Advisory, which oversees $33 billion in assets, analyst Kevin O'Keefe has been buying regional-banking stocks such as <span class="companylink">SunTrust Banks Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Synovus Financial Corp</span>., betting the firms' balance sheets will improve as homes backing loans rise in value. "The housing market is one of the best investible themes out there for 2013 and for 2014 as well," Mr. O'Keefe says.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Josh Barbanel </div><div>1446 words</div><div>28 May 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A17</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House prices in the New York City suburbs, after a six-year roller coaster ride in which they lost roughly a quarter of their value, are climbing again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strongest rises were in the southwest Connecticut and northern New Jersey, while the recovery is weaker in parts of Long Island, where foreclosures still weigh on home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers who have been waiting have jumped back in, creating bidding wars for many desirable properties, brokers say. The number of new contracts signed is up; some homes are selling in a few days, often with multiple offers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Market reports show that median home prices hit a bottom in late 2011 or early 2012 in northern New Jersey, New York's Westchester County and Long Island and Fairfield County in Connecticut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last two quarters, the market has risen out of the doldrums: Prices are up in all four markets from a year earlier. The second quarter also is off to a strong start.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Across the board, it is on fire," said Jeffrey G. Otteau, a New Jersey-based appraiser and founder of Otteau Valuation Group. "Buyers today once again feel a sense of urgency. Buyers are now convinced that waiting they will pay more."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Elizabeth Lee first saw the gingerbread Tudor house in Mount Vernon in Westchester County, in near-perfect condition with four bedrooms, a sunroom and a stone fireplace, she knew she had to move quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We were picking up on the buzz that it was a good time to buy because the market was moving," said Ms. Lee, a saleswoman at the Chanel Boutique at the <span class="companylink">Saks Fifth Avenue</span> department store in Greenwich, Conn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five days after the listing appeared in late April, Ms. Lee and her partner had their offer -- which she said was close to the asking price of $719,000 -- accepted by the seller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her broker, Mary Claire White of Houlihan Lawrence, said the same pattern can be seen across the board, "from high-end stuff to foreclosures."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The properties that are offered at good prices and in good condition are moving quickly," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts attribute the bump to improved confidence in the economic recovery, signs of job growth, low home prices and historically low mortgage interest rates. The rental market also is tight and rents are rising, giving people looking for space fewer alternatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Otteau frets that the market is rising so fast that it could be the beginning of a new housing bubble that could burst if interest rates begin rising before robust job creation returns. Increased mortgage rates reduce the purchasing power of buyers and can dampen prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Over the last year we have gone from the question of whether the recovery is real to whether it is moving too quickly," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all properties are flying. Many high-end suburban homes continue to languish. Houses that need work also can be tough sells, brokers say. And brokers remember how home prices and sales surged in 2010, when the federal government offered tax credits to home buyers, then ran out of steam the following year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are snapshots of four major suburban housing markets near New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Northern New Jersey</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices rose more than 3% in each of the last two quarters from a year earlier, after tumbling 27% from 2007 to 2012. The recovery began in neighborhoods like Summit, with an easy commute to Manhattan, and then spread more broadly, brokers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Susan Hunter, a vice president at Lois Schneider Realtor in Summit, said buyers were out looking, but "just weren't making any decisions to buy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has changed. "Now if the home is well-located in great condition, there is a very good chance it will get multiple bids," she said, citing the improving economy, job security and credit conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the waterfront in Jersey City, Biyang Sun closed last week on the $568,000 purchase of her first home, a 925-square-foot, one-bedroom condo with a balcony on the 10th floor of 1 Shore Lane overlooking Manhattan,</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The morning the apartment came on the market, she went to see it and made an offer close to the asking price. It had the southern exposure she wanted, a parking lot for her car, and was a 20-minute commute to Midtown Manhattan. "I have been looking for this kind of apartment for half a year," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building opened during the boom, when prices were much higher. Her broker, Thomas Pichi of Metropolitan&amp; Waterfront Residential Brokerage, said a few years ago, every owner in the building would have had to sell at a loss. Now, listings have dried up and prices are higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market is being driven by supply and demand," he said. "As soon as a listing comes on the market it creates a feeding frenzy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Westchester County</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median prices were up in the last two quarters, though by only 1% in the first quarter of 2013 compared with same period a year earlier, according to market reports by <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>. Prices fell about 30% from the peak to the bottom, and are only modestly higher now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Meyers, a managing principal of the Houlihan Lawrence brokerage firm, said the number of pending sales in contract but not yet closed are up 22.5% from a year earlier. Inventory has been shrinking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There was a sense out there that prices were still coming down," he said. "Now the sentiment seems to have shifted quite rapidly to a sense that the bottom has passed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hottest areas in Westchester continue to be the towns closest to New York City, below Interstate 287, he said, especially homes near train stations. He said he expected to see prices rise 5% to 6% in the third quarter, when many of the deals being signed now close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long Island</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in the suburbs here have lagged behind nearby markets, but things are starting to get better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Long Island, while it has stabilized, is somewhat weaker than other suburban markets in the region," said Jonathan Miller, an appraiser and president of Miller Samuel Inc., who prepared market reports of Long Island and Westchester for <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, he noted that inventory is down and contract signings are up by 12.2% this year compared with the same period in 2012. He said this suggests "additional stabilization or a modest uptick in pricing" could occur later this year, but it is far from certain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Nassau County, activity has been weaker on the south shore, where some neighborhoods are still recovering from the effects of superstorm Sandy, but stronger on the north shore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On one Wednesday in May, Maggie Keats, an Elliman broker, put a four-bedroom house with a chef's kitchen and French doors opening up on a garden on the market for $1.499 million in Manhasset, a north shore community. Close to 50 people showed up at an open house over the weekend, and it had nine offers by Sunday night, she said. "It hit a sweet spot in the market," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Southwest Connecticut</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One morning in April, Eileen Hanford, a broker at Halstead Property, put a new Nantucket-style Colonial on the market in Darien for $2.395 million. By 2 p.m., she said, brokers were calling, and three buyers had offered the full asking price. "Everything that is priced right, goes out the window right away," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price in Fairfield County was up sharply in the last quarter of 2012 compared with the 2011 quarter. In the first quarter of 2013, median prices rose 3.8% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventory is low. Since January, Ms. Hanford said 76 houses went into contract in Darien.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising U.S. home prices have sparked a run-up in shares of <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>., <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> and <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers Inc</span>., and cleared the way for the first initial public offerings by home builders since 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, some believers in the housing recovery are spreading their bets. They are buying shares in the makers of appliances, building materials and even pickup trucks, as well as real estate sales firms and home-improvement retailers. These investments will reap the rewards of an upsurge in residential construction and home renovation, proponents say, at lower prices than homebuilding shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average price of residential property in 20 large U.S. cities has risen 9.5% since the start of 2012, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home price indexes. Building permits for single-family houses rose last month to their highest level since May 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bullish investors expect those trends to continue. They contend an improving economy and historically low mortgage rates will bolster demand for both new and existing homes, while low housing inventory will help push prices higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recovery is in "the very early innings," says Russell Croft, a portfolio manager at Baltimore-based <span class="companylink">Croft Leominster Inc</span>., which manages about $950 million in assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has ridden the rally in <span class="companylink">Lennar</span>, but now prefers investments in appliance maker <span class="companylink">Whirlpool Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Ford Motor Co</span>., whose F-150 pickup truck he says stands to benefit from increased demand for the services of contractors and construction workers. Mr. Croft says he is trying "to find the secondary or tertiary stocks that might be influenced by housing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He likes the lower valuations of companies outside the homebuilding sector. Ford trades at just 9.9 times projected 12-month earnings, according to FactSet. <span class="companylink">Whirlpool</span> trades at a 12.4 multiple, despite surging more than 170% since the end of 2011. Mr. Croft says he wishes he had bought more of the Benton Harbor, Mich., company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stocks in the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index are trading at 14.4 times profits that Wall Street analysts expect the company to report over the next 12 months, according to FactSet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> now trades at above 20 times projected earnings, while <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> and <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> trade at more than 30 times earnings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, not everyone is buying the housing recovery. Some fund managers who have ridden the rise in home-related stocks warn that the rally already has played itself out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chip Reed, who helps oversee $9 billion in stocks as portfolio manager at Atlanta Capital Investment Managers, has considered selling stakes in paint maker <span class="companylink">Sherwin-Williams Co</span>. and building-materials distributor <span class="companylink">Beacon Roofing Supply Inc</span>. that he acquired around the start of 2009. At more than 20 times future earnings, the stocks look overvalued to Mr. Reed. If he sells them, he doubts he would invest proceeds in housing-related companies. "Because the market is up so much, it's so much harder to find new [housing-related] ideas than it was at the end 2008 or early 2009," Mr. Reed says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others see plenty more room to run. Home prices on average are still 28% below their April 2006 peak. Some expect more homeowners to fix up their houses for eventual sale as prices increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three U.S.-listed residential-construction companies have gone public this year, ending a drought of more than eight years for such initial public offerings. <span class="companylink">Tri Pointe Homes LLC</span>, <span class="companylink">Taylor Morrison Home Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">William Lyon Homes</span> all have traded higher since their debuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Home Depot Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Lowe's Cos</span>. each have jumped by about 60% over the past 12 months, while some investors have fanned out into manufacturers of roofing, floorboards, drywall and faucets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For years, we've seen no interest in families remodeling their kitchens, adding a new bedroom or putting a new deck out there," says Ragen Stienke, who manages about $3 billion in assets at Dallas-based Westwood Holdings Group.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As that changes, Mr. Stienke says he sees more gains ahead for stocks such as plumbing-supplies company <span class="companylink">Watts Water Technologies Inc</span>. and backyard-decking-systems maker Trex Co.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Ruth Simon </div><div>2119 words</div><div>25 May 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B7</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate has been busting out of its long slump, but many vacation spots are lagging behind -- and that is good news for buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices nationally have risen at their fastest annual rate in seven years, with some communities seeing double-digit price gains as buyers compete for a thin supply of properties. Many vacation-home markets, though, are recovering at a slower pace and the choices for buyers remain plentiful, say real-estate experts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Second homes have not rebounded as quickly as the market for primary homes," says Philip White Jr., president of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty Affiliates</span>, a franchise brand of <span class="companylink">Realogy Holdings</span>. "There's more inventory."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adam Widener, an investment analyst in New York, this month paid $580,000 for a 1,700-square-foot house in Southampton, N.Y., that first came on the market in March 2007 priced at $895,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You're never going to time the market exactly right," says Mr. Widener, who looked at about 20 homes over a five-month period. "What you want to see in front of you is that prices are starting to appreciate and the worst is behind you."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the economy recovers, second-home markets are improving, with vacation-home sales up 10% in 2012 after falling 56% between 2006 and 2010, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>, a Washington trade group. But the pace of increase is well below the 17% gain in sales of primary homes last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason: Buying a second home is a luxury. "A vacation home is the ultimate discretionary purchase," says Paul Bishop, vice president of research at the Realtors group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor are vacation properties likely to attract the attention of hedge funds and other investors that have scooped up bargain-priced homes in many markets and turned them into rentals, winnowing inventories and helping push prices higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owners sometimes rent out vacation homes, but they are primarily purchased for personal use, unlike investment properties. Most investment properties are in urban or suburban areas and are rented out full-time as primary residences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price for a vacation home was $150,000 last year, according to the Realtors group. That is up 24% from 2011, reflecting more sales of higher-priced properties, but well below the peak of $204,100 in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some second-home markets are likely to recover more quickly than others, "the fundamentals would argue for a good market for the foreseeable future," says Mark Zandi, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics. He expects prices for second homes to increase by 6% a year for the next five years, on average, compared with a 4% annual increase for primary homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think the high end of the market is going to take off because high-income households are in really good financial shape and they are in the part of their life cycle where they want second homes," Mr. Zandi says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another factor: Building new second homes is likely to be difficult, largely because of zoning restrictions aimed at limiting damage from natural disasters, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, rates on conforming 30-year fixed-rate mortgages now average 3.78%, near record lows, according to HSH.com, a mortgage-information website in Riverdale, N.J. Terms vary lender to lender, but in some cases, second-home buyers might face higher costs than those buying a primary residence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To get the best deal on a second home, you will want to take a close look at the local market. You also should assess the total costs of homeownership, line up financing early and bone up on local rules and restrictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is important to remember that conditions vary from market to market. In Lake Geneva, Wis., for example, 42 lakefront properties are currently for sale, compared with about 30 normally on the market this time of year, says Mark Larkin, a broker-associate at <span class="companylink">Keefe Real Estate</span>. "The buyer still has the upper hand," he says. "There are some good deals out there."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Long Island, N.Y.'s East End, which includes the Hamptons, there were 8,194 homes on the market in the first quarter of 2013, says Ernest Cervi, an executive managing director at <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span> in Bridgehampton. That is down from a peak of 8,466 in the fourth quarter of 2011, but well above the 6,150 properties for sale in the fourth quarter of 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your price point, too, can make a difference. In Park City, Utah, for example, single-family homes priced under $1 million "are selling in days," says Dennis Hanlon, an associate broker at Summit Sotheby's International Realty. But activity is slower for properties priced over $2 million, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As you survey your options, the following steps will help you get the most for your vacation-home dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Take stock of your preferences. Before you start shopping, think about how often you will visit the property and how close you want to be to local amenities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Alex Khowaylo, co-owner of a veterinary medical-supply company in Glen Rock, N.J., first considered buying a second home in Naples, Fla., he expected to purchase a house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He ultimately bought a 1,857-square-foot condo in the Mercato, a luxury development in the Naples area that offers shopping, entertainment and concierge services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You park your car and walk out," Mr. Khowaylo says. "It's a very active area."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying a vacation home is a personal choice, "but if you are not going to use it often and not going to rent it out, it's expensive to own a home that sits empty most nights of the year," says Jed Kolko, chief economist at real-estate website Trulia.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Study the finer points of pricing. For vacation areas, it often is harder to get a clear sense of the value of a home, Mr. Kolko says, in part because a small difference in location can make a big difference in a home's value. In markets where most vacation properties are homes rather than condos, there often are few comparable properties to use in assessing a home's value, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Properties closest to the beach or mountains, and ones that have the best views, typically command the highest prices. In Vail, Colo., "a view straight up the mountain can add $100,000" to a home's value, says Kathy Cole, a broker-associate at Coldwell Banker Distinctive Properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In assessing your options, sales prices matter more than asking prices, which often reflect the owner's wishes and not market realities. "The homes you are looking at today are the ones everyone else has said 'no' to," says Lloyd Fox, a broker at Long Realty in Scottsdale, Ariz., while the properties people have purchased "were priced right and have appeal."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Pay attention to local geography. Internet search sites can help you hone your shopping list, but might miss small differences in geography that locals might take for granted. In Pebble Beach, Calif., for instance, "you can go one block over and have 40% more foggy days," says Tim Allen, an agent at <span class="companylink">Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reno Cruz, a retired executive, last fall paid roughly $2 million for an 1,800-square-foot beach house in Carmel-by-the-Sea, Calif., one block from the ocean. Many out-of-state buyers opt for beachfront properties, but those get more foot traffic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"By moving one block in, we have an ocean view, but it's not public, with people walking in front of your house," Mr. Cruz says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Understand local rules and regulations. Keep an eye out for special taxes or zoning restrictions that can add to costs or limit renovations or property improvements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Martha's Vineyard, off the Massachusetts coast, levies a 2% fee on most real-estate transfers, with money going to a local land bank. In Kiawah Island, S.C., the total footprint of certain homes, including the patio and driveway, can't cover more than 33% of the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Calculate total costs. Owning a vacation home can be more costly than you think, once you figure in transportation and other expenses. Among them: property taxes. They can be "as much as double" what owners pay on their primary home because vacation homes don't qualify for a homestead tax exemption, says Bob Walters, chief economist at Quicken Loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pay special attention to the cost of flood insurance. Some second homes could face higher flood-insurance costs as the <span class="companylink">U.S. government</span> phases out subsidized premiums for policies that take effect after Jan. 1 of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For certain homes, that could mean an annual increase of 25% until the premiums equal the full insurance cost. You will need to check with your insurance agent to find out if the home is affected by the change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Check out the homeowners' association. Mr. Hanlon, of Summit Sotheby's Realty, makes offers contingent on a review of the association's minutes and financial statements, particularly if the property is a condo. Among the things to watch out for, he says, are signs of dissent, owners who aren't paying their dues, future assessments and legal problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Consider how prices fared during the housing bust. Some vacation properties have held their value better than others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Properties that are relatively close to the waterfront tend to hold their value better than properties five miles inland that were created during the building boom," says Bruce Zipf, chief executive of NRT, the real-estate brokerage unit of <span class="companylink">Realogy Holdings</span>. It isn't clear whether Hurricane Sandy will lead some East Coast buyers to readjust those calculations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Find an off-season bargain. The supply and demand for homes is cyclical in many vacation markets, presenting opportunities for patient buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Martha's Vineyard, "the best time to make an offer is typically in late October, November and December, especially for houses that have been on the market since the beginning of the year," says Doug Reece, broker-owner of Re/Max on Island, noting that sellers might be reluctant to cover the costs of carrying the house for another year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Be sure to balance any price savings with the extra costs you will face before using the property. You are likely to have fewer choices in the off-season, as some sellers take their homes off the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Line up financing before you start shopping. Even in areas where the supply of properties is abundant, a well-priced home can be snapped up within days. If you have your financing in place, you can move quickly when you find the right property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lending standards have loosened a bit recently, but second-home buyers still need good credit and the ability to document their income and assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Costs can sometimes be higher than with a primary home. Buyers might pay an additional one-eighth to one-quarter of 1% for mortgage insurance, says Mr. Walters of Quicken Loans. For "jumbo" mortgages -- those too big to qualify for government financing -- some lenders could require a down payment of 30% instead of the standard 20%, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Request an appraisal -- even if you are paying cash. Mr. Fox, the Scottsdale broker, makes his sales contingent on an appraisal, even if the buyer isn't taking out a mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The appraisal gives you an assessment of the square footage as well as the valuation," he says, and can prevent unpleasant financial surprises if the buyer or family has to sell the property sooner than planned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Understand the ins and outs of renting. Local real-estate firms and websites such as HomeAway.com can help you determine which properties are most attractive to renters and what you can expect to charge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some areas, a pool or a hot tub makes a big difference in rental traffic. In Park City, three-bedroom properties are easier to rent to vacationers than one-bedroom units, local broker Mr. Hanlon says, and vacationers will pay a premium to be able to ski from the front door to the slopes. Some resort developments don't allow vacation rentals, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your rental income could fall drastically if you plan to use the property during peak holiday weeks. Property owners can expect to pay 10% to 40% of their rent as a management fee, depending on location, says Jon Gray, a senior vice president at HomeAway.com.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Pablo Domínguez                And Shaheen Samavati   </div><div>1034 words</div><div>24 May 2013</div><div>18:17</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MADRID—Spain's government approved a plan Friday to grant residency permits to foreigners who buy high-end homes or start new businesses, steps intended to help breathe life into the country's moribund housing market and create sorely needed jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The package would award resident status to those who spend at least €500,000 ($646,700) for real estate or invest at least €2 million in Spanish sovereign debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other measures intended to encourage entrepreneurs to set up in Spain, where the unemployment rate tops 27%, would facilitate legal residency for highly skilled foreign specialists and foreign investors who create jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Following parliamentary approval, many of the measures are expected to take effect by early next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're doing what other countries are doing," Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Sáenz de Santamaría said, citing Chile and Ireland as examples. "It's a system that has become widespread as an appealing tool to attract investments."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government is hoping to lure more foreigners to make their homes in one of the world's top tourist destinations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some real estate executives questioned whether the measure would do much to increase demand for the glut of unsold homes crowding the Spanish coast that has been weighing on the economy since the collapse of a real estate bubble in 2008. Most are priced well below the €500,000 threshold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices have declined about 28% in the last five years. The Public Works Ministry registered about 54,500 housing transactions in the first quarter of this year compared with a quarterly average of about 239,000 in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, Spain is on track to draw a record number of tourists this year—with 14 million in the first four months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts said the measure could help entice more affluent travelers, along with foreign retirees and entrepreneurs seeking a better climate and quality of life—much as Florida has in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spain's "key competitive advantage is that it is an ideal place to live and visit," said Luis Garicano, a professor at the London School of Economics. "Thus it needs to make all possible reforms to attract foreigners who may want to choose it as a place to retire or to start a business or to live."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A tax overhaul that lowers and simplifies taxes for retirees would go far toward enticing them to choose Spain, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other countries have economic incentives to attract immigrant investors. A foreigner who invests at least $500,000 in a qualified U.S. business is entitled to a green card—provided the investment puts at least 10 Americans to work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. businesses raised more than $1.8 billion through the program in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, and 7,641 would-be immigrants were issued visas, 80% of them Chinese nationals, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and the <span class="companylink">U.S. State Department</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Portugal last year began offering residency permits for housing purchases of at least €500,000. In April, Ireland started two programs that included offers of residency to foreign investors with access to as little as €75,000 in startup capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a bid to grab its share of foreign technology talent, last month the <span class="companylink">Canadian government</span> said it would give permanent residency to foreigners who start a business in Canada with Canadian venture capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid a backlog of applications, Canada last July put on hold a measure that offered residency to people with a net worth greater than C$1.6 million ($1.55 million) who effectively lent Ottawa C$800,000 to invest in the country for five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some real estate executives said the impact of the Spanish government's home-buying incentives would be limited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ángel Serrano, general business director for real estate consultancy <span class="companylink">Aguirre Newman</span> in Spain, estimated that less than 5% of the country's nearly 700,000 new, unsold homes might exceed the €500,000 threshold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average price of bank-repossessed homes is around €130,000, said Nicolás Llari de Sangenis, director of banking assets for property services agency <span class="companylink">Savills PLC</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of the threshold, "there won't be a significant impact in terms of stock absorption," Mr. Llari de Sangenis said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of non-resident foreigners buying homes is growing but still represented just 1.5% of transactions in the first quarter of this year, according to the Public Works Ministry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than half the new, vacant homes are in Spain's coastal regions, the government said. Local real-estate agents say Chinese and Russian nationals are showing strong interest, especially in wealthy, resort-filled beach areas such as Marbella in southern Spain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As advance word of the new initiative spread in Russia in recent months, Oleg Lemeshko, who works for Moscow-based Elma Global Co. Ltd. helping clients navigate residency and citizenship petitions, said he received about 10 inquiries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Multimillion-dollar mansions with landscaped gardens, grand entrances and expansive swimming pools dot the mountainside overlooking Spain's Mediterranean coast. Instead of fruits and vegetables, golf balls are sold by the side of the road in an area with about 30 golf courses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Russians know how to invest money, and there are a lot of them moving here now because it's a time of opportunity," said Anna Bukreyeva, a 33-year-old pianist from Voronezh, Russia, who moved to Marbella about 10 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Costa del Sol or Sun Coast, as the area is called, lures Russians for its climate and top-notch British schools, she added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Diego Parra, a real estate agent in the area, said he used to focus on Northern European clients, but demand from there has softened lately as Southern Europe's economic malaise has spread northward. Recently he hired a Russian speaker at his agency, GM Premium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The crisis means no one is buying in Spain," he said. "We have to look outside."</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">New Homes Hit Record as Builders Cap Supply; Sales Rise 2.3% as Buyer Demand Picks Up</span>
</div><div class="author">By Robbie Whelan   </div><div>703 words</div><div>24 May 2013</div><div>03:14</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home buyers are paying more for newly built homes than they ever have, as U.S. home builders continue pushing up prices and limiting the number of properties hitting the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported Thursday that the median price of a new home hit $271,600 in April, while the average new-home price reached $330,800, both record highs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price gain for new homes comes amid a spring selling season—typically the most crucial time of year for builders, as families rush to buy new homes before the next school year—that has plodded along at a steady pace. Thursday's new-home sales report showed that builders were on pace in April to sell 454,000 homes this year, up 2.3% from March and up 29% compared to the same month last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, Thursday's numbers don't mean new-home prices have returned to peak levels in all markets. In many markets, rising new-home prices reflect the fact that builders are selling fewer lower-priced starter homes and more move-up homes, which tend to be more expensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average and median prices for April are based on 45,000 signed contracts. In the month of April 2006, when median new home prices were nearly as high as they are today, builders sold 100,000 homes. Nationally, home prices stood 29% below their 2006 peak, according to the most recent S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the gains in sale volume have been relatively strong, some building-company executives and market experts say that sales aren't as strong as they could be because some builders are deliberately holding back sales as a way to control supply and maximize prices. There were 156,000 new homes for sale in April, adjusted for seasonality, the report said, representing a 4.1-month supply of homes at the current sales pace—slightly above the lowest level of inventory in more than eight years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There was a time, as recently as six months ago, when builders were scrambling to do anything they could to sell a home," said David Rice, a former executive at <span class="companylink">Pulte Homes</span> and now president of New Home Star, a Chicago company that provides sales services for builders. "In the past three months, they've really taken their feet off the gas pedal."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a May 13 client report, housing-research firm Zelman &amp; Associates noted that 60% of builders questioned in a recent survey said they had intentionally slowed sales pace in at least one community in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders are focusing on pricing over sales volume in part because costs for land, labor and materials like lumber, concrete and drywall boards are rising. Land prices in particular have jumped because land developers—the companies that install sidewalks, pipes and other infrastructure—were largely dormant for most of the downturn, leading to a shortage of builder-ready lots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan Jaffe, chief operating officer of <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>., the country's third-largest builder by volume, told analysts in a March conference call that because of land shortages, <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> is in many communities deliberately keeping its sales pace slow to "suppress it below what the market would demand." As a result, "we are seeing more significant price increases," Mr. Jaffe said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other public builders, including <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> have reported sharp price increases in recent earnings reports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, Toll, the largest builder of luxury homes in the U.S., reported that quarterly profits were up 46% from a year earlier, and that the average price of a Toll home had risen by $26,000 in the quarter, to $577,000. Toll's chief executive, Douglas Yearley, told analysts in a conference call that he planned to keep on raising prices over the next few months and expected the company to open more communities and increase its sales pace significantly in the second half of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have some room to go to increase pace," Mr. Yearley said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Lauren Schuker Blum and Craig Karmin </div><div>2354 words</div><div>24 May 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bidding wars are breaking out. Foreign buyers are moving in. A new wave of contemporary architecture is taking hold. And a growing class of tech executives is helping to fuel the boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this is happening in Washington, D.C., a town known for its relative affordability compared with cities such as New York and San Francisco, and for architecture about as exciting as its fashion sense. Today, home prices in Washington and its surrounding suburbs are rapidly rising to new levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As other American cities have been buffeted by an uneven economy, Washington's property market has been buoyed two forces specific to the capital city: a surge of federal contractors and a rising tide of government spending. The result: what real-estate agents and developers are calling an unprecedented real-estate surge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Buyers are clamoring for high-end product, and homes are selling in a day," says Chris Ballard, principal and founder of real-estate firm McWilliams Ballard. "We are getting all-cash offers with no contingencies on lots of properties -- stuff we would have never seen a year ago."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the first four months of this year, 11 homes in the D.C. metro area -- which includes the District of Columbia, the city of Alexandria, Va., Virginia's Arlington and Fairfax counties and Maryland's Montgomery County, among others -- sold for more than $5 million, according to Metropolitan Regional Information Systems. That's more than three times the number that sold during the same four-month period last year. Homes priced over $1 million saw a 32% rise over the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kip Knudson, who relocated last year to Washington to run state and federal relations for the governor of Alaska, says he and his wife looked at more than a dozen houses in the city but other buyers snapped them up before the couple could make a successful offer. So when the couple spied an "open house" sign on the lawn of a 1920s-era brick row house on Capitol Hill, and learned that more than 300 people had attended the open house, they immediately offered the full asking price of $1.195 million for the 2,500-square-foot, four-bedroom house with modern interiors. "Our thinking was to make an offer first, then figure out where to get the money second," Mr. Knudson says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A number of factors are driving the real-estate renaissance. First is a dramatic lack of housing inventory. There are 72% fewer active listings in the entire D.C. metro area now compared with five years ago. In 2007, there were nearly 20,000 new condos on the market. Today, there are fewer than 3,000 units under construction or being marketed, according to real-estate research company Delta Associates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Washington's economy -- which was never hit as hard during the recession as other major U.S. cities -- is flourishing. From 2007 through 2012, the local economy expanded 7.6%, compared with the nation's growth of 5.4%, according to economist Stephen Fuller of <span class="companylink">George Mason University</span>. Federal procurement spending in the Washington area increased by 182% from 2000 through 2010, which has led to an influx of contractors, lawyers and consultants. Overall, the area saw a population increase of 776,280 between 2000 and 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several large companies have also moved their headquarters to the D.C. area over the past several years, including defense contractor <span class="companylink">Northrop Grumman</span>, which moved from Los Angeles in 2011. <span class="companylink">Volkswagen Group</span> of America relocated in 2008 from a suburb of Detroit. Bentley, also part of <span class="companylink">Volkswagen Group</span>, moved from Boston in January, while Hilton, SAIC, and CSC have all moved recently from Southern California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then there's the contractor effect. According to Mr. Fuller, annual government spending on federal contractors in the D.C. metro area increased from $12.6 billion in 1990 to $29.3 billion in 2000, and to $82.5 billion in 2010. And 70% of the $82.5 billion was for technology services. "There's been a huge increase in federal spending on technology goods and services that we didn't have a need for before," says Mr. Fuller, who adds that the spending has contracted slightly since. In 2012, the amount spent on local contractors was down from its peak in 2010 to $75.6 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government sequester, a package of about $85 billion in spending cuts that went into effect in March, is already being reflected in a sudden drop in local apartment-rent prices. It isn't yet clear whether the sequester, and its resulting job reductions, will affect the high-end housing or condo markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roger Mody, 49, is a former federal contractor who now co-owns several sports teams in the area. At 38, he sold his Fairfax, Va., information-technology-services company, which did contract work for the government. The company sold for $227 million; his share was $125 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This past January, he bought 5 acres in McLean, Va., for $4.88 million. He is planning to build a 16,000-square-foot, French-Normandy style home with a large lawn and pool on the site, which has panoramic views of the Potomac. Mr. Mody estimates spending $13 million to $15 million on the project, including the land. The house will be complete by late summer 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"More and more people like me are building now," says Mr. Mody. "You can see that architects and builders who were desperately trying just to break even two or three years ago are now incredibly busy and get offered more projects than they can take on."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">D.C.'s tech scene has also exploded. The number of jobs for engineers, technicians, scientists and those in the computer and math occupations grew by 19.5% from 2001 to 2013 in the D.C. metro area, according to Economic Modeling Specialists, an employment-data firm. In California, by contrast, employment in those professions was flat during that time. In the country overall, it grew by 3.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tim O'Shaughnessy, who founded the company now known as <span class="companylink">LivingSocial</span> in 2007, three years after he graduated from Georgetown, has remained in Washington rather move his company to Silicon Valley or New York. The district has offered his company as much as $32 million worth of tax breaks beginning in 2015 if <span class="companylink">LivingSocial</span> keeps its headquarters in Washington and hires a certain number of local employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Mr. O'Shaughnessy and his wife, Laura, bought a Kalorama Heights home for $2.15 million. The four-bedroom, four-bathroom Victorian townhouse has a rooftop deck, and an au pair suite, and is 4,305 square feet -- more than 2,000 square feet larger than the townhouse they sold for $1.24 million, also last year. Mr. O'Shaughnessy declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign buyers, who long overlooked D.C. in favor of New York or Miami, are now beginning to purchase in the Washington area, brokers say. Adam Flatto, president of Georgetown Co., one of the developers behind the new Four Seasons Residences -- 70 luxury condo units on the site of a former Georgetown heating plant, expected to be completed in 2016 -- says about half of the inquiries he has received about the project are on behalf of buyers from abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city is also becoming safer, though longtime residents complain that traffic congestion is worse and prices for parking are rising. Abandoned storefronts and burned-out buildings are being converted into condos. While it used to be dangerous to walk a few blocks to a nightclub in Logan Circle, that neighborhood is now known for its sprawling Whole Foods grocery store.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Washington has always had the potential to be a truly world-class city, but in recent years it has really come to life in a way that we have never seen before," says Brad Nelson of TTR Sotheby's International Realty, a Washington firm that sold nearly $1.3 billion worth of residential real estate in 2012, a 51% increase from the year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all of the District is thriving, however. Much of the city remains home to poor neighborhoods with dilapidated housing, and recent gentrification in parts of Washington has pushed some working-class residents to the outskirts of the metro area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the area's more-affluent neighborhoods, luxury-condo developers from around the country are arriving in droves. Houston-based Hines is developing CityCenterDC, a 10-acre development downtown with 216 high-end condos and more than 60 shops and restaurants, including one from three-star Michelin chef Daniel Boulud. Georgetown Co., co-developer of the Four Seasons Residences, is based in New York and built Frank Gehry's IAC building there. The Quarry in Bethesda, Md., will have condos with 10-foot ceilings, hearthstone fireplaces and private elevators. Although the building doesn't open for another two years, it is already 30% sold; prices range from $1.8 million to $4.6 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The condos at CityCenterDC were designed by Foster + Partners, the British firm led by Norman Foster that built the Millennium Bridge in London. The spaces feature the sort of fixtures common in Manhattan or Miami, such as European-white-oak hardwood floors and kitchens with Molteni cabinetry. A penthouse in the building recently fetched $3.2 million, or $1,470 a square foot -- one of the highest prices ever in the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dan Riordan, president of residential development for <span class="companylink">Turnberry Associates</span>, a Miami-based development company, says he moved to Washington a few years ago after seeing a gap in the market for modern, high-rise luxury condos. "I felt like, if we built it -- they would come," he says. "And they did."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George W. Bush's younger brother Marvin Bush and Jonathan Browning, chief executive of <span class="companylink">Volkswagen Group</span> of America, both live in the building, Turnberry Tower, an all-glass tower with 250 units that sold out for an average of over $700 per square foot with upper levels of the tower averaging $1,000 per square foot. The condos have floor-to-ceiling windows and direct elevator access.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The largest unit in the building went for $5.5 million to Ronald Rosenfeld, the former chairman of the Federal Housing Finance Board and former president of Ginnie Mae under President George W. Bush.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was really the views that sold me," says Mr. Rosenfeld, who spent another $1 million to finish the 5,300-square-foot space, which has white marble floors and 14-foot ceilings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A building as luxurious as the Turnberry is still a rarity in D.C.," adds Mr. Rosenfeld. "D.C. isn't a money town, it's a power town. It's much less ostentatious than New York, although that may change."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A more-contemporary design aesthetic is also finding its way into individual homes, as more young people arrive in the city. Homes with floor-to-ceiling windows and skylights are joining the brick row houses and Victorians that have long lined the city's streets. "People are much less afraid to do modern stuff than they used to be," says Phil Leibovitz, a contractor in Washington who says demand for his services has doubled from five years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last September, Jim Courtovich, who runs a public-affairs firm, paid $3.835 million for a 4,800-square-foot home near the National Cathedral. According to people familiar with house, Mr. Courtovich spent about $500,000 to renovate the five-bedroom home, adding a second kitchen downstairs with a 12-foot walnut-and-marble carved kitchen island. Upstairs, he added a separate charcuterie room with a deli slicer and meat locker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I really wanted to create a casual and usable space for entertaining, because there's a lot of formality in Washington," says Mr. Courtovich, who has lived in Washington since 1990.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Gurney, one of the city's most prominent modern architects, says he has triple the number of clients that he had five years ago. "In the old days, I used to hide modern elements behind traditional structures," he says, citing a project where he put a gabled roof on a house to help minimize the conspicuousness of large, modern windows. "But today there is no shortage of people in Washington that want a completely modern house," he adds, noting he has about 20 active projects in the works.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few months ago, Mr. Gurney completed an 8,000-square-foot modern home for Tony Dobranski, who worked at AOL in the 1990s, and his wife, Jackie. Mr. Gurney designed the four-bedroom, seven-bathroom home in Washington's Forest Hills neighborhood, tearing down a dilapidated 1922 Victorian on the property. In its place, he created an L-shaped house with taupe stucco and dry-stacked-slate exteriors. The home has floor-to-ceiling windows and two-story open spaces for dining and entertaining. On the top level, there's a yoga studio and gym with bamboo floors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dobranskis spent about $4 million to build the home, including buying the land. "We knew we wanted a modern house with big open spaces, clean lines, and lots of light, which is pretty hard to find in this city unless you build it yourself," says Ms. Dobranski.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, a waterfront estate in Greenwich, Conn., was put up for sale. With a price tag of $190 million, it's believed to be the most expensive home now listed on the market in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 50 1/2-acre (20-hectare) property includes a 12-bedroom Victorian, French-renaissance mansion, 4,000 feet of water frontage on Long Island Sound and two offshore islands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The listing marks the latest test of the ultra-high-end property market, which has seen several record-setting sales in recent years. Pricing in this stratosphere is an imprecise science, however, and it can be difficult for sellers to predict whether a nine-figure listing will lead to a nine-figure sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A number of U.S. properties that marketed themselves with price tags of $100 million or more have wound up selling for less -- or not selling at all. While record price tags can drum up attention for the property -- "a vanity price is a great way to get your 15 minutes of fame," notes New York real-estate agent Donna Olshan -- they can also lead to multiple and very public price reductions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, hedge-fund executive John Paulson bought a 90-acre ranch in Aspen, Colo., for $41 million from Saudi Prince Bandar bin Sultan. The home originally was listed for $135 million in 2006. "At the time it was a very strong market," says Aspen broker Joshua Saslove, of his client's original listing price. "But it didn't sell at that price . . . so obviously it was the wrong price."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2009, Candy Spelling put her Los Angeles 123-room mansion on the market for $150 million, garnering keen attention. British socialite Petra Ecclestone bought it for $85 million, or 57% of the asking price, in July 2011. The Beverly Hills, Calif., compound of William Randolph Hearst and Marion Davies was listed for $165 million in July 2007. It's still on the market, now for $115 million, with less land and fewer structures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the biggest recent sales have involved properties that were never publicly listed at all. Private-equity chief Tully Friedman's nearly 9,000-square-foot home in Woodside, Calif., in Silicon Valley, wasn't publicly on the market when it sold to SV Projects LLC in November 2012 for $117.5 million, the most expensive recorded home sale in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Appraisers say unique and luxurious properties can be extremely difficult to value accurately. Typically, real-estate agents use comparable recent sales and appraisals to help determine what the market will bear. But in the top tier of the luxury market there are few, if any, comparable listings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When it gets that high in price, [comparable listings] no longer make sense," says Mayi de la Vega, an estate agent in Miami who is getting ready to list a property for more than $100 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While there is no national comprehensive database of listing prices, multiple real-estate brokers around the country didn't know of a listing as pricey as the Greenwich property. An estate in Dallas for $135 million is believed to be the second-highest-priced home on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Greenwich property's listing agent, David Ogilvy, of David Ogilvy &amp; Associates, an exclusive affiliate of <span class="companylink">Christie's International Real Estate</span>, says it's difficult to know what something so rare is worth. "It's one of these things where you cannot look and say 'It's worth X,' because there's nothing like it," he says, adding that the last 50-acre waterfront estate in Greenwich was sold and subdivided in 1954.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Called Copper Beech Farm after the large copper beech trees on the property, the Greenwich estate once belonged to the Lauder Greenway family -- Harriet Lauder Greenway's father helped Andrew Carnegie start what would become <span class="companylink">U.S. Steel</span> -- and dates back to the 1890s, says Mr. Ogilvy. The current owner is timber tycoon John Rudey, according to public records. Mr. Rudey, who knew the Lauder Greenway family, bought the property quietly 31 years ago, Mr. Ogilvy says, adding that the owner is selling because his children have grown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property is next to Mead Point, a private association with some of Greenwich's most prominent estates. Wild turkeys regularly visit the estate and a 1,800-foot-long driveway meanders up to the main house, which has 15,000 square feet of living space, along with an additional 7,000 square feet of basement and attic space. Built in 1896, the main home has a three-story, wood-paneled entry, a dining room with an elaborate ceiling and a solarium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While in good condition, the interior needs upgrading; Mr. Rudey, for example, had plans drawn up to design a kitchen off the dining room, as the main kitchen is in the basement, which was part of the staff quarters. There are old speaking tubes from pre-electricity days and sleeping porches, which were once used in warmer months before air conditioning was the norm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the property's value is in the land, which is owned in two parcels -- a 20-acre property and a 30-acre property. The latter property includes a grass tennis court, formal gardens that a former horticulturalist of the New York Botanical Gardens maintains, a carriage house, two greenhouses, a heated pool with a hot tub, a pool house and an apple orchard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ogilvy says there have been subdivision studies done on the property. Part of the listing price was based on appraisals done by the current owner that valued the combined property at well over $200 million based on its highest and best use, which would suggest splitting up the estate. (Such changes would have to be approved by a zoning board.) What makes this property so special, Mr. Ogilvy says, is that it's still at its original size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Assessments made by the Greenwich assessor's office represent 70% of the market value, a spokesman says, with homes on the water being the most valuable. Land typically accounts for 60% of the valuation. The assessed value of both properties making up Copper Beech Farm is $14.94 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greenwich, a town filled with old-money estates, is no stranger to grand listings. In April 2008, hotel mogul Leona Helmsley's mansion hit the market for $125 million. It sold for $35 million, at a 72% discount, in October 2010. Less than a year later, the estate went back on the market for $42.9 million and has since been withdrawn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pricing a home far above its neighbors can be a risky bet. In July 2012, Steven Klar, owner of a residential-real-estate development firm, put his 8,000-square-foot penthouse on the 73rd to 75th floors in Manhattan's CitySpire building on the market for $100 million. Though nothing in the building has sold for more than $3.4 million in the past five years, Mr. Klar says his property shouldn't be judged by the value of lower floors. He also says he spoke with various brokers who told him they could see a list price of $75 million, $80 million or $90 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I said, 'If we go to $90 million, why not go to $100 [million]?'" says Mr. Klar, who adds that he put the penthouse on the market because he felt the terraces posed a potential danger to his 5 1/2-year-old son. "We need the impact." In January, Mr. Klar let the listing expire, but he is still shopping it around through his firm.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Treasurys Edge Higher</span>
</div><div class="author">By Carolyn Cui </div><div>703 words</div><div>23 May 2013</div><div>15:57</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treasurys struggled to climb as the market was bolstered by decent investor demand for inflation-protected securities, somewhat offsetting the anxiety over the Federal Reserve's exit plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">U.S. government</span> sold $13 billion in 10-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, of which nondealers took down 69.1% of the notes, the highest in at least 10 years, according to CRT Capital LLC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With real yield rising to the highest in more than a year, the inflation-adjusted notes attracted decent demand from investment funds and foreign buyers. Further, the recent selloff in TIPS has brought the breakeven rate, or the difference in yields between 10-year notes and TIPS, back down to 2.25 percentage points—a fair level for 10-year breakeven, traders say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As global central banks keep easing, "the risk is to the upside (in inflation), if they do too much or can't put the lid on," said Justin Tabellione, a senior fixed-income portfolio manager at Chicago-based <span class="companylink">Legal &amp; General</span> Investment Management America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The TIPS auction provided a temporary stop to the free fall in Treasurys. At 3 p.m. EDT, benchmark 10-year Treasury notes rose 1/32 in price to yield 2.023%, according to Tradeweb. The 30-year Treasury bond added 9/32 in price to yield 3.197%. Bond prices move inversely to their yields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treasurys suffered a violent selloff Wednesday, as Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said at a congressional hearing that the central bank could start winding down its $85 billion-a-month bond-buying program at one of its "next few meetings." The 10-year yield soared to 2.026%, the highest in two months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the haven market had initially attracted some buyers seeking safety amid a plunging Japanese stock market and fresh signs of a slowing Chinese economy, the gains were quickly erased by Thursday's economic readings showing the recovery of the U.S. labor market and housing sector is well under way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's choppy trading in Treasurys highlights the different trajectories of economic recovery around the world. "While the U.S. seems to be ready to escape the grip of quantitative easing, investors are uncertain whether the rest of the world will at least provide a neutral backdrop," said Michael Temple, director of fixed-income credit research at <span class="companylink">Pioneer Investment Management USA Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evidence is mounting that the U.S. economy is faring better than the rest of the world. Initial jobless claims, a proxy of layoffs, fell to 340,000 when a total of 345,000 was expected for the week ended May 18. Meanwhile, April's new home sales rose 2.3% to 454,000, up from a revised 444,000 last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, China's manufacturing sector took an unexpected downshift in May. The preliminary reading for a Purchasing Managers' Index came at 49.6, the first contraction in seven months, according to <span class="companylink">HSBC Holdings PLC</span> and Markit Economics. This accelerated the selloff in the Nikkei index, which plunged 7.3% on Wednesday, the biggest daily drop in two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One negative reflection of the auction, however, was that it had a light ratio of bidders to the amount of debt sold, at 2.52 times compared with the average of 2.66 times for 10-year TIPS during the past six auctions. As a result, the auction stopped at -0.225%, higher than the -0.246% for similar notes already in circulation before the auction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts are skeptical whether the improvement is enough to warrant any significant change in Fed policies. "While the economy may have stabilized, it's certainly not accelerating," said James DeMasi, chief fixed-income strategist at <span class="companylink">Stifel Nicolaus &amp; Co</span>. in Baltimore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have created a situation now where market trends are highly dependent on Fed's actions. Any slightest hint that there could be a change produces a disproportionate market reaction, as we saw yesterday," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treasury volatility spiked to 65.4 on Thursday, as measured by <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span><span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span>'s MOVE index, from a record low of 48.9 hit on May 9.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Tatyana Shumsky   </div><div>595 words</div><div>23 May 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>29</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Copper prices settled near six-week highs Wednesday but pulled back from earlier peaks, as worries about the future of the Federal Reserve's monetary stimulus tempered the supportive influence of stronger U.S. home-sales data and disruptions to the copper supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most actively traded contract, for July delivery, settled 3.70 cents, or 1.1%, higher at $3.3805 a pound on the Comex division of the <span class="companylink">New York Mercantile Exchange</span>. That was the highest settlement price since April 11, when copper closed at $3.4335 a pound. The front-month contract, for May delivery, gained 3.85 cents a pound, to $3.3775.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices for the July contract touched a high of $3.4180 after Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke reiterated his support for the bank's bond-buying program and spoke of its success at reanimating economic growth and keeping deflation at bay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But prices fell when Mr. Bernanke raised the prospect of cutting back on these measures in the next few months, should economic data warrant such a decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is the first sign that any of this stimulus could end," said Frank Lesh, a broker and futures analyst with FuturePath Trading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The remarks "put a little bit of fear out there [as to] whether the market will hold up without this stimulus and what the economy will do. It's that uncertainty that makes people nervous," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Copper is widely used in manufacturing and construction, and investors worry these sectors would suffer alongside the wider economy if the central bank removes its supportive measures before economic growth is sufficiently strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These worries have kept copper prices under pressure in recent months. In April, copper futures entered a bear market, defined as a roughly 20% fall from recent highs, amid concerns that metal supply from the world's mines would exceed demand from factories and other users in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier in Wednesday's session, copper prices rose following the release of U.S. data showing existing- home sales climbed 0.6% in April from a month earlier, to their highest level in more than three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the data fell short of forecasts of a 1.4% increase, the report still signaled the housing market is well on its way to recovery from the real-estate bust. The rallying housing market has kept the U.S. the world's second-largest copper consumer, behind top buyer China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Copper prices also drew strength from reports that one of the world's largest copper mines will remain shut indefinitely in the wake of a fatal tunnel collapse in Indonesia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">PT Freeport Indonesia</span>, which operates the Grasberg copper mine, said it still doesn't know when operations will resume in the wake of the May 14 collapse, which killed 28 workers. The accident occurred outside production areas, but Freeport halted all work in the area as it investigates the cause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the third significant supply disruption this year, in the wake of a port strike in Chile and a wall slide at U.S. copper mine Bingham Canyon, and it is casting doubts on expectations of excess supply for 2013, analysts said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Copper traders now turn their sights to China, with the release of a purchasing-managers index overnight. The closely watched gauge of national factory activity is considered an indicator of copper demand from the world's largest consumer of the metal.

</div><div class="author">By Saabira Chaudhuri   </div><div>526 words</div><div>23 May 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Toll Brothers Inc</span>.'s profit rose 46% in its second quarter as the luxury-home builder reported revenue growth well above Wall Street expectations, amid higher orders and average selling prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company, which caters largely to affluent buyers in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions, has recently seen increased closings and orders as low interest rates have made owning a home more affordable than renting in many markets. Home values are also stabilizing, giving more consumers confidence to trade up to the bigger homes for which Toll is known.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Headwinds remain, however, including tight lending requirements, rising land and material costs and the possible impact of budget cuts on the Washington, D.C., area, where Toll has been beefing up its presence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chief Executive Douglas C. Yearley Jr. struck an optimistic note Wednesday for continued growth over the next few years, saying "demand accelerated significantly" during the quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Buyers who have been on the sidelines for six years are jumping in," he said. "Low interest rates, improved customer confidence, a strong stock market, rising home prices and a reawakening economy are stoking the demand that is fueling our luxury market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yearley added that Toll raised prices by about $26,000 per home on average during the quarter, noting that "in many markets as prices increase, a sense of urgency takes hold and demand continues to rise."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For its fiscal second quarter ended April 30, <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> reported a profit of $24.7 million, or 14 cents a share, compared with a profit of $16.9 million, or 10 cents a share, a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most recent quarter included a pretax gain of $13.2 million related to a settlement of derivative litigation, while the year-ago quarter included $2 million of inventory write-downs and a $1.6 million recovery of prior joint-venture impairments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue jumped 38% to $516 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected earnings of seven cents a share on $512 million in revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-building revenue declined 6.1% in the North, but increased 42% in the mid-Atlantic region, 65% in the South and 68% in the West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gross margin, excluding interest and write-downs, widened a hair to 23.3% from 23.2% a year earlier. Input costs rose 37%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span>, one of the nation's largest home builders, delivered 894 units, a 33% increase from a year earlier. The average price of net signed contracts was $678,000, compared with $624,000 in the same period a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Net signed contracts jumped 36% to 1,753 units and 57% in dollars to $1.19 billion, Toll's highest for any quarter in seven years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average price of homes delivered was $577,000, up from $557,000 a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cancellation rate, defined as cancellations divided by signed contracts, was 3.4%, compared with 2.4% a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll's backlog rose 69% to $2.53 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll shares rose 2.9% Wednesday to $37.07 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of previously owned homes reached the highest level in more than three years, with the share of foreclosure purchases shrinking, as the housing market continued its rebound last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales inched up 0.6% in April from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.97 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Wednesday. The results were the highest since November 2009 and were 9.7% above the same month a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report brought several new signs that the housing market is well on its way to recovery from the housing bust. Homes sold in April were on the market for a median of 46 days, down from 83 a year earlier. The median sale price in April was $192,800, up 11% from a year earlier, the highest since August 2008. Sales of homes under $100,000, including many foreclosures, were down nearly 10% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overall percentage of sales that were foreclosures and other distressed properties fell to 18%, the lowest level since the Realtors' group began tracking the issue through surveys of agents in October 2008</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That indicates the market is taking on "a semblance of normality" as more sales occur under conventional conditions, said Paul Diggle, property economist with Capital Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes for sale rose for the third straight month as sellers sought to take advantage of the spring buying season. The inventory of previously owned homes listed for sale at the end of April rose 11.9% to 2.16 million homes but was down 13.6% from a year ago. The figures aren't seasonally adjusted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales may have been restrained in recent months by limited availability, and an expansion in inventories with fewer distressed properties could allow prices to keep rising, analysts said. "Perhaps the rising value of homes is prompting sellers to test the waters," said Jennifer Lee, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jeannette Neumann And Al Yoon </div><div>984 words</div><div>22 May 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 40-story office tower at 120 Broadway, occupying a full city block just a stone's throw from Wall Street, looks much as it has since its completion in 1915.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market for loans on such commercial properties, by contrast, has changed in recent months and is booming for the first time since the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, a $310 million loan on this landmark formerly known as the Equitable Building was packaged into bonds and sold to investors, enabling owner <span class="companylink">Silverstein Properties Inc</span>. to pay down debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Martin Burger, co-chief executive of <span class="companylink">Silverstein Properties</span>, said the commercial-mortgage bond provided the most attractive financing terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the financial crisis, bonds backed by a single loan have been less common than securities made up of a group of unrelated loans. Investors generally have viewed a collection of loans as less risky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Issuance of single-borrower deals so far this year has reached $12.1 billion -- more than the $10.1 billion issued in all of 2012, according to data from Commercial Mortgage Alert, an industry newsletter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This transformation of the market for commercial financing is the latest sign of how far income-starved investors will go to land higher-yielding securities. Also undergirding the rise of the single-loan bond market, say investors and analysts, is a tweak in how some commercial-mortgage deals are evaluated by credit-rating firm <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Ratings Services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the New York company changed its standards for single-borrower bonds last September, the volume of such offerings has more than doubled. S&amp;P's rating market share in single-loan bonds has surged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend of smaller, single-loan deals is "disturbing," given the concentration of sometimes-riskier assets, said Edward Shugrue, chief executive of commercial mortgage-backed investor and servicing firm Talmage LLC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Investors would be better served if these loans were bundled into billion-dollar transactions with meaningful diversity," Mr. Shugrue says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shift underscores the power that rating firms can exercise. That clout has been a sore point for some market participants since the U.S. housing bust, when some investors and lawmakers accused S&amp;P and its rivals, the <span class="companylink">Moody's Investors Service</span> unit of <span class="companylink">Moody's Corp</span>. and the <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> unit of <span class="companylink">Fimalac SA</span> and <span class="companylink">Hearst Corp</span>., of lowering their standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement, an S&amp;P spokesman said that the "recent increase in single-borrower CMBS reflects both investors' appetite for securitized products with higher yielding assets and borrower demand for long-term finance in an historically low interest rate environment."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: "There have been several deals that have included lower quality assets, aggressive underwriting or optimistic expectations for financial performance, which we have not rated." The spokesman cited a dozen single-borrower deals the company didn't rate in recent weeks that were rated by competitors. S&amp;P is a unit of <span class="companylink">McGraw Hill Financial Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">S&amp;P and other major rating firms make their money when issuers and banks pay them to rate their debt, a potential conflict of interest that rating firms have long said they monitor and manage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Justice Department and more than a dozen state attorneys general have sued S&amp;P, accusing the company of loosening rating standards to win business from banker clients before the financial crisis. S&amp;P has said those lawsuits are "meritless."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">S&amp;P's new single-loan criteria changes how the firm analyzes a key metric known as the capitalization rate, a measure of how much income a property generates as a percentage of its purchase price. Under the new standards, this rate must withstand less onerous tests of market conditions, such as increases in interest rates, analysts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If interest rates go up, the value of a loan can fall and default risk could increase as refinancing becomes costlier and more difficult.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An S&amp;P spokesman said the firm's "criteria and analysis for rating CMBS focus on the quality of the asset in the transaction and long-term sustainability of the cash-flows generated by that asset."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A major catalyst for the types of volumes we've seen throughout the year is S&amp;P lowering the 'cap rates' in their new methodology," says Harris Trifon, global head of commercial real-estate-debt research at <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank Securities Inc</span>. and a former analyst at S&amp;P.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the fourth quarter of 2012, after S&amp;P changed its methodology, the ratings firm rated 93.6% of single-borrower bonds issued, according to Commercial Mortgage Alert. It rated none of the three deals issued at the start of 2012. Competitors rated those deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the 120 Broadway deal, S&amp;P rated $210 million of the deal with top-notch triple-A ratings. Rival <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> wasn't hired to rate the deal. Fitch said it would have rated $166 million of the deal triple-A given concerns about more expensive rents in the building and competition as more office space becomes available in downtown Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another recent bond mostly rated top-notch triple-A by S&amp;P was backed by a single $160 million loan to finance part of the Altamonte Mall, which caters to middle-class shoppers in the northern Orlando, Fla., suburbs and includes stores such as <span class="companylink">Macy's Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">J.C. Penney Co</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Moody's</span> said S&amp;P's assessment of the deal was too generous, accusing the firm of basing its analysis on record low interest rates, which it said are likely to change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our ratings reflect our opinion of the creditworthiness of the securities in the transaction," an S&amp;P spokesman said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto </div><div>898 words</div><div>22 May 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once a symbol of suburban dominance, office parks from California to New Jersey are being reimagined as little cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hoping to stave off suburban blight, local officials in more than a dozen communities have approved plans for developers to turn aging corporate parks into urban-style complexes with amenities including apartments, stores, movie theaters, bike paths and office space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most recent example is in Bridgewater, N.J., where a 1.2 million-square-foot office and research park once occupied by French pharmaceutical giant <span class="companylink">Sanofi</span> was purchased in April by a developer who wants to create a hotel, retail, restaurants and potentially apartment buildings. A similar plan is under way in the Richmond, Va., suburbs, where an area with 8 million square feet of 1980s-era offices could be transformed by taller buildings with multiple uses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in the suburban cities of California's Silicon Valley, such as Mountain View and San Jose, city officials have approved plans for taller buildings, bike paths and pedestrian networks, and in some cases housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Suburban office buildings are passe," said Burrell Saunders, a principal at Lyall Design who has redesigned suburban corporate spaces around the country. "We need to have office space integrated into daily life."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The transformation comes as demand for suburban office space has plummeted. In 1988 and 1989, developers created more than 160 million square feet of new suburban office space around the country, according to <span class="companylink">CBRE Group Inc</span>., a real-estate firm. In 2011 and 2012, just over 12 million square feet of suburban office space was built -- the smallest amount built in more than 20 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent recession played a role in the drop in construction, as it did in urban office areas, though office demand in urban areas, such as downtown San Francisco and New York, has rebounded better. The vacancy rate in suburban markets is 17%, compared with 12% in downtown areas, according to CBRE.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Office parks emerged mainly in the 1980s, after baby boomers who had moved to the suburbs increasingly wanted to work there too, especially as cities became less safe. Employers liked the fact that such parks were free of distractions for workers -- "a sea of asphalt to get people into their little cubicles and have them do routine office work," said James Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at <span class="companylink">Rutgers University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But office parks went into a decline in the past decade, as governments encouraged development of commercial properties in more densely packed areas near transit. They also have an image problem. Movies such as "Office Space" helped popularize the idea that corporate parks are associated with monotonous, dead-end office jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the suburbs could see a reconfiguration. In New Jersey, local officials and developer Advance Realty want to tear down about 300,000 square feet of the <span class="companylink">Sanofi</span> complex -- the pharmaceutical firm has consolidated staff in Cambridge, Mass., and at another facility in Bridgewater -- and change zoning to allow different uses. The park is one of several in Somerset County -- where one-fifth of 25 million square feet of office space is vacant -- that could be redeveloped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's easy to say these office buildings or office complexes may be obsolete, but we can't walk away from them," said Michael Kerwin, president and chief executive of the Somerset County Business Partnership, a regional chamber of commerce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It remains to be seen if the new complexes will attract residents, retailers and companies. Most office parks aren't connected to reliable public transportation, and even a makeover may not create the appeal that now draws more young people to live in city centers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Innsbrook area, about 15 miles northwest of Richmond, Va., a plan allowing denser development on office parks met initial resistance, said R.J. Emerson Jr., Henrico County planning director. Then the area lost major tenants including Lawyers Title Insurance Corp. and <span class="companylink">Circuit City</span>. The need for change became clear, Mr. Emerson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Highwoods Properties</span>, a Raleigh, N.C., firm that owns a number of office buildings in the area, has received approval to redevelop the first 40 acres of a site that will include 400,000 square feet of retail, 1,000 hotel rooms, some 6,000 apartment and condo units and 3.5 million square feet of office space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're not going to move our buildings in Innsbrook to the [Richmond central business district]. How can we urbanize where we are?" said Ed Fritsch, president and chief executive of Highwoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the North Bayshore area of Mountain View, home to the headquarters of <span class="companylink">Google Inc</span>., city officials approved last year a plan to allow buildings of up to eight stories and allow more hotels, retail and restaurants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Egon Terplan, regional planning director for SPUR, an urban-planning think tank in the San Francisco Bay area, cautioned that the transformation of Bay area office parks is at an early stage. But, he said, "we need to keep suburban office parks close to the infrastructure that we've spent billions on. It's not just a nice idea of the moment. It's the key strategy."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Drew Hinshaw in Accra, Ghana and Emmanuel Tumanjong in Talangaye, Cameroon </div><div>703 words</div><div>22 May 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A14</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A New York company halted its palm-oil operations in Cameroon amid an uproar from local villagers and environmental activists, a scenario that highlights the opposition to big land acquisitions that farm investors often face on the continent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Herakles Farms said Tuesday that it suspended work on land the size of New York's five boroughs and laid off 690 workers while the Cameroon government reviews the 2009 deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Herakles said it was working with the government to resolve the dispute and that it "always has and will comply fully and transparently with government regulations."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Herakles's problems underline the fraught legal and political issues that surround Africa's abundant farmland. Investors have acquired African land equal in size to New Mexico since 2001, according to Oxfam International, a nongovernmental organization that works on poverty-related issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For investors, the land is fertile and cheap. For governments, the deals attract foreign capital and technology needed to industrialize farmland and to boost food exports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cameroon's government agreed to lease as much as 200,000 acres for the next 99 years at $1 per 2.5 acres each year, according to company records. In return, Herakles offered to give the government the timber it cleared, which could be sold for more than $75 million, according to an open 2012 letter from Herakles CEO Bruce Wrobel to local press.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the company faced opposition from villagers who alleged the deal stripped them of their land; from environmentalists who said the plantation cuts through two baboon-populated nature reserves; and from officials with Cameroon's forest ministry, who in memos seen by The Wall Street Journal, allege the company began clearing the forest without obtaining Cameroon President Paul Biya's final permission to lease the land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company believed it had all of the needed permits to carry out the work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cameroon is a patchwork of often conflicting laws on property rights -- a legacy of having been colonized by Germany, then ceded to France and England before independence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even where government maintains the right to lease huge swaths of fertile land, it faces resistance from villagers who survive on subsistence farming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Cameroon has proved alluring for commodity investors, who have come to clear large plantations, especially for palm oil, a crop that will see demand double from 2010 to 2020 on rising consumption in Asia, according to the <span class="companylink">World Bank</span>. Herakles was among the first arrivals in that wave.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Denis Koutou Koulagna, secretary-general at <span class="companylink">Cameroon's Ministry of Forestry and Wildlife</span>, said Herakles still needed President Biya's signature to complete the land lease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It isn't clear why President Biya -- now in his 31st year of power -- didn't signed the document. Mr. Koulagna said the project was under review while the presidency assessed the project's social impact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Herakles believes its agreement with Cameroon's Ministry of Economic Planning gave the company the go-ahead to begin clearing forests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The president's Communication Minister Issa Tchiroma Bakary didn't respond to requests to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, friction has been rising between Herakles and the government. When the company announced its intention to begin clearing the forest, the Ministry of Forestry sent a February 2012 letter warning that the project cut too close to a wildlife park. That April, the ministry said it seized company logging machines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Koulagna said his ministry conducted a fact-finding mission on Herakles's farm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report, published in March and seen by the Journal, accuses the company of cutting down trees beyond its concession and employing "intimidation and bribery, targeting the chiefs and some few influential decision-making members of the communities" to garner backing for the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, the ministry ordered the company to cease operations until it completed a study of the project's "public usefulness."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an open letter last year, Herakles's Mr. Wrobel said the company had obeyed Cameroonian law, and said the company had all of the approvals it needed to proceed.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Maura Webber Sadovi </div><div>730 words</div><div>22 May 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With over 1,000 stores across the U.S. and Puerto Rico, retailer <span class="companylink">J.C. Penney Co</span>. has long been viewed as a possible real-estate play.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That idea is taking on new significance this week as Penney is expected to complete on Wednesday a deal to borrow $2.25 billion from investors, secured by hundreds of properties that include stores, distribution centers and its Plano, Texas, headquarters. The size of the five-year loan, which is expected to carry a yield of about 6.25%, was increased from an original $1.75 billion, according to people familiar with the deal. <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>. is the lead arranger of the loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Penney said it would use the proceeds for day-to-day operations, capital expenditures and to pay down debt as it tries to reorganize and keep its retail operations alive. The storied merchandiser hasn't given any indication that it is reducing its commitment to the retail operations that were founded by James Cash Penney about a century ago. A Penney spokesman declined to comment on the company's real-estate holdings and strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But to analysts, the new loan highlights the value that is locked in the company's real-estate portfolio. It also raises questions as to whether the company ultimately will move to further tap the property portfolio through sales or other scenarios. "The entire value of this company is in its real estate," said Cathy Hershcopf, a partner in the bankruptcy and restructuring practice at Cooley LLP in New York. "There is no doubt in my mind that it is in the forefront of every decision the board is making."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An appraisal pegged the value of Penney's owned and ground-leased stores, as well as its owned distribution centers and headquarters, at about $4.1 billion. That is a little more than the company's market capitalization, which stands at about $3.9 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are several ways Penney could use its real-estate holdings to lift the overall company. Penney has held some of its real estate for so long -- some owned and others under long-term leases -- that the cost it pays for space is often a fraction of its current value. By subleasing its top 300 stores, Penney could generate about $1.2 billion in rental income, according to a March report by Omar Saad, an analyst with <span class="companylink">International Strategy &amp; Investment Group</span> in New York. In the report Mr. Saad described a plan whereby the company could transform its top locations into a real-estate investment trust-type entity, but he declined to comment further. There may be some restrictions put on the collateralized property, but many analysts say they allow the company a good degree of flexibility on its real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Penney also could spin off its real estate as a separate real-estate investment trust, resulting in an operating retail company and a real-estate company. But even as the new loan is expected to give the company a good degree of flexibility with its real estate, some analysts believe this scenario is less likely. "Dividing the company in two like that would be a tall order," said Cedrik Lachance, an analyst with Green Street Advisors, a real-estate research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The volume of Penney's holdings is massive. It owns 306 stores containing 40 million square feet of space and has 123 stores with 15 million square feet on ground leases, according to a recent public filing. It also leases 673 stores with 55 million square feet. About 105 of its stores are in so-called A, or top-quality, malls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Timing will be important if the company does decide to shed some or all of its real estate. As high-end retail has rebounded, mall values nationwide are now 15% higher than at the previous peak in 2007, outperforming the recovery of the office market, where values nationwide still are about 10% below their peak, according to Green Street. But not all Penney properties are in prime locations that have recovered, and the value of its real estate could fall if its stores continue to lose customers and its brand's value declines.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Paulo Trevisani </div><div>823 words</div><div>22 May 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RIO DE JANEIRO -- Amid numerous construction projects under way in this city that is racing to get ready to host the 2016 Summer Olympics, a developer is hoping to break ground soon on the first Donald Trump-branded project in Brazil: a $2.5 billion office complex.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, with the Brazilian growth engine low on steam, the office market may not cooperate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A group led by developer MRP International has licensed Mr. Trump's name for the complex, called Trump Towers Rio and designed to be the largest office property in Rio with about 4.8 million square feet of space. MRP wants to finish the first two of five planned buildings by 2016 "when the whole world will be looking to Rio," says Stefan Ivanov, the company's chief executive for Brazil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the office market has been cooling lately after years of strong growth. In the first quarter, the amount of occupied office space had its steepest decline of almost a decade, according to <span class="companylink">CBRE Group Inc</span>. There was about 170,000 square feet of such "negative absorption" during the three-month period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By comparison, in 2012 the amount of occupied space increased by about 1.7 million square feet. "All depends on the reactivation of the economy," says the head of CBRE's Rio office, Alberto Robalinho. "We may have an increase in vacancy" if the economy doesn't pick up, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When plans for the Trump project were announced late last year, the developer said construction would begin in late 2013. Now, it would be "safer to say first quarter next year" because some permits are still to be issued, Mr. Ivanov says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Ivanov says he isn't concerned about recent trends in the office market. He points out that even if office vacancy increases, the city still has a shortage of the type of high-quality space that leading companies want the most.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other developers also are trying to capitalize on that demand. CBRE estimates that about 2.8 million square feet of new office space will enter the market this year alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Ivanov says that the Trump connection will give his project the edge. "<span class="companylink">The Trump Organization</span> provided the brand and . . . is giving us guidelines on how to build," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trump is being represented in Brazil by son Donald Trump Jr. The younger Mr. Trump has been meeting with government officials and potential tenants and points out that his father's brand carries "great weight" in Latin America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far the project hasn't started marketing space partly because it hasn't received the necessary government permits. Mr. Ivanov says his group plans to break ground whether or not there is any preleasing. "We have the funds," he says, but declines to be more specific.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other equity investors include Brazilian developer <span class="companylink">Even Construtora e Incorporadora</span> and British finance firm Salamanca Group. <span class="companylink">Trump Organization</span> isn't investing any money in the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MRP is a Bulgaria-based developer, and the Trump project in Rio is its first foray into Brazil. The firm was formed in 2003 by two New Zealand-born entrepreneurs, Myles Summerfield and Richard Macdonald.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The five 38-story towers are to be built in Porto Maravilha, an area near the docks that the city has been revitalizing. The city is planning some $10 billion in improvements including a new train service, and nearly half of that budget is targeted at Porto Maravilha.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the area is noisy with construction activity. Contrasts are beginning to emerge between the structures under way and the spray-painted, rundown warehouses that have shed layers of stucco. In some places, sidewalks go from cracked to modern to disappearing altogether within a few blocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the economic capital of South America, Rio de Janeiro now is recovering from a slump that began early last century, as it watched another Brazilian town, Sao Paulo, expand as the country's main business hub. But Rio along with the rest of Brazil has benefited from the oil discoveries off Brazil's coastline, as well as the country being named to host the Olympics and soccer's 2014 World Cup.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brazil's growth rate hit 7.5% in 2010, but that pace cooled in the past two years. In 2012, the country's gross domestic product rose only 0.9%. This year, projections hover around 2.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The economy needs to be strong, companies need to be hiring to demand more space," CBRE's Mr. Robalinho says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With forecasters predicting continued slow growth in 2013, "this year we will see who will have the capacity" to carry on the large projects now planned for the Porto Maravilha area, he says.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Lingling Wei </div><div>743 words</div><div>21 May 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEIJING -- China's currency-reserves manager has set up a New York operation to invest in private equity, real estate and other U.S. assets, according to people with knowledge of the move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move by the <span class="companylink">State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span>, or SAFE, which oversees the world's largest stockpile of foreign-exchange holdings, comes as it steps up diversification away from <span class="companylink">U.S. government</span> debt, the people said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency recently established the operation on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan to make the alternative U.S. investments. The new office is separate from one the agency has been running for years in the U.S. that focuses on buying government debt and to a lesser extent corporate bonds and asset-backed securities, the people said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move comes amid growing expectations in the marketplace that the Federal Reserve may begin in coming months to unwind its $85 billion-a-month bond-buying program -- known as quantitative easing, or QE -- meant to spur the U.S. economy. A Fed retreat from the program would reduce demand for the bonds, putting downward pressure on their value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A large chunk of Chinese agency's $3.4 trillion foreign-exchange portfolio is parked in <span class="companylink">U.S. government</span> bonds. China won't say how it invests its foreign-exchange reserves, which have grown rapidly over the past decade, but the latest data from the <span class="companylink">U.S. Treasury Department</span> show that China slightly reduced its holdings of <span class="companylink">U.S. government</span> debt in March by 0.1%, to $1.25 trillion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that Fed officials have mapped out a strategy for winding down the bond-buying program, though the timing is still being debated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The likely Fed exit from QE makes it more urgent for SAFE to branch out beyond its traditional role of mainly investing the foreign-exchange reserves in U.S. Treasurys," said Peng Junming, a former SAFE official who now runs his own investment-management firm in Beijing, Empire Capital Management LLP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new effort is unlikely to reduce China's dependence on Treasurys soon, but the attempt represents part of a long-term trend as China tries to reduce its hoard of dollar debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New York operation has about a dozen staffers. Officials in recent weeks have met with Wall Street banks about potential investment opportunities, the people said, though it wasn't clear whether any deals have been signed so far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new operation hasn't been allocated a fixed amount of money to invest but gets funds from the exchange on a deal-by-deal basis, according to the people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new endeavor in the U.S. comes as the agency has stepped up investing in hard assets such as property and infrastructure in the U.K. market. Since May, a U.K.-registered entity owned by Chinese agency has invested more than $1.6 billion in at least four deals, including a water utility, student housing, and office buildings in London and Manchester, according to data providers tracking property deals as well as disclosures by the companies that received the investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency in the past has mostly kept a low profile, taking small positions in blue-chip stocks or allocating funds to third-party asset managers to invest on its behalf. But in pursuit of higher returns, it is also becoming more active in taking direct ownership stakes. That mirrors the strategy of <span class="companylink">China Investment Corp</span>., the more-active investor of the country's sovereign wealth. CIC, which is run separately from SAFE, was established in 2007 to enhance the returns on China's reserves. Its assets were valued at nearly $500 billion at the end of last year. CIC also has sped up its investments in alternative asset classes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a clear shift in strategy, as [SAFE] doesn't want to put all eggs in one basket," said one of the people familiar with the new efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China remains the largest foreign creditor to the U.S., largely the result of Beijing's policy to encourage exports by holding down the value of the Chinese yuan. SAFE officials have said the agency continues to seek "innovative use" of the reserves.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Josh Barbanel </div><div>915 words</div><div>21 May 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A19</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the real-estate boom years in Manhattan, Michael Shvo was the most visible of the go-go brokers, a brash 30-something squiring customers in his limousine, a cellphone in each ear, hosting celebrity parties and creating ever-more extravagant sales campaigns for new condominiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But five years ago as the condo boom slowed down, Mr. Shvo shrank his business and eventually disappeared from the New York real-estate scene. An answering machine picked up calls in his 7,000-square-foot office on Fifth Avenue facing Trump Tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now -- at a time when brokers say New York luxury condos may be entering a new golden age -- Mr. Shvo is back, this time as a luxury condo developer, he said, rather than a broker. He turned 40 years old in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Teaming with an established developer, Victor Homes, Mr. Shvo said he outbid a score of competitors to buy the site of a gas station on 10th Avenue and West 24th Street, in the burgeoning art district, overlooking the High Line park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gas-station sale set a record price per square foot for a development site in Chelsea. It was listed for $18.95 million, but sold for far more, $23.5 million, or close to $800 per buildable square foot, according to Ran Korolik of Victor Homes. He said negotiations are under way over additional air rights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brock Emmetsberger, a broker at <span class="companylink">Massey Knakal Realty</span> Services, said the previous record in Chelsea was set in 2007 at more than $500 a square foot. Mr. Emmetsberger and James Nelson also of Massey Knakal had the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several developers said that the price for the gas-station property was extremely high even for West Chelsea, but Mr. Shvo was unperturbed. He said that for "this specific site," it is "inexpensive."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The vision for this property relies on the game-changing real-estate mind-set that I believed in and acted on previously," he said. "It is not just walls and a kitchen and a bathroom, it is about creating a true luxury brand, at once authentic, unique and self-defining when encountered," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shvo, who was born in Israel, worked his way up to be a top-selling broker at what is now <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> before founding his own brokerage, SHVO, in 2004. The firm's slogan turned Shvo into a verb, as in "Let's Shvo."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was admired by many brokers for his marketing panache, but some in the industry complained that he was difficult to work with.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Mr. Shvo left <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>, Howard Lorber, the company chairman, told New York Magazine that Mr. Shvo had left behind 2,500 happy people at the brokerage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lorber declined to discuss Mr. Shvo's return. "What is there to talk about," he said. "The market is booming, it is going to bring players in. We are very busy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Shvo's fans credit him with creating some marketing ideas that are now common in the industry, even though a number of his projects were later taken over by other brokers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He brought a brand new approach to branding and marketing," said Esther Muller, an Elliman broker who runs an industry continuing-education seminar series for about 500 brokers a year. "He took properties and turned them into celebrities." But she said that the steep downturn tripped up some of Mr. Shvo's marketing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a conversion of a large office building to condos in the Financial District, he brought in the home design arm of Armani to design and brand condos, known as "20 Pine: the Collection."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To create some buzz, he created a 24-hour-a-day sales office that remained open for months, he said, so that every potential buyer could get an appointment the same day they wanted one. A lounge with a bar was created in the sales office for the W Downtown, along with a curved wall with high-tech displays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At another conversion of a 19th-century building at 650 Fifth Avenue, he created all white boxes, with white oak floors, white counters and backsplashes, and touted them as "white box gallery living," the perfect place for an art collect. His show room doubled as an art gallery,</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the real-estate downturn, sales froze and many buyers focused on basic value rather than frothy marketing, brokers said. Mr. Shvo said he decided to scale back even earlier, at the end of 2007, when he realized the market "couldn't sustain" the excess of if real-estate investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After leaving the New York market, Mr. Shvo said he remained active in real estate in Dubai and elsewhere and also was involved in property and private-equity investments. In recent years, he said that he and his wife, Seren, have devoted their time to assembling an extensive modern and contemporary art collection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shvo said he hoped to turn the gas-station property into an art-themed, mixed-use condo and retail development that would connect to many of the galleries nearby. In addition, he said he is actively bidding on other development sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are working on the concept," he said. "Something that will combine art, luxury residential, design and architecture," he said. "We will have river views and we will be looking over the High Line."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Eliot Brown </div><div>989 words</div><div>20 May 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A19</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The estate of Leona Helmsley is gearing up to put the <span class="companylink">Park Lane Hotel</span> on the block, hoping to cash in on surging demand from developers looking for prime sites for ultra-high-end condominiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best use of the Park Lane, which was one of the crown jewels in the Helmsley empire, would be to convert all or a portion of it into condos, or to knock it down and build a new condo tower, real-estate experts say. They base this conclusion on the astronomical prices elite buyers have been paying for New York condos as well as the Park Lane's unsurpassed location on Central Park South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, the estate has received at least two separate nonbinding offers of more than $600 million for the property from developers with such projects in mind, according to real-estate executives briefed on the matter. One came from developer Harry Macklowe and the other came from a venture of developer Steven Witkoff and California-based CIM Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the estate's adviser on the property, <span class="companylink">CBRE Group Inc</span>., is planning to cast a wider net by putting the 46-story hotel on the sales block. The advisers have told developers that this could happen within weeks, the real-estate executives said, although the exact timing hasn't been finalized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real-estate empire built by Harry Helmsley has been slowly selling off property since he died in 1997. Up until now, though, the Park Lane hasn't been marketed widely like some of the other properties. A spokesman for the Helmsley estate didn't respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move to sell comes at a time that the super-luxury segment of the Manhattan condo market has boomed, particularly near Central Park. Demand has been strong from wealthy and international buyers looking for investments that they consider stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of apartments for more than $20 million, which used to be rare, have become regular events. And some of the units are going for even more jaw-dropping sums. For example, billionaire William Ackman and a group of investors are in contract to buy a 13,554-square-foot condo in the development known as One57 for more than $90 million, people familiar with the matter have said. That tower, on West 57th St., is under development by <span class="companylink">Extell Development Co</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of this is really people who have super-wealth," says Nancy Packes, a consultant for real-estate developers. "The demand is far greater than the supply."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The booming condo values are causing a shift in how many blocks near Central Park are being used.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buildings and development sites on these blocks used to be coveted as locations for hotels and office buildings. But now top condos are selling for two to three times as much as the best office buildings or hotels. As a result, condo developers are looking to convert or demolish and build on numerous properties that now have other uses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, <span class="companylink">Sony Corp</span>.'s headquarters at 56th Street and Madison Avenue in March sold for $1.1 billion to a team led by the Chetrit Group, which plans to convert the upper floors to condos. The former Drake Hotel on Park Avenue and 56th Street has been demolished and a condo tower 146 feet taller than the Empire State Building is under construction in its place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, a developer is planning a more than 900-foot condo tower in the place of <span class="companylink">Steinway Musical Instruments Inc</span>.'s flagship store on 57th Street, the same block as One57.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Park Lane, which is four decades old, is able to get rates of more than $600 a night. But it is considered by hotel experts to be past its prime and in need of an overhaul.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even some successful properties near Central Park are being eyed for a change to residential use. Consider 650 Madison Ave., a 27-story office tower, which has been put up for sale. Although it fetches top-tier office rents, the property's seller is highlighting in marketing material that a buyer would be able to tear it down and build a condo tower, with hotel and retail, in its place once the properties' leases expire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An 800-foot residential tower could be built on the site at 60th Street, according to marketing material sent to potential buyers by advisory firm <span class="companylink">Eastdil Secured LLC</span>. It's a "development opportunity without peers," the marketing material says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Park Lane, a change to condos would be tricky. The current building is 370,000 square feet, which is denser than what current zoning would allow for a ground-up development, according to real-estate professionals who have examined the option.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, a conversion of the building to condos from a hotel would require approval from the city's Board of Standards and Appeals. The owners filed a building permit application in October to convert upper hotel rooms to condos partly to determine what kind of objections the Board would raise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further, any buyer would likely have to contend with the politically powerful hotel workers' union, which represents workers in the building and would likely frown on a plan that would eliminate union jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The storied real-estate empire was built by Mr. Helmsley over three decades. He also made headlines when he divorced his wife to marry Leona Roberts, who had worked for his company as a broker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1989, the couple was accused of tax evasion. Mr. Helmsley was deemed unfit to stand trial, but Mrs. Helmsley was convicted and served close to two years in prison. She died in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Proceeds from the sales of the properties have been going to the Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of new homes fell in April amid a big drop in the volatile apartment sector. But building permits hit their highest levels in nearly five years, a sign that the housing rebound -- while choppy -- still appears to be on course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts fell 16.5% in April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 853,000 units, the lowest level since last November but still up 36% from the level of a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Multifamily homes with at least five units plunged 37.8%. Single-family home construction dropped by 2.1% to an annual rate of 610,000 units in April, the second straight monthly drop and the lowest level reported this year. Housing starts can be volatile, due in part to weather, and can be subject to large revisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits, which are less volatile and serve as a leading indicator of future construction, rose to the highest level since June 2008. They increased 14.3% to an annualized rate of 1.02 million in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Permits have been sending us a cleaner message, and what we saw in April was a pretty decent rise in permits," said Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pullback in housing construction comes amid reports from home builders that they are deliberately slowing their rate of expansion in order to boost prices at a time when inventories of homes for sale are already extremely low. Rising land costs in some markets, higher costs of building materials, and difficulty in finding skilled workers have also cut into their margins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly 60% of builders in April said that they had slowed their sales pace in at least one new-home community by limiting the release of new homes or boosting prices, according to a survey released earlier this week by research firm Zelman &amp; Associates. That dynamic isn't limited to California and other Western markets that have witnessed the strongest price growth, according to the Zelman report. Builders in less-heated markets from Texas to the Carolinas to Detroit have also been managing sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices have been on a tear in recent months, largely because demand has outstripped supply. Economists have been increasingly voicing concerns that home prices could rise sharply, eroding affordability for buyers, if there aren't more homes made available for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government data showed new home building fell most sharply in the South, by about 28%, compared to declines of 13% in the Northeast and 6% in the West. Construction in April rose by 11% in the Midwest.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sanette Tanaka </div><div>1379 words</div><div>17 May 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M10</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historic Rittenhouse Square has been home to Philadelphia's elite for more than a century. Now, a new glass tower one block away is generating some of the highest-ticket sales the city has ever experienced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Named 1706 Rittenhouse Square, the building, which has full-floor, 4,200-square-foot units on the sixth floor and above, opened in 2010. That year, money manager Theodore Aronson, head of AJO, bought the duplex penthouse for $12.459 million, breaking the city's previous record of $7.7 million for the highest price paid by an individual for a single residence. <span class="companylink">Phillies</span> pitchers Cliff Lee and Jonathan Papelbon own units in the building, as does Joseph Field, chairman of the board of Entercom Communications, and Craig Rogerson, chief executive of Chemtura.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 31-story building has sold 21 units priced over $3 million, more than any other high-rise in the city. Last week, one floor sold to a co-founder of a chain of gift stores for $5.1 million, according to Tom Scannapieco, president and CEO of Scannapieco Development, who co-developed 1706 with Joseph S. Zuritsky, CEO of Philadelphia-based Parkway. Six units sold for under $3 million, and four units are available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While downtowns are often associated with young professionals, most of 1706's owners are older empty nesters. "The baby boomers are selling their big houses back in the suburbs and are coming back to relive their youth in the city," says Nancy Heinzen, author of "The Perfect Square: A History of Rittenhouse Square." The average age of 1706's occupants is 57, says Mr. Scannapieco. "I think the majority, the large majority, came from the suburbs -- about 90%," he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Paz, 56, owns a real-estate and business-consulting firm and serves as board chairman of aerial-lift company Trico Lift. Both companies are in the suburbs. But for Mr. Paz, who paid $6 million for a unit in 1706 and lives there with his wife, Rachel Moore, and 16-month-old son, Wesley, the half-hour reverse commute is worth it. "We're in the city for food, fun, the buzz," says Mr. Paz, who also owns homes on the Jersey Shore and in Naples, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rittenhouse Square is one of five original squares planned by William Penn in 1683 to serve as an open-space oasis. By the mid-1800s, the city's elite began to move into the area. But by the 1950s, Rittenhouse Square, and Philadelphia as a whole, seemed to be an area that people were moving out of rather than moving into.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building of 1706 is part of a condominium boom that began in the early 2000s, prompted in part by low interest rates and a generous tax abatement for real-estate improvements, says economist Kevin Gillen, senior research consultant with the University of Pennsylvania's Fels Institute of Government. "We've been losing population for decades. Attracting suburbanites back to the city is a reversal of a long-term trend," Mr. Gillen adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residents of the neighborhood are some of the city's most affluent. H.F. "Gerry" Lenfest, founder of Lenfest Communications -- which was later sold to <span class="companylink">AT&amp;T</span> and then <span class="companylink">Comcast</span> -- paid $1.4 million for a unit in 1820 Rittenhouse Square, according to public records. Brian Roberts, chairman and CEO of Comcast, resides at 10 Rittenhouse. Stephen Burke, CEO of Comcast's NBCUniversal, paid $5.85 million for a six-bedroom, 5.5-bathroom townhouse at 1817 Delancey Place, which was recently listed on the market for $5.6 million. More than 80% of Rittenhouse Square residents over the age of 25 have a bachelor's degree or higher, and nearly 60% of residents earn $100,000 or more per year, according to the Center City District, a private-sector organization that seeks to enhance downtown Philadelphia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's a little grumbling that 1706 is awfully pricey for a building that isn't on the square itself. Selling prices range from $900 to $1,642 per square foot for 1706, compared with $550 to $1,000 for other buildings on the square, says Mary Genovese Colvin, associate broker at Prudential Fox &amp; Roach Realtors. Monthly fees are also steep at roughly $3,500 a unit, which covers a capital reserve and all building services, including the concierge, landscaping, elevator and garage maintenance. "The monthly fees are steep but they're large units. Our units are twice the size than most units that are on the square," Mr. Scannapieco says. He adds that he initially wanted to build on the square but by moving a block away, "we got more light, more air and broader views."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building's contemporary design is also a stark contrast to many of Philadelphia's historical row houses and mansions. "1706 is this glassy thing," says John Andrew Gallery, former head of the Preservation Alliance of Greater Philadelphia. "It's a nice glassy thing, but there's concern about it changing the character of the neighborhood." Mr. Scannapieco says some of the building's features, like its linear design and limestone facade, are a nod to the city's historic past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The layout of 1706 is designed to maximize privacy. The subterranean parking garage allows residents to drive directly in and out. (The fully automated parking system also lets owners call their cars from the elevator, after which the car is brought to ground level.) The three elevators are also programmed so they don't stop at intermediate floors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When I enter here, I press the elevator and come directly to my floor. Not that I'm antisocial, but sometimes you just want to move along," says resident Luana Neducsin, who purchased a $5,435,300 unit in 2010 with her husband, Dan, owner of Neducsin Properties, a real-estate development company. Ms. Neducsin, age 66, and Mr. Neducsin, age 70, used to live in a brownstone but decided to downsize after becoming empty nesters. "We liked the idea of one floor and simplified living," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other amenities include a gym, sauna, 42-foot-long lap pool and hot tub, conference room and town-car transportation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inside the units, the plumbing stacks and structural columns are designed so owners can customize their floor plan with their own architects and designers. Until November 2010, 1706's contractor would carry out the homeowners' custom designs. Now, buyers bring in their own contractors to customize their units. Layouts range from one bedroom to four bedrooms plus a den.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Neducsins expanded on the model apartment in their design, choosing sliding doors over fixed walls, and fewer bedrooms and bigger rooms. Now, a 1,000-square-foot great room opens into the kitchen and master bedroom. "We wanted a big room and natural light," says Mr. Neducsin, adding that they wanted to recreate the home that they own on the Jersey Shore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rogerson, the president of specialty-chemicals company <span class="companylink">Chemtura</span>, wanted rooms separated by walls and doors. His unit on the 22nd floor has a master suite, two bedrooms, a media room, an office and 3 1/2 bathrooms. The great room has a 4-by-6-foot saltwater aquarium and a fireplace. "I'm used to more of a house, so it ends up looking more like a house," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before moving into 1706, Mr. Rogerson, 56, lived in an 8,000-square-foot house in Gwynedd Valley, Pa. After his children had grown, he decided to move into the city to shorten his hourlong commute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He initially looked at brownstones and row houses but eventually purchased a unit in 1706 for $5,339,800 in 2010. Now, he relishes the quiet. "You can be as private as you want to be," says Mr. Rogerson. "When I work out at the gym at 8 o'clock, which is when I go, I could go a year without seeing anyone else."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This 50½-acre waterfront estate in Greenwich, Conn., was listed for sale at $190 million on May 17—far above the second most-expensive home currently on the market, a $135 million property in Dallas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property includes a a 75-foot-long heated pool with a hot tub and a pool house. Called Copper Beech Farm after the large copper beech trees on the property, the Greenwich estate once belonged to the Lauder Greenway family—Harriet Lauder Greenway's father helped Andrew Carnegie start what would become <span class="companylink">U.S. Steel</span>—and dates back to the 1890s, according to the property's listing agent, David Ogilvy, of David Ogilvy &amp; Associates, an exclusive affiliate of <span class="companylink">Christie's International Real Estate</span>. The current owner is timber tycoon John Rudey, according to public records. Mr. Rudey, who knew the Lauder Greenway family, bought the property quietly 31 years ago, Mr. Ogilvy says, adding that the owner is selling because his children have grown.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pool overlooks the Long Island Sound; the property has nearly 4,000 feet of water frontage. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Greenwich estate includes two offshore islands including one shown here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The quiet beach of the property leads up to formal gardens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Located five minutes off of Interstate 95 highway, the property is next to Mead Point, a private association with some of Greenwich's most prominent estates. Wild turkeys regularly visit the estate (the gatekeeper feeds them on a regular basis) and an 1,800-foot-long driveway meanders up to the three-story main house, which has 15,000-square-feet of living space, along with an additional 7,000-square-feet of basement and attic space. Shown here are some of the formal gardens behind the main house. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gardens are maintained by a former horticulturalist of the New York Botanical Gardens. The property also includes two greenhouses, one shown here, and an apple orchard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 30-acre property includes a grass tennis court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Greenwich estate includes a 12-bedroom Victorian, French-renaissance mansion, shown here from the back. Much of the property's value is in the land, which is owned in two parcels—a 20-acre property and a 30-acre property. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main home has a wood-paneled large entry, pictured here, and a wide staircase with balusters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shown here is the three-story foyer of the home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While in good condition, the interior isn't completely modern; the owner, for example, had plans drawn up to design a kitchen off this dining room, as the main kitchen is in the basement, which was part of the staff quarters. There are old speaking tubes from pre-electricity days and sleeping porches, which were once used in warmer months before air conditioning was the norm.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Peter Evans </div><div>1006 words</div><div>16 May 2013</div><div>10:54</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in the 1990s, <span class="companylink">Mitsui Fudosan Co</span>. was one of the few Japanese real-estate companies that stuck with its U.S. investments and didn't retreat with big losses when that market collapsed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Mitsui, which has $40 billion of property on its books, is once again going against the grain. Many Japanese real-estate companies are only just starting to emerge onto the international stage after years of focusing on Asia. But Mitsui is pursuing risky deals in the U.S. and Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mitsui's ambition and appetite for risk are reflected in a series of developments in New York, Los Angeles and London, including a 42-story luxury apartment block in midtown Manhattan and the soon-to-be-vacated home of the <span class="companylink">British Broadcasting Corp</span>. in London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Mitsui has no intention of applying the brakes. The Japanese developer and manager has its sights set on Paris as a launch pad for European expansion, according to the head of the firm's business in Europe. The company has set aside a $5 billion war chest for investment outside Japan by 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The scale and liquidity in Paris is good, and the timing might be right," says Hideto Yamada, <span class="companylink">Mitsui Fudosan</span>'s managing director in Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mitsui has a larger appetite for global risk than many other Japanese real-estate companies, partly because, unlike others, it didn't abandon these markets in the 1990s. Its decision to remain behind gave the company the expertise and confidence to continue making investments in the U.S. and the U.K.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, many of these bets have paid off. The company's shares have climbed more than 160% in the past 12 months. But some of the investments Mitsui is making today could run into trouble if the European economic crisis worsens or the U.S. recovery stalls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider the 177,000-square-foot office building in London's financial district that Mitsui is planning to develop with <span class="companylink">Stanhope PLC</span>. The project is in preconstruction, with a completion target of late 2014. In December, a lease with <span class="companylink">Miller Insurance Services LLP</span> was signed for the first six floors of the 16-story project, but the remainder of the building is still to be leased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, Japanese investors are minor players in real estate outside Asia, according to <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>. In 2012, they spent only $396 million in the Americas and $787 million in Europe, along with $19.7 billion in the Asia-Pacific region, Jones Lang says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only now are Japanese investors returning to international markets. "We are now seeing a resurgence of Japanese interest in direct real-estate investment," says Matthew Richards, head of Jones Lang's international capital group in Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mitsui joined other Japanese companies in a buying binge of U.S. real estate during the 1980s, which was fueled by a rapidly expanding home economy and global expansion of Japanese business. Among other properties, Mitsui purchased the 2.3-million-square-foot tower at 1251 Avenue of the Americas in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That binge ended abruptly as the Japanese asset bubble burst in the late 1980s, causing most firms to shed their properties and retreat to Japan. In one high-profile loss, Mitubishi Estate Co. was forced to put the storied Rockefeller Center complex in New York into a bankruptcy proceeding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mitsui retained its ownership of the Avenue of the Americas building through the downturn and even invested millions in renovation. Today, the building is the most valuable property Mitsui owns. "We came to be very confident and comfortable when investing" when others stopped, says Mr. Yamada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mitsui's goal is to reduce the proportion of its home-market assets to 70% of its total portfolio, from about 90% currently. Although Japan is showing signs of an economic revival after years of low growth, Mitsui says there are limited opportunities for investment in assets of the size and scale to meet its ambitions. The group also wants to diversify its risk profile by spreading its investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S., Mitsui is moving forward with a rental-apartment building development at 160 Madison Ave. in New York. The 300-unit project, which is slated to start this summer and finish in the fall of 2015, is in partnership with DLJ Real Estate Capital Partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, in London, projects include a £85 million ($131.8 million) office development on Moorgate, one of the main thoroughfares in London's financial district. That 132,000-square-foot project is set to be completed in early 2014. Also, Mitsui last year bought a 45% stake in the <span class="companylink">BBC</span> television center in West London, the 1.1 million-square-foot home of the public broadcaster, for about £95 million. The company plans to turn the studios into a mixed office, retail and residential site when the <span class="companylink">BBC</span> moves out in 2015.Mr. Yamada says Mitsui wants to invest "in similar scale opportunities" in continental Europe. He singles out Paris and Stockholm as areas of interest and says developments would likely be made in partnership with a local operator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mitsui has tried to break into continental Europe before, unsuccessfully. In the 1990s, the group signaled its intention to invest but failed to find a suitable target as recession swept the continent in the early part of the decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although difficult economic conditions still exist in much of Europe, Mr. Yamada says Mitsui will be bolder this time. "Our vision at the highest corporate level is different," he says. "Now, we need to expand to keep the speed of our growth."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Zusha Elinson </div><div>876 words</div><div>16 May 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A11B</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Francisco's Central Subway project has faced local grumbling for years over its ballooning price tag. Critics are now getting some fresh fodder after a new audit found contractors were passing on some unallowable costs, including for celebratory cakes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The disallowed expenses identified by the audit from earlier this month as well as a previous one totaled $1.2 million -- a fraction of the $1.6 billion total price tag for the 1.7-mile subway project, which will run from South of Market to Chinatown and is slated to open in 2019. Nearly $1 billion of the cost is being paid for with federal funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However for some opponents of the subway, this is the icing on a series of recent incidents stoking their concerns that the project's cost will continue to rise, as construction is only in its early stages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gerald Cauthen, a transportation consultant who is part of a group that fought the Central Subway, says recent events augur poorly for the final cost of the subway, which he has frequently characterized as a boondoggle. "Heavy construction has barely started, we have six years to go," he says. "I think they're going to go in the red. The only question is how much in the red."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Rose, a spokesman for the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, which is overseeing subway construction, says the project is on budget and on schedule. He acknowledges the contingency reserve fund for the project has dropped to $70 million from $200 million, largely because of a higher-than-expected bid to build stations and tracks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rose says the MTA commissioned the audits "so the public's money is properly spent," and that the auditors are doing exactly what the agency wants. Depending on the audit findings, contractors will make reimbursements or adjust their rates, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City auditors said in their latest report that TBD Consultants Inc., a construction-management firm hired as a subcontractor to the Central Subway project, included $68 for two birthday cakes in its billing rate. The audit also found that TBD Consultants included a $70 parking ticket, $480 for golf and $900 for the company soccer team. None of these charges are allowed under federal rules, the audit says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Niall Durkin, a principal at TBD Consultants, says "in general we agree with the audit findings," but adds that "some items removed by the auditors would normally be allowed, however we did not have the correct backup material on file and we accept this is our responsibility."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The earlier audit, in February, found that B&amp;C Transit, a firm hired for a design contract, included a $645 three-tiered wedding cake for 90 guests in its overhead rate. Auditors also flagged $3,000 in campaign contributions and $44,230 in charitable donations, including $15,444 for the <span class="companylink">Chinese Hospital</span> 16th Annual Golf Tournament. The firm was ordered by auditors and the San Francisco MTA to lower the rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">B&amp;C executives didn't return phone calls seeking comment, but the company disputed some of the findings in an official response to the audit, though not the cakes and the political and charitable donations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The audits are just the latest hiccup for the Central Subway, which has been the subject of heated debate for years. Proponents have said it would be a boon for residents of congested Chinatown while opponents say the subway is poorly planned and the money would be better spent on more-cost-efficient transportation projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cost remains one of the biggest issues. The $1.6 billion price tag is far above a $647 million estimate from 2001. Last month, the low bid to build the stations and tracks came in $90 million to $120 million higher than the MTA's estimate. At the same time, concerns emerged that a complicated plan to pull tunnel-boring machines out of the ground in North Beach could cost more than anticipated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It isn't unusual for large public works projects to go over budget. An oft-cited 2003 study by <span class="companylink">Oxford University</span> professor Bent Flyvbjerg found that on average, rail projects went over budget by 45%, with bridge and tunnels over by 34%. And a 2009 <span class="companylink">Federal Transit Administration</span> risk assessment calculated that the Central Subway had a 30% chance of coming in within the $1.6 billion budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since that time the San Francisco MTA has put in place a risk-management plan that is "designed to minimize project risks and deliver this program on budget," says Mr. Rose of the MTA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City auditors are paying close attention to the project. Tonia Lediju, director of city audits, says companies working on the project don't always know the rules of government contracting, which prohibit certain expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They do their business as normal, they buy cakes," says Ms. Lediju. "As a governmental entity, we don't pay for things like that."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Dawn Wotapka </div><div>817 words</div><div>15 May 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment sector's biggest mystery these days: What will Lehman do?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, the estate of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc</span>. sold apartment-building owner Archstone to competitors <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> and <span class="companylink">AvalonBay Communities Inc</span>. As part of the deal, Lehman got about 10% stakes in the two firms, currently valued at about $4 billion, which it had to hold for 150 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That lockup period ended in late April. Lehman, which doesn't appear to have sold its <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> or AvalonBay shares since then, is keeping apartment-industry watchers guessing what it is doing with the stock, and that is putting a pall on both companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the Archstone transaction closed on Feb. 27, shares of <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> have risen 5.8%, while AvalonBay is up 8.5%, according to FactSet. During that same period, the Dow Jones Equity All REIT index has increased 11%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts blame some of the difference on the uncertainty over Lehman's plans. "We recognize the Street would like Lehman out of our stock, and believe me we would like Lehman out of our stock," said David Neithercut, <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span>'s chief executive, on an earnings call this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A representative for Lehman declined to comment on its plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Archstone, which owned about 50,000 rental units, was one of Lehman's largest investments, and the apartment owner's high leverage contributed to the demise of the storied investment bank in September 2008. Since Lehman emerged from bankruptcy protection last year, the estate has been continuing a liquidation and sold Archstone to <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> and AvalonBay for $6.5 billion for the shares and $2.7 billion in cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lehman doesn't face any specific deadline for unwinding assets, so it could opt to sit on the shares. "Lehman will ultimately get out, but they're in no hurry to do so, because they have the necessary flexibility to exit in a fashion that will maximize the return to their creditors and they intend to do just that," Mr. Neithercut said on the earnings call.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lehman could decide to sell the shares sooner rather than later. Even though they are underperforming some other REITs, both <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> and AvalonBay are trading near records. Shares of <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> closed Tuesday at $59.22, not far from its record of $65.47 reached on July 17. On the same day, AvalonBay hit a record $151. It closed at $136.64.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lehman is weighing its options as the rental-apartment sector is losing some of the allure it had during the early years of the economic downturn. Rents and occupancy levels continued to increase during the worst years of the housing crisis because some people turned to rentals instead of homeownership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently, though, investors have been concerned that demand for rental apartments will decline as the for-sale market recovers. In the first quarter, the rate of rental-revenue growth at <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> and AvalonBay slowed compared with previous quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts point out that apartment-company stocks also are being reined in by the Lehman effect. Shares of <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> and AvalonBay trade at 4% and 1% discounts, respectively, to their net asset values, or what their properties would fetch if sold. By comparison, REITs in general trade at 26% premiums to their net asset values, according to Green Street Advisors, a real-estate research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts believe that, because of that disparity, now would be a good opportunity to buy <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> and AvalonBay shares. "We're starting to pound the table, this is appears to be an incredible buying opportunity," said Andrew McCulloch, a Green Street managing director.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But others note that if Lehman floods the market by selling its holdings too quickly, it could temporarily weigh on the stocks. "It's like throwing a wrench in the system," said Richard Anderson, a REIT analyst with BMO Capital Markets who is bullish on apartments overall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lehman also could opt for a public offering, which would resemble a company selling additional stock. This would be seen as more orderly than dumping shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additionally, Lehman could sell the shares in multiple transactions, a strategy that might keep uncertainty hanging over the shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet another possibility would be <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> or AvalonBay buying their shares back, possibly with funds raised from selling buildings or debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts say such moves by the companies seem unlikely. <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> and AvalonBay declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the Lehman pressure on the stocks, analysts say buying Archstone was a good deal for <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> and AvalonBay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deals "should benefit their shareholders for the long term," Mr. Anderson said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Eliot Brown </div><div>918 words</div><div>15 May 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A19</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developer Larry Silverstein was forced to shelve a planned Lower Manhattan condo-and-hotel tower that was meant to soar above the Woolworth Building on the same block after the economy plunged in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now he's getting another chance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Silverstein Properties Inc</span>. has reached an agreement with a large London-based investment firm to provide a loan of up to $660 million construction of its 926-foot tower, said Martin Burger, co-chief executive at Silverstein. Should the financing deal with Children's Investment Fund Management LLP be completed, it would clear the way for <span class="companylink">Silverstein Properties</span>, the developer of three World Trade Center towers just 1 1/2 blocks away, to break ground on the superluxury tower at 30 Park Place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Designed by Robert A.M. Stern, who seeks to replicate the architecture of the 1920s, the building also is slated to include a 189-room Four Seasons hotel. The tower is be called the Four Seasons Hotel and Private Residences New York Downtown</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal -- where condo units are expected to run as high as $34 million for a penthouse in the 157-unit building -- marks the latest manifestation of the booming upper-crust condominium market in New York. Superluxury condos at under-construction buildings such as the green-glass tower One57 and the 1,396-foot 432 Park have been flying off the shelves as their cranes have risen, fetching new highs for prices just 4 1/2 years after the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In part, this boom has come from pent-up demand from international buyers who see New York real estate as a safe, long-term investment, and have been paying up to live in tall, slim towers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a huge, huge international clientele in the New York market," Mr. Burger said. "It's not just coming from Russia, it's not just coming from Brazil, it's coming from everywhere."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $950 million project -- previously named 99 Church -- had its genesis back in 2006, when Mr. Silverstein and his partner, the <span class="companylink">California State Teachers Retirement System</span>, bought the former headquarters of Moody's Investors Service and moved to demolish the aging office building. In early 2008, at a tony breakfast before business leaders at Cipriani's in Lower Manhattan, Mr. Silverstein unveiled designs for the tower, which at the time was to be the tallest residential building in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developer began digging, but the economic downturn -- and plunging demand for condos -- made the project unfeasible and the site was mothballed, with its construction fence shrouded in a public art project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company "waited until the world turned back," Mr. Burger said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the success of other new developments has helped bolster Mr. Burger's outlook for 30 Park Place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, the boxy glass tower 56 Leonard under construction in TriBeCa has signed more than $1 billion in contracts to sell more than 70% of the 145 units, according to <span class="companylink">Corcoran Group</span>, which is marketing the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the West Village, developer Steven Witkoff and his partners have signed contracts for all but two of their more than 90 units at the high-end 150 Charles St. development, averaging nearly $3,300 a square foot, well above where the developer had initially expected, Mr. Witkoff said. The units have been on the market for just three months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You can imagine 500 appointments in three months -- it was intense," said Leonard Steinberg, a broker at <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>, who is marketing 150 Charles. "The pool of super wealthy buyers has grown exponentially, and it's affecting all arenas."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Midtown, prices are even higher. Two units at the 1,004-foot tower One57, being built just south of Central Park, have found buyers paying more than $90 million each, the highest prices ever for an apartment in the city, the developer has said. Down the block on 57th Street, another developer is planning a more than 900-foot tower in an attempt to replicate the success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Burger said that the success of other projects helped assuage concerns of lenders, who have been showing more willingness to finance projects. "It really was validation for us of the pent up demand for condominiums," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, high prices today don't necessarily mean they will be there tomorrow, a particularly difficult reality for condo tower developers given that the buildings take far longer than houses or midrise apartments. After the economy tumbled, developers of condo towers across the country had to surrender their buildings in foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Burger and his lender see far more demand than supply for some time to come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a lot of appetite for high quality," said Martin Frass-Ehrfeld, partner at Children's Investment Fund. "We feel the market can absorb this -- and there's appetite for it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fund wasn't the only lender lining up. Mr. Burger was in advanced discussions with a group of banks that was preparing to make the loan, but then Silverstein switched course, multiple real-estate executives familiar with the discussions said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Burger said he preferred a single lender to a group, given that one voice is easier than many in complex construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should the deal be completed on scheduled, Mr. Burger said he expects the tower to be completed in 2016.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Funds Bet On Freddie, Fannie Rise</span>
</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos </div><div>1061 words</div><div>15 May 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the hedge funds that made fortunes in the housing-market crash are now betting on the recovery of <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the government-controlled mortgage giants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Paulson &amp; Co</span>. and <span class="companylink">Perry Capital LLC</span> are among a handful of hedge-fund firms that have bought so-called preferred shares in Fannie and Freddie, which collapsed in value in 2008 after the companies were taken over by the federal government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These firms are hoping Fannie and Freddie's recent return to profitability on the back of a recovering housing market will lead the companies eventually to make payments to preferred shareholders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some investors already have benefited from a recent rally in the mortgage companies' shares. The most widely traded class of Fannie's preferred shares closed at $5.38 on Tuesday, the highest level since the companies were placed into a government-run conservatorship in September 2008. Two months ago, the shares traded for less than $2.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the hedge funds and other investors stand to make a lot more depending on how Fannie and Freddie are restructured. The best-case scenario for the investors would be that the government raises fresh capital for the companies and sells its stake on the market. That way, the investors hope, preferred shareholders might be paid out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that could be a long shot. Any recapitalization of Fannie and Freddie is viewed as a nonstarter by officials in the Obama administration, according to people familiar with the matter. The administration has repeatedly said the companies should be phased out instead of sold back to investors along the lines of how the U.S. unwound its stake in <span class="companylink">American International Group Inc</span>. Once any overhaul of Fannie and Freddie begins, the administration could take additional steps to sell off the firms' assets in a way that would prevent any capital distributions to shareholders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"To the degree these guys are placing a political bet, it is one that faces unimaginably long odds," said Jim Parrott, who served as a top housing-finance adviser in the White House until the end of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Preferred shareholders may need to persuade Congress or the courts to revisit the current structure if they hope to recoup the full value of the shares. Paulson, Perry and others have been circulating plans before lawmakers that Fannie and Freddie should be restructured or privatized in some form, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hedge funds have stepped up their lobbying of Congress to encourage the sale of the government's stake in the firms, said Sen. David Vitter (R., La.) at a hearing on Capitol Hill last month. "And to some extent, investors are already speculating that the companies will be returned to the marketplace."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representatives of Paulson and Perry, which shot to prominence with their winning wagers against the housing market before the financial crisis, declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the proposals in Washington is being advanced by Jim Millstein, a former Treasury Department restructuring officer who oversaw the government's sale of <span class="companylink">AIG</span>. He now runs his own restructuring firm, Millstein &amp; Co., and has invested in the preferred shares. At some point over the next year, "the government is going to get all of its money back. So the questions for the government are what will, and what can, they do with the excess?" said Mr. Millstein.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fannie and Freddie, which took around $188 billion from the U.S., will have paid the government about $132 billion in dividends by next month. Investors betting on the preferred shares are taking heart in those improved fortunes. They believe "there are going to be so many profits that the likelihood of the preferreds being worth zero in their mind is dropping," said Derek Pilecki, a former <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> portfolio manager who founded Gator Capital Management in Tampa, Fla., in 2008. He began investing the preferred shares that summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lately, more small investors also have begun to pile in, a trend that is "somewhat unsettling," said Isaac Boltansky, a policy analyst at Washington-based Compass Point Research &amp; Trading, a dealer-broker for institutional clients. He pointed out that Freddie and Fannie remain political pariahs, with few signs pointing to any political will to resurrect the firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is one of those instances where we have a disconnect between securities valuation and D.C. policy," said Mr. Boltansky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The episode is the latest reminder of the strange situation facing Fannie and Freddie, which are still nominally private entities. The <span class="companylink">U.S. Treasury</span> agreed to rescue the companies in September 2008 to stave off a deep freeze in U.S. mortgage markets. In return for injecting vast sums of aid, the Treasury created a new class of stock -- senior preferred shares -- that paid an annual dividend of 10% to the <span class="companylink">U.S. government</span>, along with warrants to acquire up to 79.9% of the firms' common stock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last summer, the Treasury revamped its bailout agreement to require nearly all of the firms' profits to be swept away as dividends. The problem facing investors is that those terms make it virtually impossible for the companies to ever recapitalize or pay back the government. Also, dividend payments aren't counted toward repayment of the Treasury's preferred shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government didn't take full ownership of the companies in order to avoid consolidating some $5 trillion in assets and liabilities onto the federal ledger. The companies' shares, which were delisted in 2010 from the New York Stock Exchange, still trade over the counter. Before the crisis, the preferred shares, which would be worth $33 billion if paid in full, were widely held by community banks and mutual funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sen. Bob Corker (R., Tenn.), who is working on a bill that would replace Fannie and Freddie with a new structure that would leave no room for private shareholders, said he sees the preferred shares as little more than a "lottery ticket." Messrs. Corker and Vitter joined two Democratic senators in introducing a bill earlier this year that would require congressional approval before the Treasury could sell its stake, a move designed to prevent private shareholders from cashing in.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Eliot Brown </div><div>902 words</div><div>15 May 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Federal budget cuts are taking a toll on the office parks that have mushroomed for years in the capital's suburbs, along with the retailers and restaurants that depend on government workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As office markets in other suburban areas are gradually rebounding with the growth of the private-sector labor force, vacancies are rising in the gently rolling hills of northern Virginia and suburban Maryland -- home to many a defense contractor and federal agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Office vacancies in the Washington region increased to 13.8% in the first quarter, up from 13.4% a year earlier, according to real-estate research company <span class="companylink">CoStar Group Inc</span>. National vacancy rates fell to 12.2% from 12.8% a year earlier, according to CoStar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, the Washington-area office market boomed as security spending jumped after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, with square footage growing more than 14% from 2002 to 2011, according to CoStar. During the recession, stimulus-related spending helped fuel some of the highest occupancy rates and rent growth in the nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now, "people are not making decisions -- they're waiting," said Michael Fascitelli, the recently departed chief executive of major office landlord <span class="companylink">Vornado Realty Trust</span>, at a real-estate conference hosted by <span class="companylink">DLA Piper</span> in late April. "It's very much a market that's in neutral."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal spending, almost always on the rise, dropped by about $60 billion in the 2012 budget, according to the <span class="companylink">Congressional Budget Office</span>, pushing federal agencies to try to stop growing their footprints and look for efficiencies. This year, with $85 billion in cuts related to sequestration under way, many private and public employers in the area are contracting, not expanding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hardest hit have been the suburbs, most notably in northern Virginia, with a vacancy rate of 15.8%, up from 15.1% in the first quarter of 2012, according to CoStar. That is in part because defense agencies and related contractors, which fill the area's wooded office parks and mid-rise buildings, have been particularly hard hit by cuts directed at military spending, in addition to consolidations related to the 2005 Base Realignment and Realignment and Closure Commission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take a glassy new office building called MetroPark VI in southeast Fairfax County near a <span class="companylink">National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency</span> base. Developer Clarion Partners signed up consulting firm <span class="companylink">Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corp</span>., which has significant defense contracting work, to take more than one-fourth of the 330,000-square-foot building in 2011. But late last year, midway through Booz Allen's build-out of its offices, it reversed course. The company began advertising the entire space for sublease, halting its construction. During a recent visit, one floor was completely bare, and another contained partially built offices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tauri Group, a defense contractor in the same building that has work ranging from chemical-weapons surveillance to infrastructure safety, has also been looking for tenants to sublease its space in the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Fisher, a spokesman for Booz Allen, said the decision to sublease at least a portion of the space came as more employees have been working from home or at clients' offices, and as the company has been looking to trim its real-estate footprint. A representative for Tauri declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, the Washington-area market is still considered healthy, particularly compared with many suburban areas outside New York and Chicago, where vacancies top 20%. In addition, federal spending is still expected to grow in the long term, and with it, jobs will likely follow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for now, the trajectory change is rippling through the region. In the Crystal City neighborhood of Arlington, Va., a cluster of office buildings just west of Reagan National Airport, vacancies have gradually risen over the past two years to nearly 30% in top buildings, largely as a result of efforts by the Department of Defense to consolidate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Murtazo Muhammad, manager of the Italian eatery Kora Restaurant, said lunch is about half as busy as it was two years ago, causing him to cut back on staff. "We used to dance around tables because they were so packed," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tax revenues from commercial properties in Fairfax County came in $33 million short of expectations this year, growing by just 0.1%, well less than the 6% expected. The county recently passed a property-tax increase that raises an estimated $20 million, or more than $200 a homeowner, and froze wages for many workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're used to growth," said John Cook, a member of the county's board of supervisors, adding the county has been stung both by cuts and uncertainty over future federal spending. "We couldn't give our employees pay raises, and we're not real happy about that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New office development -- and the accompanying construction work -- has also slowed.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in metropolitan areas saw their biggest year-over-year gains in more than seven years in the first quarter, evidence that the housing recovery is spreading across the nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Thursday that the national median closing price for an existing single-family house was $176,600 in the first quarter, up 11.3% from the first quarter of 2012. That was the largest year-over-year gain since the end of 2005. Of the 150 metro areas tracked by the NAR, sale prices rose in 133 and declined in 17.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The supply/demand balance is clearly tilted toward sellers," said NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest gain was in Akron, Ohio, where the median sale price rose 32.7% to $108,300. Following Akron, prices were up 32.6% in the San Francisco-Oakland-Fremont area; 32.1% in Reno-Sparks, Nev.; 31.7% in the Silicon Valley area surrounding San Jose; 31.1% in Atlanta; and 30.1% in Phoenix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices are still falling in Kankakee-Bradley, Ill., where they were down 18.8%. Prices declined 8.6% in Edison, N.J.; 8.3% in Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton, Pa.; 5.5% in Champaign-Urbana, Ill.; and 5.0% in Erie, Pa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR's quarterly report is a good measure of general price trends, but the results can sometimes overstate the magnitude of price gains because they don't control for shifts in the number of homes sold in various price categories. As a result, the median price can rise sharply if sales of higher-end homes increase faster than sales of lower-priced homes.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto and Eliot Brown </div><div>992 words</div><div>9 May 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A21</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Time Warner Inc</span>. is leaning toward moving its roughly 1 million-square-foot headquarters to a fledgling office district on Manhattan's far West Side, according to a person briefed on the company's plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Time Warner intends to make a decision in June, the person familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move to the Hudson Yards area by a major media company now located in a prestigious office tower near Central Park would boost the city's drive to transform an area now marked by rail yards and warehouses into a modern district of office and residential towers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Time Warner executives previously have said the move would help it consolidate employees from 15 buildings. It would also give the company the chance to freshen its image as a cutting-edge media and entertainment company that can compete for young employees with hip tech and media start-ups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Coach Inc</span>. helped spur the Hudson Yards' redevelopment in late 2011 by agreeing to take 600,000 square feet at a Related Cos. tower at 10th Avenue and West 30th Street. But that move was more modest than that contemplated by Time Warner, because Coach's headquarters were just a couple of blocks away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The next tenant is an important moment for the district because it starts to build real momentum with tenants from other parts of the city. Coach was already there. We also need tenants to have this willingness to relocate and spend money to move," said Derek Trulson, a broker at <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>, who represents <span class="companylink">Extell Development Co</span>. in leasing its site in the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Time Warner could choose one or multiple West Side locations, likely from sites owned by Extell, <span class="companylink">Brookfield Office Properties</span>, Joseph Moinian and Related Cos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company has toured these sites looking for about 1.3 million square feet, and company leaders and consultants have had multiple meetings with developers and brokers, according to people familiar with the matter. These people said the company had signaled it was narrowing the search to the West Side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Time Warner is also leaning toward selling its 1.1 million-square-foot Columbus Circle headquarters -- which is expected to fetch more than $1 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter. It expected to have a buyer by the end of May, the person said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is such a unique window of time" for a company like Time Warner to move its headquarters, said Doug Harmon of Eastdil Secured, who is marketing the tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He noted investors were paying top prices for top properties -- such as Time Warner's headquarters at Columbus Circle -- and Hudson Yards developers were "so hungry to fill sites with very good-name, large tenants."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Time Warner has been a candidate for moving west since it met more than two years ago with Related executives about their Hudson Yards development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, when the company officially started its search for a new home last year, it cast a much wider net. It approached the owners of about 20 local sites, including the World Trade Center and Brookfield's complex formerly known as the World Financial Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Time Warner has 6,500 full-time employees and occupies 4 million square feet in the New York area. It moved to Columbus Circle a decade ago -- when that area had a more dated atmosphere -- and anchored the development of the two-pronged tower overlooking Central Park. It also leases space for HBO at 1100 Sixth Ave. and 1271 Sixth Ave. for <span class="companylink">Time Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Time Warner would move most of the divisions in its Columbus Circle site to Hudson Yards, including executive offices and potentially CNN, according to people familiar with the matter. It would also move HBO.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It remains unclear whether it would move <span class="companylink">Time Inc</span>. Time Warner announced in March that it was spinning off the magazine division into a separate company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Time Warner makes the move to the Hudson Yards area, it would join not just Coach, but also the U.S. division of <span class="companylink">L'Oreal SA</span>, which agreed to move from Fifth Avenue, and SAP, a software company, as the first handful of tenants in the fledgling Hudson Yards development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The neighborhood was rezoned in 2005 to allow more than 40 million square feet of new office and apartment developments. The city has said it intended to spend $3 billion on infrastructure there, including new parks and the extension of the No. 7 subway line to 33rd Street and 11th Avenue, which is under construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While companies such as <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> and Conde Nast initially expressed interest in moving to the area, employers pulled back when the recession hit. Overall, the Manhattan leasing market remains sluggish, but the Hudson Yards project appears to be bucking the trend. A number of new hotels and apartment buildings are under construction, as well as the first office tower in Related's $15 billion development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The great advantage that we're now seeing of having started the south tower," said Jay Cross, who oversees Related's West Side development, "is that the yards in general -- the broader definition of the west side -- has gained a lot of momentum and that's good for everybody."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts said the project would continue to face challenges, as many of the city's growing companies are small, technology and media companies that can't afford space in large, new office towers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The one monkey wrench that has come up is that this question of whether the new media companies and media-tech companies of the world . . . want the same Park Avenue-esque corporate addresses," said Michael Meola, who worked on the project while at the city Economic Development Corp. and now works as a consultant.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Craig Karmin </div><div>848 words</div><div>8 May 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A glitzy Manhattan real-estate crowd gathered in March to join Barry Sternlicht, chief executive of Starwood Capital Group, at a party celebrating the launch of condo sales at the Baccarat Hotel &amp; Residences, a new development across from <span class="companylink">the Museum of Modern Art</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 50-story glass tower, expected to open in 2014 and feature a five-star hotel and Baccarat chandeliers in each condo, is the sort of development rarely seen in the years after the financial crisis. But riskier projects are starting to move forward again, thanks in part to a resurgence of so-called opportunity real-estate funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These private-equity funds invest in riskier real estate, such as half-empty office buildings, distressed properties weighed down with debt, or pricey new construction that must find well-heeled buyers to profit. The Baccarat, which is being developed by Starwood and Tribeca Associates for $400 million, is counting on selling condos for as much as $60 million each.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For most of the downturn, these real-estate funds struggled to raise money because their main source, big pension funds, were risk-averse and still licking their wounds from when these bets went wrong. The <span class="companylink">California Public Employees' Retirement System</span>, the largest U.S. public fund with $263 billion, lost nearly half the value of its real-estate portfolio between July 2008 and June 2009 -- more than $10 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But these days, many pension funds are reconsidering -- or trying for the first time -- riskier real estate in an effort to boost returns at a time of low interest rates. These funds project up annual returns as much as 20%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A pension fund has to "take more risk to get double-digit returns," says Bob Jacksha, chief investment officer of the New Mexico Educational Retirement Board. His $10 billion fund recently committed $50 million to Crow Holdings, which manages opportunity funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pension funds also have been emboldened by the steady rise of commercial-property values since 2009 and a winnowing of some of the worst-performing funds. The economy shows signs of stabilizing after a rough period, and borrowing for real estate is cheap with rates so low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Many prices have fallen quite a bit, so there's now a lot of opportunity," says Edward Schwartz, a principal at real-estate consultant ORG Portfolio Management. But some pension funds, he adds, "also have short memories."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent months, a public-employees fund in Texas, Kentucky's main public fund and an Oklahoma City police fund all have made commitments to opportunity funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such funds raised about $25 billion in 2012, nearly double the amount in 2009, according to research firm Preqin. Nearly half of pension funds and other large investors allocating to real estate expect to make commitments to opportunity funds in the next 12 months, Preqin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private-equity giants <span class="companylink">KKR &amp; Co</span>. and <span class="companylink">TPG Capital</span> also are in the early stages of raising their first real-estate funds, which will focus on riskier investments, say people familiar with the matter. Starwood last month closed a $4.2 billion fund, well ahead of its initial $2 billion to $3 billion target, say people familiar with the fund. <span class="companylink">Brookfield Asset Management</span> has raised about $2.8 billion for an opportunity fund that is targeting $3.5 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the downturn, many pension funds largely spurned risk and focused their real-estate investments on the safest, well-leased properties in the healthiest markets. But now they are straining to make these strategies work as high demand for these properties drives up prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calpers acknowledged last month that the shift it started in 2011 from risk and toward more-stable property investments is proving tougher than it expected. It is becoming "hard for Calpers managers to make [real-estate] investments in which they can reasonably expect to generate returns in excess of" liabilities, the pension's real-estate consultant wrote the Calpers board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some opportunity funds aim for gold with new projects, others try to profit by turning around troubled buildings. <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span>, which recently raised a record $13.3 billion opportunity fund, last month bought London's Adelphi Building for about GBP 265 million ($412 million). That is a 19% discount from what the building fetched in 2007, but with a tenant occupying half the building departing, <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> will have to find a replacement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pension-fund investors embracing opportunity funds say they know it isn't a risk-free bet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The biggest risk, of course, is the downturn in the economy," says Steven Snyder, chief investment officer for the Oklahoma City Police Pension &amp; Retirement System, who made two recent commitments to opportunity funds. "That could be a negative for our investment."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schwartz says he has put clients such as Texas Municipal Retirement System and state funds in Maine, Indiana and Kentucky in opportunity funds partly because these funds responded to investor complaints that went beyond poor performance.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Cassandra Sweet and Ryan Tracy </div><div>1027 words</div><div>7 May 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last July, federal investigators subpoenaed <span class="companylink">SolarCity Corp</span>., the largest installer of residential solar panels, as part of a probe into whether solar-power companies received excessive government grants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, <span class="companylink">SolarCity</span> is pushing back with a lawsuit that alleges the opposite: some of the taxpayer-funded grants it received weren't as big as originally promised.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The suit, filed quietly in February in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, comes as <span class="companylink">SolarCity</span> and other industry players are defending solar-friendly government policies, and it could undermine the industry's message that solar power will soon be viable without government help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The case is the latest salvo in the tiff over a federal grant program that has paid out about $4.1 billion to solar projects since the 2009 economic-stimulus law created it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even before the Treasury Department's inquiry into grant applications filed by <span class="companylink">SolarCity</span> and other installers, House Republicans had questioned the program's effectiveness in creating jobs. Congress declined to renew the grant program at the end of 2011, and only projects that were being planned by that date can receive grants today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government is looking into whether <span class="companylink">SolarCity</span> and other firms misrepresented the fair-market value of solar systems in order to boost the value of the grants they received. In its suit, <span class="companylink">SolarCity</span> says two of the company's subsidiaries received smaller-than-expected grants. The company doesn't say exactly how much funding it applied for originally, but it says the final grants issued by the Treasury Department were $8 million less than was proper under the law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company says it could lose millions of dollars more if the government does the same thing on all $400 million in grants it has sought.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If <span class="companylink">SolarCity</span>'s suit is successful, other participants in the grant program might be encouraged to file cases of their own or push for higher grants on what remains of pending applications, said Morten Lund, an attorney for Stoel Rives LLP in San Diego.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">SolarCity</span>, of San Mateo, Calif., installs solar panels on homes and businesses and sells shares in those systems to investors. The company, which went public in December, depends heavily on federal and state subsidies and government policies that support solar-power development. Among them are cash grants created by the federal stimulus law, which are based on the underlying value of the solar-power equipment and function like rebates for installers such as <span class="companylink">SolarCity</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The grant program has handed out more than $17 billion in stimulus money to solar and other renewable-power projects since 2010, according to Treasury records, and has been widely credited with driving fast growth in the U.S. solar-power market. That market has jumped from 440 megawatts of solar panels installed in 2009 to 3,300 megawatts in 2012, and it is expected to grow to 4,300 megawatts this year, according to a report by GTM Research and the <span class="companylink">Solar Energy Industries Association</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the solar market's fast growth, losses and bankruptcies involving manufacturers have made investors wary of betting on companies in the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">SolarCity</span> has been a rare exception; its stock has tripled from its $8 IPO price. It closed Monday down 2% at $26.43. The company isn't profitable, reporting a 2012 net loss of $91.6 million on revenue of $128.7 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">SolarCity</span> offers homeowners solar-panel installations, typically through a leasing program that involves an up-front payment followed by a preset number of monthly payments. The company pays for the initial cost of acquiring the system from the manufacturer and of installing it with help from funds provided by system investors like <span class="companylink">U.S. Bancorp</span> and <span class="companylink">Google Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The investors earn a return through the portion of monthly payments allocated to them. <span class="companylink">SolarCity</span> and the investors also earn a separate return from the government grants, which act like a rebate toward the cost of installing the systems. The investors enter into the deals expecting a certain level of government grant, and therefore a certain returnin this case, their portion of a grant they expected to be worth 30% of the value of the installed system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if the Treasury Department determines the system value is lower than what Solar City claims, the final grant will be lower than planned, and <span class="companylink">SolarCity</span> is on the hook to make up the shortfall to <span class="companylink">U.S. Bancorp</span> or other funders, according to its contracts, <span class="companylink">SolarCity</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its lawsuit, <span class="companylink">SolarCity</span> says it made such deals with the expectation of grant levels outlined in the stimulus law. It says the Treasury Department then adopted its own rules for determining grant amounts and later changed those rules after grant applications were filed, resulting in the company obtaining lower grants than it anticipated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, other <span class="companylink">SolarCity</span> subsidiaries later "were forced to apply for smaller grants than they were entitled" because of the new rules, the lawsuit says. The lawsuit alleges that Treasury exceeded its authority in changing the grant levels because Congress didn't give it that discretion. "They changed the rules in the middle of the game, and then they backdated the rules," <span class="companylink">SolarCity</span> Chief Executive Lyndon Rive said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Treasury Department declined to comment on the lawsuit. In the past, it has said it determines whether grant applicants are fairly valuing solar systems by looking at "typical market pricing," and other factors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least one other renewable-energy developer has sued over stimulus grants that were smaller than requested. LCM Energy Solutions, of Dallas, sued in U.S. Federal Claims Court in May 2012 seeking $500,000 in stimulus funds. In the case, which is still pending, the company accused the Treasury of undervaluing its projects and underpaying stimulus grants for 18 solar-panel systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Hayes, a lawyer for LCM, said it will soon be asking the court to increase several more grants it recently received. The Treasury Department declined to comment on the LCM suit.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jennifer Levitz </div><div>1656 words</div><div>7 May 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deep in the president's new budget is a plan that could transform public housing in the nation by allowing housing authorities to increasingly set time limits or work requirements for participants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, government housing benefits are generally open ended. Unlike welfare -- which has a five-year limit -- federal housing programs allow low-income Americans to receive rent vouchers or live in government complexes for decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result is that people endure long waits to qualify for the program and sometimes celebrate almost like lottery winners when they get the word. In New York City, the average person stays in public housing for 20.7 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But President Barack Obama's fiscal year 2014 budget calls for "substantial expansion" of a 1996 demonstration project that allows select housing authorities to set restrictions on residents, or try other strategies to promote self-sufficiency. Only 39 housing authorities out of 3,200 nationally have this power currently. Congressional approval was required for each one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing agencies are lobbying for the expansion. They say the current system doesn't motivate residents to become financially independent and isn't fair to thousands of impoverished renters who need help now but must wait years for assistance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Directors of both the Houston and Milwaukee housing authorities say they would likely add work requirements for people getting public assistance there. Tenants with jobs would pay a higher share of the rent, and the housing authorities would be able to help more people, they say. The Houston Housing Authority drew 83,000 applicants for vouchers when it opened its waiting list in August, versus 29,000 when it last opened the list in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've got these waiting lists that in some cases you practically get through a generation before you get a shot at a unit," says Tony Perez, executive director of the Housing Authority of the City of Milwaukee. "If you want to change this, you have to change the way you go about business."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress appropriated $34.3 billion in 2013 for public housing, including vouchers. Eligible households for the vouchers earn at or below 50% of median area income, and generally pay 30% of gross adjusted income toward rent and utilities while the government pays the rest, within a range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the program, a family of two earning $15,000 a year in California's San Bernardino County would pay $375 a month toward its rent. The Housing Authority of the County of San Bernardino chips in up to another $1,025 a month, depending on the cost and location of the apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recession and mortgage crisis swelled the ranks seeking federal rental assistance and led those with benefits to hold on to them longer. Well-publicized instances of fights and mayhem broke out in January near Detroit and New Orleans as people scrambled for scarce vouchers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While there is agreement the current system is broken, not everyone approves of President Obama's fix. The National Low Income Housing Coalition, an advocacy group, said the change would force people off housing assistance before they are ready.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You are just cycling these families back to the end of these waiting lists," says Linda Couch of the coalition. "The answer is more affordable housing; it's not moving the deck chairs on the Titanic."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government began providing public housing in 1937, initially building publicly managed apartment complexes for the poor. In 1974, Congress added "Section 8" vouchers that recipients could use to subsidize private rental housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1996, the U.S. overhauled its welfare system that provided cash to families. Now, participants in the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families program are required to work, and they receive benefits for no more than five years. At the same time, Congress created a small demonstration project, "Moving to Work," for public housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some authorities participating in the project have recently imposed time limits and other restrictions on renters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Tacoma, Wash., the housing authority in March started limiting new recipients to five-year terms. San Mateo, Calif., San Antonio and the <span class="companylink">Alaska Housing Finance Corporation</span> plan their own versions of time limits within the next year. The restrictions are applying most commonly to rent vouchers, but also in some cases to public housing. The disabled and elderly are exempt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We provide these very valuable housing vouchers -- deep, potentially permanent subsidies -- to a group of very fortunate families and then we have thousands of people with their noses pressed up against the window desperately needing housing and getting nothing from us," "says Michael Mirra, executive director of the Tacoma Housing Authority. As of March, the average length of stay for nondisabled, nonelderly voucher recipients at the housing authority was nearly eight years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other housing authorities are instituting rules requiring residents to get a job. The Housing Authority of Champaign County, Ill. in January began mandating that new residents between ages 18 and 54 must work 20 hours per week. For existing residents, the mandate is being phased in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Some people need a real push,' said Patty Smith, an official at the Champaign County authority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many who work with low-income families say that current housing policies provide little incentive to move on. Ideally, the government should tell residents, "Your housing is stable. Congrats, take a deep breath. What's next?" says Sherry Riva, founder of Compass Working Capital, a Massachusetts nonprofit working with the Cambridge Housing Authority to help residents save money and set goals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recession has complicated things. Those with subsidies held on to them longer, while new people entered the rental market after the foreclosure crisis, says Sandra Henriquez, an assistant secretary at the <span class="companylink">U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal rental assistance aims to "move people to economic independence, so you move in, you move up, you move out," she says. But even leading into the recession, people kept housing benefits for an average of six or seven years, she says, and "In the last five years, we see a little bit of a creep that is moving that up to eight and nine years."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While roughly half of subsidized-housing recipients are seniors or disabled, who are exempt from new time limits, younger, healthier people also stay for years. The <span class="companylink">Center on Budget and Policy Priorities</span>, a nonpartisan group focused on low-income families, found that in 2010, 43% of nondisabled, nonelderly voucher holders had been getting the benefits for more than five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, HUD reported in February that a record 8.5 million low-income households without government housing assistance either paid more than half their monthly income in rent, lived in "severely substandard housing" -- or both in 2011. That was up from 7.1 million such families in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Nobody is representing those families; they don't really have an organization looking out for them," says Dan Nackerman, executive director of San Bernardino's housing authority, which adopted five-year-time limits last year after finding that people were holding on to vouchers for eight years on average, while 45,000 people sat on the waiting list.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The president's proposal to expand moving-to-work has bipartisan support in Congress, although there is disagreement over how big the expansion should be. Some Republicans support unlimited growth in the program for high-performing housing authorities, while many Democrats back a more limited expansion. In either case, federal officials would monitor the program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">House Committee on Financial Services</span> plans to take up the proposed expansion soon, says the spokeswoman for chairman Jeb Hensarling, (R., Texas). The Senate Committee on Banking Affairs will also consider the idea, says the spokesman for chairman Robert Menendez (D., N.J.).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tacoma, a hilly port city south of Seattle, imposed a five-year limit on benefits in March. In exchange, the housing authorities say it is preparing people for the private rental market. It is enlisting case workers to help residents repair credit records and go back to school, and forming partnerships with nonprofits that offer job training and child-care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The authority will consider hardship requests to make sure the new approach isn't harming residents, says authority director Michael Mirra. He predicts the deadline will motivate recipients to invest in their own education and employment, while providing a fair system to people like Elizabeth Hadnot, who applied in 2008 and only got her voucher in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Divorced with two of her five children at home, and with custody of her toddler granddaughter, "it's been a struggle," said Ms. Hadnot during a break at BJ's Beauty &amp; Barber College, where she is in school. "I held on to my faith."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with two jobs -- at a gas station and youth center -- she still spent 75% of her wages on rent, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She obtained a federal grant for needy students and enrolled in the beauty school last year, while a church friend offered Ms. Hadnot's family a temporary place to stay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Ms. Hadnot kept "popping in" to the housing authority to see if her name had moved up, she said. "I was adamant about getting into the program so I could move forward in life."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The five-year time limit on her new voucher "is a little scary" and at first prompted disappointment because "I know people who have been in public housing forever," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now at 45 years old, she thinks that is "a good amount of time" to carry out a "plan of action." She listed her goals, such as her own home and her own salon. "It is really happening, it's my turn," she said. "Five years started ticking yesterday."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Heather Haddon </div><div>994 words</div><div>7 May 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A21</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When in 2011 the <span class="companylink">U.S. Army</span> closed Fort Monmouth -- a New Jersey base where researchers developed the walkie-talkie and bounced the first radar signals off the moon -- the decision left a gaping hole in Monmouth County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Work began last year to transform the decommissioned fort into a technological and housing hub, and the impact of superstorm Sandy prompted officials to speed up part of the development. In the process, the storm also reignited a debate about whether the housing to be constructed on one of the state's largest buildable parcels is sufficient or even well-conceived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local officials say their towns need commercial development more than housing because the fort's closure has hurt their economies. But housing-advocacy groups say Sandy highlighted the need for new homes near the battered Jersey Shore, and that even more should be built at Fort Monmouth than already planned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's basically a clean slate," said Phil Welch, co-chairman of the Monmouth Advocacy Team, a coalition of groups that has petitioned for more housing at the fort for years. "Yes, we need jobs, but we also need housing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, the fort has already played a role in housing some of those displaced by the Oct. 29 storm. The <span class="companylink">Federal Emergency Management Agency</span> oversaw the rehabilitation of 115 units on the property, and families moved there in January. They will be able to stay free of charge in the homes until around May 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fort Monmouth, established in 1917, bears similarities to Governors Island in New York Harbor, another former military reservation undergoing a transformation. Both feature historic brick houses where officers once made their homes, along with barracks where soldiers stayed. Each has large stretches of open land, and neither is seriously contaminated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fort Monmouth, however, is nearly 10 times the size of Governors Island, with 1,127 acres spread across the towns of Eatontown, Oceanport and Tinton Falls. The fort was built as a complete city, with churches, a bowling alley, marina, 18-hole golf course, swimming pools and a 900-seat theater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's intended to be a tremendous asset to New Jersey," said David Nuse, director of real-estate development for the state Fort Monmouth Economic Revitalization Authority during a tour of the fort last Monday. "Opportunities like this come around once in a generation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the fort's peak during World War II, an estimated 35,000 soldiers worked and trained there. The base was home to the Eastern Signal Corps schools and the Pigeon Breeding and Training Center, and was a center of communications research for decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There were just incredible developments coming out of there that changed not just the course of the military, but world communications," said Melissa Ziobro, a former fort historian who now teaches at <span class="companylink">Monmouth University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2005, the Pentagon recommended closing Fort Monmouth as part of a nationwide military consolidation. The Department of Defense estimated the closure would save the military $154 million, but also result in the loss of 10,300 base and associated jobs -- nearly 1% of the area's employment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The whole area has been devastated economically," said Eatontown Mayor Gerald Tarantolo, who has witnessed businesses close and his population drop since the base closed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under a plan adopted by the state in 2008, 1,600 units of housing will be built on the fort property -- including at least 474 apartments -- along with retail and commercial space. The authority hopes to focus the commercial development on technology and research companies, and the CommVault software firm agreed to pay $6 million to build its headquarters on 55 acres at the fort last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've turned up the activity level substantially," said Mr. Nuse while construction crews drove pilings for the 650,000-square-foot building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The authority would like to attract a high-tech university in a more "low-key" version of the city's competition to bring a college to Roosevelt Island, Mr. Nuse said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While local officials favor the commercial development, they are more cautious about the housing. Most town leaders oppose dense apartments, and an influx of children that could crowd schools in the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You can't put apartment buildings there. That's not our kind of community," said Joseph Irace, an Oceanport councilman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 45% of the fort is intended to remain open space, and housing advocates say that some of that land could be used to build more apartments for those displaced by Sandy. Tens of thousands of people haven't returned home from the storm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's absolutely a lost opportunity in a state that is as densely developed as New Jersey," said Kevin Walsh, associate director for the Fair Share Housing Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nuse said there could be some flexibility in how the fort was developed. An industrial building set to be razed, for example, might instead be converted into a rock-climbing gym.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the amount of housing that can be built on the fort is capped, he said. The authority helped to respond to the area's housing needs after Sandy by putting out to bid renovations to 117 historic homes earlier than anticipated. The three- to five-bedroom homes will be developed as condos and single-family homes by the spring of 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another 275-unit development in Eatontown was also sped up, and three additional proposals for 590 units were put out to bid last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state hopes to have the fort fully redeveloped by 2022. The <span class="companylink">U.S. Army</span> doesn't have oversight of how individual bases are developed once closed, but generally supports what New Jersey has proposed, said Dave Foster, an Army spokesman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The authority "appears to have a viable, balanced, well managed plan for reuse of Fort Monmouth," Mr. Foster said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Benn Steil and Dinah Walker   </div><div>811 words</div><div>6 May 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>15</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2003, then U.S. Federal Reserve Governor Ben Bernanke urged the Japanese government to protect the <span class="companylink">Bank of Japan</span> from capital losses on its massive holdings of domestic government bonds. In a speech to the Japan Society of Monetary Economics in Tokyo, he argued that "heated and unproductive debate" over the impact of capital losses on the BoJ's balance sheet would interfere with the rational conduct of monetary policy. Japan's central bank, he said, was insufficiently aggressive in its response to deflation because it had one eye wrongly trained on an accounting issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fast forward 10 years, and the Fed is in a comparable position. The minutes of the January Federal Open Market Committee meeting revealed concern that the "risks of asset purchases" might cause the Fed to "taper or end its purchases" before "improvement in the outlook for the labor market had occurred." In other words, the concern of some members of the FOMC over potential losses on the Fed's massive holdings of mortgage-backed securities was affecting the central bank's thinking about monetary policy. That's what Mr. Bernanke had warned Japan not to let happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bernanke had urged the BoJ and the <span class="companylink">Japanese Ministry of Finance</span> to enter into an interest-rate swap that would move the risk of capital losses off the central bank's balance sheet. We believe the Fed needs a similar swap with the <span class="companylink">U.S. Treasury</span> today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed currently holds $1.1 trillion in mortgage-backed securities. Given Wednesday's FOMC announcement that it would continue purchasing these securities at a pace of $40 billion a month, the bank is on track to increase its MBS holdings to $1.5 trillion by the end of the year -- around 27% of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FOMC has already expressed a desire to reduce such holdings as a means of normalizing the size and composition of its balance sheet (typically comprised overwhelmingly of short-term Treasury securities) when the time comes to bring to an end its policy of maintaining near-zero short-term interest rates. The problem: Selling MBS into the shallow market for these securities could drive down their prices, drive up mortgage rates, and depress house and real estate prices. Such a development might not only derail the economic recovery but trigger intervention from policy makers reacting to angry constituents. Rising interest rates also threaten large capital losses on the Fed's portfolio of these securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chairman Bernanke is well aware of these risks. He has emphasized that the Fed has other tools for tightening monetary policy besides asset sales. These include term deposit auctions (term deposits are like certificates of deposit, or CDs) to entice banks to lock up their funds with the Fed for a fixed period. Yet the Fed is unlikely to be willing to allow rates to rise as far and as fast as the market may demand in a term deposit auction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> -- which has carried out many such auctions since 2010 -- places caps on the rates it pays. As a result, seven of its auctions have failed, meaning that the ECB failed to withdraw euros from the market despite its public pledges to do so. The Fed will lose credibility at a crucial time if it says that it will drain liquidity from the financial system but fails.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Therefore, a conventional approach to monetary tightening -- selling securities from the Fed's bloated balance sheet -- is the sounder choice, at least provided that it is not forced to sell illiquid, sector-specific securities like MBS. To accomplish this, the Fed should sell its MBS portfolio to Treasury at face value in exchange for an equivalent amount of Treasury securities issued for the purpose of facilitating the swap. There is precedent for this: The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 gave Treasury the authority to purchase MBS guaranteed by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. Our plan is logically identical to the one that Mr. Bernanke urged on Japan 10 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Concern may still be raised that Treasury would be aiding the Fed in escaping responsibility for managing the necessary aftermath of its extraordinary market interventions. If financial risks can be dumped onto another government body, they may be insufficiently accounted for when the Fed acts. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act offers a template for future crisis interventions that addresses this concern -- a template in which only Treasury, and not the Fed, intervenes in markets for securities other than those that Treasury itself issues.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sanette Tanaka   </div><div>457 words</div><div>3 May 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Call it the flora-and-fauna effect: Home buyers will pay a premium to live near open, undeveloped land. So much for good neighbors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's the conclusion of a Colorado State University study of home prices in conservation developments, where residential real estate is limited and a substantial amount of land, usually 50% to 70%, is set aside as open space. "That could mean wildlife habitats, agricultural lands, important cultural sites, open space for scenic vistas," says Sarah Reed, co-author of the study and associate conservation scientist with the <span class="companylink">Wildlife Conservation Society</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researchers compared 2,222 home sales in five counties in Colorado between 1998 to 2011. The conservation developments set aside an average 64% of land as open space, while traditional rural subdivisions set aside 4.9%. Based on the analysis, homes in conservation developments sold for 29% more than homes located in conventional residential projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For a homeowner, this means that the value of their home will be greater just by being in a development with open space," Prof. Reed says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Increasing lot size in an undesignated conservation development raised the market price by 38 cents per square foot or $16,662 per acre, researchers found. In nonconservation developments, a bigger lot size translated to only 9 cents per square foot, or $4,062 per acre. The study, funded by the National Association of Realtors and CSU's School of Global Environmental Sustainability, was published in December 2012 in the Journal of Sustainable Real Estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 2011 study in the journal Conservation Biology estimates that roughly 310,000 acres have been developed in the U.S. as conservation subdivisions, where anywhere from 30% to 70% of land is protected as open space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More subdivisions probably qualify, but developers haven't sought designation by the county as official conservation developments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regardless, the price perk is still there: Homes in undesignated conservation developments sell for 25% more than those in conventional subdivisions, the Colorado State researchers found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Open-space living often appeals to active, outdoorsy buyers -- "tree-huggers," says Rosanne Sledz, a real-estate agent with Weichert Realtors McKee Real Estate. One of the premier conservation developments, Prairie Crossing in Grayslake, Ill., about an hour north of Chicago, designates more than 60% of its 677-acre site as protected open space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You can walk out your back door and start jogging on a trail that takes you through miles and miles of forest preserves," Ms. Sledz says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roderick Chapman, a 50-year-old marketing specialist from Vancouver, British Columbia, was in Buenos Aires last month, looking at one-bedrooms in the city's posh Recoleta district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm absolutely amazed by the number of choices," said Mr. Chapman whose budget for a vacation property is 130,000 U.S. dollars the currency in which most Buenos Aires real estate typically is traded. "It is overwhelming, really."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With prices for luxury apartments down by 20% to 25% since last year, according to local real-estate agents, expatriates like Mr. Chapman are finding great buys in Buenos Aires after nearly a decade of steep price climbs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nicely renovated apartments with parquet floors and terraces in Recoleta the neighborhood that gave Buenos Aires the moniker "the Paris of South America" are selling for roughly $185 per square foot, down from roughly $240 in 2008, according to local agent estimates (closing prices aren't published in Buenos Aires). One-bedrooms in trendy Palermo list for about $150,000 and sell for less. Local brokers offer listings for $200,000 to $400,000 that they say might have sold for 40% more two years ago. Some multimillion-dollar properties are being marketed for nearly half of what was asked just a few years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is a catch to the new Buenos Aires buyers market, as Mr. Chapman's house-hunting trip illustrates. "I actually have to cut my trip short, because I've run out of dollars and I can't get any more," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Mr. Chapman, as for other foreign home shoppers in Buenos Aires, navigating Argentina's complicated currency landscape is the wrench in the otherwise tempting real-estate works.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May last year, Argentine President Christina Kirchner strictly limited access to U.S. dollars and other foreign currencies in a bid to stem capital flight. With the Argentine peso facing about 25% annual inflation (government figures, widely discredited, set the rate much lower), and an unofficial exchange rate that has effectively devalued the peso sharply, demand is high for dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, the main feature that foreign buyers say they look for in a Buenos Aires property has nothing to do with closet space or a wide terrace. It is a seller with a bank account outside Argentina to which they can legally wire funds. This is a way to get around having to convert any dollars wired into Argentina into pesos at the official rate, after which it is nearly impossible to convert back into dollars at the official rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Chapman has asked brokers to show him only apartments owned by sellers willing to do a foreign-account-to-foreign-account sale. "I absolutely, absolutely, absolutely will not bring my money into Argentina," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The currency situation has spooked some foreigners living in the country. Real-estate agent Pericles Economides said foreign homeowners make up 90% of the sellers in his listings, while local buyers eager to convert their devaluing pesos into more stable real estate make up nearly all his current buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, in such a climate, foreign buyers find that their dollars in cash, as mortgages are rare in Argentina give them market clout. Buenos Aires property developer Gabriel Maioli, a partner at M&amp;M Developers in Buenos Aires, began selling newly built apartments in pesos for the first time last year but offers discounts to buyers willing to pay in dollars, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among luxury apartments currently on the market is the 9,200-square-foot 14th floor of the Art Deco Kavanagh Building, offering sweeping views of the city's central Plaza San Martin and, on a clear day, neighboring Uruguay across the River Plate. Two of the bedrooms open onto terrace gardens so large their lawns require mowing. The owner, real-estate mogul Alain Levenfiche, put the property on the market in 2008 for $5.9 million but failed to sell it. Today, he is asking $3.3 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Palermo Botanico, considered to be one of the city's premier neighborhoods, a five-bedroom apartment with a bird's-eye view from a large deck of the city zoo's llamas, guanacos and condors is on the market for $695,000. American owners Douglas and Janet Choi, both 43, who moved to the city in 2008 for a "personal-growth opportunity" and are now planning a move to London, said they spent $200,000 on renovations that included a modern, granite-topped kitchen and a wood-burning grill on the terrace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some local agents have called the Chois "dreamers" because of the property's price tag, estimating that $500,000 is a more likely selling price. Mr. Choi said the family doesn't have "the need to sell such a special place," and will rent if they can't find a buyer before their move to London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alan Dickinson, a 50-year-old technology sales executive in New York, is looking to buy his second property in the city. "In what other world-class city can you buy property of this caliber at those prices?" said Mr. Dickinson, who raves about the city's pasta, steak, and "really friendly, inclusive" people. Last month, he met with several Buenos Aires real-estate brokers, instructing them to alert him to distressed sellers looking for a quick, dollar-denominated sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2005, he paid $185,000 for a newly built Palermo duplex with a terrace, finally taking possession in 2009 after construction delays. He lives in it for a week out of every two months and rents it out to tourists the rest of the time. In four years, he has grossed more than what he spent on the unit, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with the new restrictions on U.S. dollars and other foreign currencies, many deals are falling apart at the 11th hour due to the difficulty in arranging payment, said Michael Koh, a real-estate investor and consultant who has made more than 500 real-estate transactions in Buenos Aires on behalf of clients. Negotiating sales, he said, has become "crazy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, two sales Mr. Koh was negotiating on behalf of foreign sellers stalled when one Argentine buyer wanted to pay with gold bars and another offered a studio apartment as partial payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hurdles haven't stopped him from investing. Mr. Koh owned eight properties in the city before closing last week on a ninth apartment. He bought a 500-square-foot, sleekly furnished one-bedroom with a balcony in Palermo Hollywood for $130,000, which he intends to rent short-term to tourists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I swore I would never buy anything there again," he said, "but there are now some deals that are too good to pass up."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Maudsley, a San Diego-based real-estate investor, also is undaunted. He arrived in the city in mid-April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Maudsley, 57, spent a week meeting with brokers and viewing apartments in Recoleta and Palermo, a hip, bohemian neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he isn't pulling the trigger quite yet. He met with financial and legal advisers who can help him quickly close a deal if he spies a bargain. He said Argentina's property market appeals to him because "it is a cash market," less likely to be affected by rising and falling interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The peso aspect is a real risk, but I'm banking on the fact that things will normalize down there," said Mr. Dickinson, the technology sales executive. "I think the country will get its act together."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Cecilie Rohwedder </div><div>1815 words</div><div>3 May 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David and Martha Gurzick bought their new home for its historic neighborhood and closeness to the cafes and antique stores of downtown Frederick, Md.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now they are also warming to the utility bills. The Gurzicks live in a so-called net-zero energy house -- a home so energy-efficient that over the course of a year, its electricity consumption is expected to be zero.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four-bedroom brick house includes energy-eating creature comforts, such as a steam room and an extra-large washer and dryer. But when the sun shines on the solar panels and the Gurzicks are at work, the house produces more energy than it consumes. At those times, the electricity meter is running backward, and the couple is selling energy back to the grid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Gurzicks, who paid $516,000 for the 2,800-square-foot home, moved in last December. "It was never our intention to get a green home, but these features are the icing on the cake," said Mr. Gurzick, who is 35 and teaches management at Hood College.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Extreme energy efficiency is moving mainstream, becoming standard practice for large home builders, such as California-based <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> and <span class="companylink">Nexus Energy</span> Homes, the company that built the Gurzicks' house last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The "green" residential construction market has grown steadily in recent years -- even throughout the recession. Green housing projects accounted for 20% of all newly built homes last year and had an overall value of $25 billion, according to industry-research firm McGraw Hill Construction. As the housing market continues to recover, the researchers predict, this share will grow to between 29% and 38% of new U.S. homes by 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The green building market has evolved beyond the crunchy-granola, Boulder types," said David Johnston, a Colorado consultant and co-author of "Toward a Zero Energy Home." "We have mainstream builders doing this."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, net-zero houses are only a fraction of the green residential movement, but other environmental features are becoming widespread. The government is fueling the trend with federal tax credits for things like insulation that reduces a home's energy loss or geothermal heat pumps. Depending on where they live, homeowners can also claim rebates from their state, town or utility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Materials and construction costs for clean-energy homes can jack up the price of a new home, but these costs have been dropping. On average, green homes cost between 5% and 10% more than conventional houses, according to Bruce W. McIntosh, chief operating officer of Nexus Energy Homes. In Washington, D.C., architect Robert Bell is building a five-bedroom, net-zero (also called energy-neutral) house that costs only 2% more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such houses get built even in extreme climates. Bill Henry, owner of a custom home-building company, designed his own net-zero family residence in Hereford, Ariz. Like all uber-efficient homes, it is constructed to lose as little energy as possible while adding renewable energy through solar panels. Mr. Henry and his wife, Patty, spent $450,000 to build their 2,300-square-foot home, about $25,000 of which went toward the environmental features. The extra cost, the Henrys calculate, will be offset in the long term by lower utility bills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the family's old house, monthly electricity bills were at least $300. Now, they have not exceeded $25 -- even with Mr. Henry's home office and four television-watching, iPad-using kids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With tightly insulated walls to prevent air escaping, a thick foundation and triple-pane windows, the Henrys' four-bedroom property meets one of the strictest environmental building standards in the U.S. The designation, called Passive House, focuses on airtight building, combined with a ventilation system that brings in fresh air without losing heat in the winter or coolness in the summer. Houses built this way need 90% less heating and cooling than normal ones, according to the Passive House Institute US, an Urbana, Ill.-based consulting group that advises home builders on efficiency standards and certifies homes that meet them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you make your house as energy-efficient as possible, you don't need a lot of solar after that," said Mr. Henry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite their home's 4,500-foot elevation, the Henrys didn't need heating this winter. Last summer, when temperatures climbed to the low 100s, they used a small air-conditioning unit -- but offset much of its energy use with the solar panels soaking up the Arizona sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sun also provides much of the heat for Gary Konkol's house in chilly Hudson, Wis. Over the winter, special triple-pane windows that capture 64% of the sun's warmth keep the house cozy even on 5-degree days -- so cozy that Mr. Konkol had lush indoor herbs, blooming orchids and a lemon tree. Regular window glass deflects the majority of this heat. Mr. Konkol's windows sit in tightly insulated frames and cost between 5% and 15% more than conventional, locally available triple-pane windows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It took a little while for the client to be comfortable with the idea that the heating system would be minute and the sun would provide 60% of the energy," said Tim Delhey Eian, the Minneapolis architect who designed the house. In the end, the house didn't even get a furnace. In-floor electric heat mats provide backup heating when there is not enough sunshine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One feature Mr. Konkol couldn't have: an open fireplace, because the chimney would require a hole in the thermally sealed house. The cube-shaped, two-story building is so airtight that Mr. Konkol, a 55-year-old family physician who bikes 16 miles every day to his practice, knows it is windy outside only from seeing trees moving through the window. Since he moved into the three-bedroom house in October 2010, it has produced 1,400 kilowatts of energy more than it consumes every year. Mr. Konkol wouldn't say what he paid for the 1,940-square-foot house but said the price was comparable to other custom homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main reason for the growing demand for low-energy houses, home builders say, is a desire to save on utility bills. Another is an effort to reduce uncertainty around future energy costs, and to gain independence from the power grid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The majority of our clients are at or nearing retirement," said Kevin Murphy, construction manager at Anchorage Building Corp. in North Carolina, which specializes in green and passive houses. "One thing they can do is to take the volatility of energy prices out of their fixed income by reducing the amount of electricity they use."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some houses make their owners more climate-conscious. Frederick residents Geordie Wilson and Pilar Olivo, who moved into a net-zero house near the Gurzicks with their three kids in September, say closely watching their energy use has made them more cautious consumers. Like all net-zero buildings, the Wilson-Olivo house is tightly insulated. To ensure good air quality inside, it has both an air-exchange system and a geothermal system that have filtration. The geothermal system heats and cools using piping that goes deep within the earth, where temperatures are warmer than outside air in the winter and cooler in the summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their green living has had its challenges. It took weeks to set a comfortable temperature in the house; early on, Ms. Olivo was doing jumping jacks in the living room to keep warm. Also, specialty filters for the geothermal system are not available locally and have to be purchased over the Internet. And Ms. Olivo struggled to understand the electricity bills until she realized that provider Potomac Edison was mischarging the family by adding, rather than crediting to the bill, the energy produced by their solar panels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is a lot of education for home buyers with a home like this," said Ms. Oliva, a 46-year-old homemaker. She and Mr. Wilson, who publishes the local newspaper, are proud of their house's energy performance and hope that it adds to its long-term value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Solar panels have limitations. They require steady sunlight and generally don't work in power outages. Depending how visible they are on a home's roof, the panels can hurt its curb appeal. They also won't offset unlimited energy use. "If you have a sleepover and 15 girls with hairdryers, you're not going to have a net-zero home," said <span class="companylink">Nexus Energy</span> Homes' Mr. McIntosh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, research suggests that green homes pay off when it comes time to sell. A 2012 study by two professors at the University of California, Berkeley and the University of California, Los Angeles found that homes in California with a green label sell for about 9% more than a comparable, less ecological house. Green certification is awarded by a number of programs, including LEED for Homes, Energy Star and NAHB Green. To get a LEED certification, for instance, homes collect points for green features, such as energy-efficient light bulbs and water-saving toilets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When homeowner Ian Kline recently put his home in Bethesda, Md., on the market, the glossy sales brochure noted that house is certified by both Passive House and Energy Star. It also contained four extra pages on its energy efficiency. Mr. Kline originally listed the residence for $1.59 million, but dropped the price to $1.49 million after a month. It is currently under contract. Mr. Kline bought the 4,660-square-foot house in October 2011 for $1.43 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Washington, D.C., area, environmentally friendly features are less of a selling point than in markets such as Berkeley, Calif., or Boulder, Colo., said Mr. Kline's selling agent, Erich Cabe at Coldwell Banker. Still, he estimates that 40% of those who looked at the house had some knowledge of green homebuilding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kline, who heads a consultancy focused on energy and the environment, said he would have "stayed in the house forever," but is moving out of town to gain space for a set of twins he and his wife are expecting, adding to a son and an existing set of twins. The couple will miss the home's low utility bills, high air quality and the quiet created by the thick walls -- as well as the green cred with their children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It has been awesome for the kids to be in this house," said Mr. Kline. "Our son is interested in the environment. He thinks his dad is cool -- most of the time."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve's policy-making committee was widely expected to vote to continue buying $85 billion in <span class="companylink">U.S. Treasury</span> debt and mortgage-backed securities each month as it met Wednesday, a day after strong housing data showed U.S. home prices rose at the fastest rate in seven years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some communities saw double-digit gains, as buyers are returning to a market where the number of properties for sale is in short supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central bank has said it will keep the bond-buying program in place until the labor market outlook "has improved substantially."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve, whose policies have kept mortgage rates low, has a lot riding on the housing rebound. The encouraging housing data came as other aspects of the recovery disappoint: Hiring remains patchy and the unemployment rate, at 7.6% in March, is more than 2 1/2 percentage points above where it was when the recession started in late 2007. Consumer-spending data this week, while solid, pointed to some second-half headwinds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices increased 9.3% in February from a year earlier while mortgage-interest rates hovered near record lows, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller index that tracks home prices in 20 major metropolitan areas. All 20 cities posted year-over-year gains for the second consecutive month, which hasn't happened since 2005, before the crash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some of the hardest-hit markets, the gains have been particularly heady. Home prices rose 23% from one year ago in Phoenix and 18.9% in San Francisco. Nationally, the median home price in March stood at $184,300, well below the peak of $230,400 in 2006 but up from $154,600 in January 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Nobody that I'm aware of anticipated the kind of price growth that we've had," said Budge Huskey, chief executive of <span class="companylink">Coldwell Banker Real Estate LLC</span>. "It's simple supply and demand."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real-estate market's brisk rebound raises concerns among some observers that traditional buyers, facing still-stringent mortgage-lending standards, are being squeezed out because investors are able to make winning bids by offering to pay in cash. Others are concerned that the pace of recent price gains isn't sustainable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, recent data suggest home-price gains are likely to continue. Sales of previously owned homes rose by 10.3% from one year ago in March, even as supplies of homes for sale fell by 16.8%. The Wall Street Journal's quarterly survey of market conditions in 28 metropolitan areas showed very low supplies of homes available in a rising number of markets, including a less-than-three-month supply in a dozen markets, including the two hottest -- Phoenix and San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supplies have dwindled as banks have pushed fewer homes through foreclosure and many homeowners are either unable or unwilling to sell due to factors related to the housing-crash hangover. Meanwhile, demand has picked up as the economy has added jobs, which has boosted household formation. Rising rents and falling mortgage rates have made ownership more attractive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing rebound is also closely tied to the Fed's campaign to lower interest rates, which has sped along the recovery in two key ways. First, by reducing yields on a range of assets, the Fed has made housing a more attractive investment. Investors of all sizes have been buying homes, often with cash, and converting them into rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, prices are rising even as the homeownership rate fell during the first quarter to 65%, reaching its lowest level since 1995, according to a separate report Tuesday by the Census Bureau. The report showed that relative to 2004, there were 7.2 million more renters but just 400,000 new homeowners, according to Capital Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower mortgage rates spurred by the Fed have also created urgency for traditional buyers, and they have made buyers who take out mortgages more immune to recent price increases. Even with the gains in home prices, housing is more affordable than at any time in the past 30 years because mortgage rates are so low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At current mortgage rates near 3.5%, home values would need to rise by 32% nationally -- and by as much as 48% in markets across the Midwest and north Florida -- for affordability to return to its long-run average, according to an analysis by John Burns Real Estate Consulting in Irvine, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the speed of recent price gains has raised concerns that prices could be going up too fast relative to incomes. "There is enough improvement in the underlying fundamentals to suggest that the housing recovery is well on its way. The only question that somebody could legitimately ask is, 'Is the pace sustainable?' " Mr. Huskey said. "You cannot suggest that we could sustain double-digit gains year after year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Normally, he said, prices should rise by 3% to 4%, outpacing inflation modestly. No one should be "buying a home because they think the 23% increase in Phoenix is going to be repeated two or three years in a row," Mr. Huskey said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say that, for now, home prices in most parts of the country remain in line or below their long-run relationship with incomes and rents. Also, many parts of the country that are seeing the strongest price increases witnessed some of the largest declines. In those markets, "there is room for prices to rise relative to incomes because they are at such a low base," said Frank Nothaft, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The concern is that home prices could more easily rise above their traditional relationship to incomes because lower mortgage rates will enable buyers to swallow price increases. "We are encouraging people to buy an asset that, when [mortgage] rates go back to 6% to 8%, will look a bit overpriced," said Stan Humphries, chief economist at Zillow, the real-estate website.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Key gauges of the factory sector and labor market showed further deceleration in April, reinforcing fears about another spring economic slowdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management said Wednesday its measure of U.S. manufacturing fell to 50.7 from 51.3 in March, putting it slightly above the dividing line between expansion and contraction. The survey of purchasing managers found that raw-materials prices and factory employment stagnated. But new orders and production both picked up steam, offering some hope for the coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's definitely a soft spot" for the sector, said Bradley Holcomb, chair of the ISM's manufacturing survey committee. But the survey's respondents still expect a stronger second half of the year, he said, "so it's no more than that -- a momentary soft spot."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report Wednesday on private-sector employment indicated a continued labor-market slowdown. <span class="companylink">Automatic Data Processing Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics estimated private employers added 119,000 jobs in April. That was below the firms' downwardly revised estimate of a rise of 131,000 jobs in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures reinforced worries about a deceleration in job growth after the Labor Department's official report last month showed an increase of just 88,000 jobs in March. Before the ADP release, forecasters had been estimating the government would report on Friday that April nonfarm payrolls nationwide increased by about 150,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data available for March and April so far suggest the U.S. economy is slowing in the spring just as it has in each of the past three years, even as some parts of the economy -- such as housing and auto sales -- remain resilient. But that doesn't appear to be enough to offset the impact of federal budget cuts and slower overseas growth that are restraining the U.S. economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report on March construction activity released Wednesday by the Commerce Department showed a 1.7% decline in construction spending in March. A pullback from governments and businesses outweighed an increase in residential construction tied to the improving housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many businesses remain hesitant to boost their expansion plans too quickly given the risks across the economy. The Commerce Department last week reported that the nation's gross domestic product expanded at a 2.5% annual rate in the first quarter, slower than many analysts expected in part due to a hit to federal spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As long as we continue to undershoot GDP and undershoot employment, everybody is understandably cautious and nervous. And no one wants to buy more than they absolutely need," <span class="companylink">U.S. Steel Corp</span>. CEO John Surma told investors this week after the company reported an 11% drop in first-quarter sales from a year earlier. He said the residential housing market "is moving in the right direction . . . but nonresidential is going to take a while."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM's factory gauge was held back in part by companies stockpiling fewer raw materials as they waited for prices to drop further as global commodity markets cool. Those lower prices could cushion some manufacturers' bottom lines in the coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the ISM survey, a number of manufacturers still reported steady or even stronger demand. The group said 14 out of 18 manufacturing industries reported expansion during the month, with key industries tied to housing and autos remaining strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cutbacks to federal spending appear to have hit manufacturers of electronic equipment and the transportation sector, particularly firms that make defense aircraft.</p>

</div><div class="author">By A.D. Pruitt and Dawn Wotapka </div><div>738 words</div><div>1 May 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An apartment complex in suburban Chicago was saved from the clutches of gentrification by a private real-estate investment trust formed to buy and protect affordable housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property, serving a working-class section of Aurora, Ill., was acquired for $5.2 million by a Chicago unit of Denver-based Mercy Housing Inc. in a joint venture with Housing Partnership Equity Trust, a private REIT that was created by Mercy and 11 other housing-related nonprofits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the deal was small, it is significant in that it was the first acquisition made by a real-estate company owned and operated by nonprofits and illustrates how organizations with a social mission can use the for-profit structure to advance their goals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing Partnership has raised over $100 million from investors, including <span class="companylink">Citigroup Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> and <span class="companylink">Prudential Financial Inc</span>., as well as the <span class="companylink">John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation</span>. The money will be chasing additional acquisitions in the future, says Drew Ades, Housing Partnership's chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing advocates have been alarmed by the rapid decline in the supply of affordable housing, the result of landlords scooping up low-income properties and converting them to luxury dwellings to capitalize on rising values for multifamily properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increased activity of for-profits has made it difficult for nonprofits to remain active buyers; they can't pay the high price tags or move quickly. "We're losing affordable units like crazy," says Cindy Holler, president of Mercy Housing Lakefront, the Chicago office of Mercy Housing, one of the country's largest nonprofits dedicated to affordable housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To compete with the profit-making companies for properties, the housing advocates are combining the benefits of their nonprofit structure with the financial flexibility that comes from operating a REIT.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We were only able to get this property because of this REIT structure," says Ms. Holler, noting that Mercy closed on the property in three months instead of the two years it would typically take to raise financing strictly through the nonprofit channels. Yet, Mercy's nonprofit status came in handy given it was able to use state tax credits to secure the property at a below-market rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is a stock of affordable housing that's really much more appropriate in mission-driven hands," says Mr. Ades, the former executive director of multifamily risk at <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>. "You have private investors that are coming in and purchasing these properties, hoping to get 12%, 15% and 20% returns. The only way that happens is if you increase the rents," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard said in its 2011 report that the recession increased the pool of low-income renters at the same time competition for cheaper affordable housing units became more fierce. Renters earning $15,000 or less rose by 2.2 million over the past decade, as affordable rentals declined by 470,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of tenants at the Aurora property expressed relief their new landlord would keep rents affordable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We couldn't afford any more than what we're paying," said 64-year-old Sharon Wetherbe, who lives in the complex with her husband. She said they probably would have to move into a nursing home if they had to leave their two-bedroom apartment where they pay $855 a month, accounting for half of their monthly income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average income for residents at the complex is about $26,000 a year, where they have access to an outdoor pool with a sun deck, covered parking and a community room with free Wi-Fi. Their rent is substantially lower than the average in Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ades, declined to disclose the projected returns of the REIT, but estimated the capitalization rate for the acquisition was relatively high at about 7%, indicating a strong initial yield for the buyer. The average cap rate for apartments nationally was 6.1% in the first quarter, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>. In major metro areas, where investor demand for apartments remains strong, the rate was 5.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to Mercy, other owners of Housing Partnership include Homes for America Inc. based in Annapolis, Md., LINC Housing Corp. of Long Beach, Calif., and NHP Foundation in New York.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Matthew Walter   </div><div>491 words</div><div>29 April 2013</div><div>16:36</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro notched modest gains amid rising expectations the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> will announce new measures to stimulate the currency union's struggling economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors are anticipating the <span class="companylink">ECB</span> will reduce its benchmark lending rate by a quarter percentage point and announce a new initiative to funnel credit to small and midsize businesses in the euro zone that have had difficulty borrowing funds needed to boost investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While lower interest rates typically weigh on the value of a currency, any sign that policy makers are taking steps to relieve some of the economic and financial stress in Europe has given the euro more support. The <span class="companylink">ECB</span> is scheduled to announce its policy decision on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By late afternoon in New York, the euro was at $1.3094 from $1.3028 late Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traders also pushed the euro higher after Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta and his cabinet were sworn in Sunday, ending weeks of political uncertainty in one of Europe's most fragile economies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In Europe there's enthusiasm for a new Italian government, and a lot of people are not only expecting a rate cut [from the <span class="companylink">ECB</span>] but an announcement of some sort of major stimulus program," said Steven Englander, senior currency strategists at <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, he cautioned the euro may be vulnerable to a selloff if the <span class="companylink">ECB</span> disappoints the market by either failing to cut rates, or by signaling that it may not implement a new stimulus program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar was buffeted by a series of economic indicators offering an uneven view of the U.S. economy. An index of pending home sales rose in March to its highest level in three years, a sign that the U.S. housing market continues to recover. But the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas</span> , meanwhile, reported that manufacturing activity in Texas contracted this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed 's policy-setting committee begins a two-day meeting on Tuesday, and investors will look for guidance from the central bank's statement this week on whether it will make changes to its current bond-buying program. The Fed is buying $85 billion a month in Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities to support the economy, and some policy makers this year have discussed the need to begin tapering those purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market is likely fretting that the FOMC won't change its tune as U.S. data has disappointed," said John Hardy , head of foreign exchange strategy at Saxo Capital Markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar recentlt traded at ¥97.97 from ¥98.06 late Friday. The U.K. pound bought $1.5492 from $1.5489. Against the Swiss franc, the dollar was at CHF0.9376 from CHF0.9412.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wall Street Journal Dollar Index, which measures the dollar against a basket of currencies, was at 73.38 from 73.653.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kris Hudson </div><div>701 words</div><div>29 April 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A22</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The retail market in the Bronx, long a stepchild to the shopping scenes in Manhattan and other boroughs, is reviving with new centers expected to bring national retailers to the neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Equity One Inc</span>., a real-estate investment trust that owns 144 retail centers, has started construction on a multilevel, 135,000-square-foot shopping center on the site of a former city parking lot at 171 W. 230th St. in the Kingsbridge area. The REIT expects that the center, slated to open in fall 2014, will include soft-goods stores, a sporting-goods store and perhaps a small grocer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, eight blocks to the north on Broadway, a venture of Metropolitan Realty Associates and <span class="companylink">Angelo Gordon &amp; Co</span>. is building a shopping center on the site of the former Stella D'Oro cookie factory. The 162,000-square-foot Riverdale Crossing shopping center is expected to include <span class="companylink">BJ's Wholesale Club Inc</span>. and several small shops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We think these two projects are going to really bookend the Kingsbridge district, and there will be a lot going on down there," says John DeSio, a spokesman for Bronx borough president Ruben Diaz Jr.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Equity One, based in North Miami Beach, Fla., won approval from the city in 2012 to purchase and build on the 80,000-square-foot lot at 230th Street and Broadway. The lot previously was to be developed as a larger shopping center, but the city rescinded that agreement in 2011 for lack of progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, Equity One anticipates that its plan for a shopping center at the site, where construction started in March, will cost more than $50 million, including the land purchase. Michael Berfield, Equity One's executive vice president of development, said lease rates at the center will range from $30 to $50 per square foot per year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The REIT, which hasn't announced signed leases, is financing the project with its own capital rather than seeking a construction loan. Typically, lenders won't allow borrowers to start construction on a retail center until a certain percentage of the square footage -- often at least 50% -- is committed to stores in leases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Equity One's strategy to build the Bronx center as a speculative project "is an indication of our confidence in the neighborhood," Mr. Berfield said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent decades, the Bronx, a borough of 1.4 million people, mostly hosted small, independent retailers at the base of apartment and office buildings. But lately, several large retail projects have emerged to establish it as a retail destination with nationally known stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Bronx now is being repositioned for a much more dynamic retail environment," says Faith Hope Consolo, who leads retail leasing for brokerage <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</span> in Manhattan. "It's not just local shops. It's now national and international retail."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Related Cos.' three-story Bronx Terminal Market retail complex opened near Yankee Stadium in 2009. Next year, Prestige Properties intends to open the 780,000-square-foot Mall at Bay Plaza at the intersection of Interstate 95 and Hutchinson River Parkway. The mall will be anchored by <span class="companylink">Macy's Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">J.C. Penney Co</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"First it was Queens, then it was Brooklyn and now it's the Bronx that is being realized as a growing, underserviced market," says David Rosenberg, executive vice president at retail brokerage <span class="companylink">Robert K. Futterman &amp; Associates LLC</span>. "It's really just a natural progression of the retailers figuring out that there's another two million plus people to tap into."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the Bronx has more to do to catch up with the rest of New York City. Its retail vacancy rate fell to 6.1% in the first quarter from 6.2% in the previous quarter, but remains higher than in Manhattan and the other boroughs, according to real-estate research firm CoStar Group. Bronx asking rents declined to $30 per square foot per year in the first quarter, from $30.97 in the previous quarter and well less than the four-year high of $35.49 in 2009, CoStar says.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">The Money Game --- Warning: Property Foreclosures Ahead: Small companies face balloon payments on their mortgages -- and no way to raise the money</span>
</div><div class="author">By Emily Maltby </div><div>1144 words</div><div>29 April 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>R3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many small firms that own commercial property are facing big trouble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is simple: Banks typically re-evaluate commercial mortgages every five to 10 years. At that point, they can renew the loans, or ask business owners to pay them off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, lenders are a lot less willing to extend loans that don't seem like good bets -- and it's tough for businesses to look creditworthy after years of slumped sales and exhausted savings. "So many small businesses have lost their reserves during the recession," says Brent Case, president of Coldwell Banker Commercial <span class="companylink">Atlantic International</span> Inc., in Charleston, S.C. "They don't have that chunk of cash that banks want as a buffer."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That leaves many small-business owners scrambling to find a lender that will cover their loan -- or facing the loss of their property through foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For an idea of the scope the problem, consider this: Some $276.2 billion of nonresidential commercial-property loans are expected to come due in 2013. That's higher than any prior year, according to <span class="companylink">Trepp LLC</span>, a commercial-mortgage research firm in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of these loans were made leading up to the financial collapse in 2008, when property values were high and business owners could depend on steady income to repay the loan. In other cases, the loans came due in the depths of the financial crisis, but banks were willing to give businesses extensions -- essentially pushing the question of refinancing to a later date. Some analysts estimate as many as 60% of commercial real-estate loans that came due were extended during this period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the extension periods have been coming to an end. Borrowers are again confronting big balloon payments they can't make -- and banks are more willing to foreclose. They're better capitalized than they've been in years and "are in a position to take a hit" on a loan, says Dan Fasulo, managing director of Real Capital Analytics Inc., a commercial real-estate research firm in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bud Matthews of Chapel Hill, N.C., faced a five-year balloon payment of $240,000 in 2006 and had no trouble refinancing with <span class="companylink">SunTrust Banks Inc</span>. But when the second balloon payment came due in June 2011, he couldn't find a bank to refinance the roughly $200,000 still outstanding. "We went to other banks, and they'd say, 'You are a good bet, but not good enough,' " says the 61-year-old, who occupies a commercial office for his 15-person construction and appliance-repair firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After much negotiating, the bank extended the loan through August 2012, but when it came due, Mr. Matthews couldn't pay the outstanding amount in full. The bank didn't want to refinance and started the foreclosure process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Days before Mr. Matthews's property was scheduled to be auctioned in February, Harrington Bank, a local lender, agreed to assume the loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hugh Suhr, vice president of corporate communications for SunTrust, says, "While we are not at liberty to discuss specific client relationships, we make every effort to work with clients on a case-by-case basis . . . in order to reach an outcome that best addresses the needs of all involved parties."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the number of loans coming due this year, and banks taking a critical eye to loan applications, it seems the problems will drag out for a number of years. As of mid-2012, about one in three loans coming due through 2016 was under water, meaning the property is worth less than what's owed, according to one estimate from Trepp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We can look out three to four years and know with certainty that a super amount of debt will come due that can't be dealt with in an ordinary way," says Phil Jemmett, chief executive at Breakwater Equity Partners, a San Diego consultancy and investment firm that specializes in troubled commercial real estate. "Roughly 20,000 small commercial properties . . . are facing distress in the next 12 months. We expect similar numbers in the next three years, and then it will taper off after 2016."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The incoming debt could trigger a "wave of foreclosures," says Tom Watson, CEO of JPB Commercial Real Estate Advisors LLC, a brokerage and real-estate consulting firm in Miramar Beach, Fla. The size of that wave, he says, will depend on whether the economy continues to improve. If it does, banks will steadily agree to refinance loans and offset the number of foreclosures that would have otherwise transpired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, commercial real-estate analysts largely agree that the commercial real-estate market won't experience a full-on collapse. One January report found that 60% of $399 billion in troubled commercial real-estate assets tracked since 2008 have been bought by a third-party investor or refinanced with a lender. But the report, from <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, evaluates properties valued at greater than $2.5 million. The smallest businesses may have the longest road to normalcy. Small properties "are much less attractive to the banks, especially larger banks," says Matthew Anderson, managing director at Trepp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January 2008, the Spiliadis family, Stelios, Pauline and their son, Dimitris, received a $5.06 million loan from 1st Mariner Bank to build the Inn at the Black Olive. The property narrowly escaped a foreclosure auction late last month when the business filed for bankruptcy -- a legal maneuver that prevented the auction from going forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Black Olive, which touts environmentally friendly features including solar panels, geothermal wells and recycled wood furniture, was under construction during the depths of the recession. After construction, the elder Mr. Spiliadis, 74, applied for the loan to roll into a 20-year mortgage with balloon payments every three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the inn, which opened in March 2011, wasn't a good bet for the bank. The property value had plummeted, and cash flow was tight. Mr. Spiliadis asked the state of Maryland to provide a $1.5 million loan guarantee, but it never materialized. 1st Mariner, which declined to comment, didn't refinance the debt and Mr. Spiliadis stopped making monthly interest payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now in Chapter 7, the business is bringing in enough sales to sustain operations, says Mr. Spiliadis, but the family is not in the clear -- they have until June to find an investor. If no investor steps up, the business will likely be on the auction block once again.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Candace Jackson </div><div>951 words</div><div>26 April 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York may be home to some of the world's priciest real estate, but when it comes to upfront costs, it can be a bargain for buyers -- at least compared with Hong Kong, Singapore and London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An overseas buyer of a Hong Kong home priced at about $15.26 million can expect to pay nearly 25% of the purchase price in fees and taxes, or about $3.75 million. In New York, by contrast, a similarly priced apartment will cost a buyer $217,980 in fees and taxes. But there's a trade-off: New Yorkers are typically hit by far higher property taxes during the years they occupy the home -- and they'll pay another hefty sum when it comes time to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new report to be released Friday by real-estate brokerage Savills, <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> and London-based property design and development management company Candy &amp; Candy compares the cost of buying and selling a GBP 10 million property (about $15.26 million) in New York, London, Hong Kong and Singapore. Wealthy international buyers have driven up prices for top properties in each of these markets in recent years, but the cost of such transactions (as well as annual taxes) vary widely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In London, upfront stamp duties and fees for a high-end property total 7.1% of the total purchase price, or about $1.09 million. Singapore has an even higher purchase fee for overseas buyers: 18%, or about $2.75 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The math has changed in recent months and years, as government efforts to curb property inflation from the influx of foreign buyers have resulted in new fees and taxes, says Yolande Barnes, head of world research at Savills. "It was a deliberate attempt to stop the overseas buyers from saturating the housing market," she adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In prime central London, where prices are up by more than 25% from the previous peak in 2007, and nearly two-thirds of top-tier buyers are foreign, a newly enacted measure charges a 15.1% purchase tax rate for buyers who buy homes through offshore companies that cloak their identities. (The rate for other buyers of a GBP 10 million property is 7%.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nick Candy, CEO of Candy &amp; Candy, whose London luxury condominium One Hyde Park has commanded prices upward of $200 million, primarily from foreign buyers, is concerned about the rising fees and taxes. He says that if fees for wealthy buyers rise any higher, "it will put off international purchasers" and drive them to cities like New York that have just as much global cachet, an economy that has recovered faster from the downturn and lower fees for buying real estate. "The government has done everything it can here to make it difficult for overseas buying."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Annual property taxes and selling costs, however, somewhat level the playing field, he says. The cost of selling a $15.26 million property in New York, at $1.13 million, is more than 12 times the cost to sell in London. For an apartment valued at $15.26 million, property taxes in New York could run a buyer $1.43 million over five years, compared with just $16,470 in London. However, many newer buildings in New York have received tax abatements, which significantly lower what owners pay in property taxes. In addition, in many new buildings, developers often pass the selling costs on to buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The marketplace for pricey properties shows few signs of slowing, according to the report, released through Candy &amp; Candy's biannual magazine. The ranks of the ultrawealthy have grown dramatically, with the number of billionaires up by 10% in the last year alone. Global wealth is predicted to increase from $122 trillion to $150 trillion over the next five years. And Mr. Candy says the wealthy increasingly see real estate in major capital cities as a relatively safe place to invest their assets, even during turbulent times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly one-third of buyers in Singapore in 2011 were foreigners, more than double the number seen a decade before. Chinese buyers from mainland China have been snapping up prime properties in Hong Kong. (The four cities in the report were chosen for their appeal to wealthy buyers from overseas, particularly those from emerging economies.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Barnes, of Savills, says despite new fees and taxes that may curb buying activity, the wealthy will still invest in property overseas. "For the ultrawealthy, I think it's almost misleading to think of these as home purchases," she says. "It's more like setting up a global headquarters. There are places in the world that any self-respecting billionaire needs to be."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anya Martin   </div><div>758 words</div><div>26 April 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To buy a house, some people are going through double the trouble -- getting two conventional loans instead of one jumbo mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Called "piggybacking," the practice helps buyers avoid the higher interest rates and larger down payments that typically come with jumbo loans, defined as above $417,000 in most parts of the country and $625,000 in high-cost areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Piggybacking was popular in the mid-2000s before the mortgage crisis, and it received some of the blame for facilitating home purchases with no or little money down, said Randy Carver, president of Mentor, Ohio-based Carver Financial Services, which provides financial planning for high-net-worth individuals. While more lenders have been allowing piggybacking lately, some say it may be more cost effective to get a jumbo loan, since interest rates are at historic lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jumbo mortgage rates were as much as 0.875 percentage points higher than conventional, or "conforming," rates a year ago. Now, however, the 30-year jumbo rate is 3.75% and the 30-year fixed conforming rate was 3.65%, a difference of 0.10 percentage points on April 19, according to the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The differential in interest rates has narrowed in the last few months," said Tom Wind, executive vice president of residential lending at EverBank. Therefore, the cost-saving potential for two loans has disappeared for most borrowers, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With so little disparity in interest rates, buyers need to factor in the added expense of two sets of closing costs and how long they plan to own the home to see if two loans really will save them money or ultimately cost them more, Mr. Carver said. Also, not all lenders will permit two mortgages on a new home purchase, and it may especially not be allowed for a second home or investment-home purchase, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EverBank will only finance a primary mortgage, though it will consider loans where the borrower obtains a second mortgage from another lender, Mr. Wind said. If the second mortgage or home-equity loan has an adjustable rate, home buyers may see their payments go up if the economy strengthens and interest rates rise, he added. "If you can lock in one 30-year fixed rate, a jumbo mortgage may be really attractive right now," Mr. Wind said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Getting two loans may have higher costs. The second mortgage may have lower closing costs, but if paid off early, some lenders may require a buyer to pay deferred fees, further reducing any cost-savings, Mr. Wind added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A loan amount over $1 million may also require two appraisals, said James P. Mack, vice president of retail sales at Michigan Mutual, which makes mortgage loans up to $2.5 million in 30 states. Due to the risk associated with higher jumbo loans, appraisals are highly scrutinized to determine the loan-to-value ratio (LTV), the amount of the loan compared with the value of the home. Ideally, home value is close to the purchase price, but it may not always be the same as the appraised value in a stressed housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowers can obtain financing of up to 80% LTV, but the "sweet spot" for jumbo pricing is at 65% LTV or less, Mr. Mack said. "High loan-to-value jumbo loans are not out there," he said. "Someone with an 85% to 90% loan-to-value ratio will need a second-mortgage product if they can find one to do their financing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When weighing whether to have one jumbo mortgage loan or combine a conforming loan with a second mortgage or home-equity loan, borrowers should also consider the following:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Run all the numbers. Home buyers should carefully read a mortgage lender's disclosure statements and compare costs side-by-side for two loans or a single jumbo, Mr. Carver said. "You can see all the numbers if you take the time to read the good-faith estimate," he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Consider future financial needs. A second mortgage at the time of a home purchase can limit a homeowner's ability to qualify for a home-equity line of credit later, Mr. Wind said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Weigh the best use of your cash. Some home buyers may want the lower monthly payments or lower down payment of two loans because they see a larger return on their dollars through other investments, Mr. Mack said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Vauhini Vara </div><div>948 words</div><div>25 April 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A11B</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, many in the real-estate world balked at investing in Oakland because of its high crime and unemployment. Now, Oakland boosters are trying to use a new investment in a sprawling $1.5 billion waterfront complex to persuade developers and investors to take another look at the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese investment firm Zarsion Holdings Group announced earlier this month that it would help fund the city's Brooklyn Basin, a planned 65-acre complex on the Oakland estuary with housing, retail shops and parkland that has been in the works for more than a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zarsion and its Oakland-based partner, Signature Development Group, didn't disclose the terms of their agreement or the sum of Zarsion's investment, but Signature described Zarsion's share as substantial enough for the firm to be described as a "co-developer."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The growth of the city, Oakland, is very good," says Shan Weixun, Zarsion's chairman, adding that he is "very optimistic" about the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, local developers are pointing to the deal as evidence of Oakland's appeal and a reason for retailers to lease space near the site and for institutional investors to put funds into other nearby projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The real-estate community in Oakland is very excited," says Mike Ghielmetti, president of Signature Development Group. "It's an affirmation of what most of us already know, but coming out of the recession we're just getting our mojo back."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With funding secured for Brooklyn Basin, builders are expected to break ground on the project in late 2014 or early 2015, Mr. Ghielmetti says. The first residents and retail tenants would move in by late 2016, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has developers and others looking to capitalize on the promised influx of residents and businesses. Helen Bulwik, who advises national department-store chains on location decisions as a partner at the advisory firm Newport Board Group, says she has been trying for years to sell retailers on Oakland -- a city of 396,000 that, unlike nearby cities, lacks a thriving downtown retail area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, she says she is telling clients that Zarsion's investment provides even more reason for them to consider opening up shop on the Broadway corridor that runs from the waterfront near Brooklyn Basin to the northern part of the city. The Zarsion deal has led to "a renewed interest in saying yes" to Oakland, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers of Jack London Square, an Oakland waterfront area adjacent to the Brooklyn Basin that is known for its restaurants and bars, are also trying to capitalize on the deal. They are telling retailers who are considering leasing some space that Brooklyn Basin -- which will include 3,100 housing units -- will attract an influx of residents in need of basic amenities like a grocery store and pharmacy, which the area currently lacks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jack London Square's office space is 95% leased, but its retail space is less than half full, says Will Miller, senior vice president at <span class="companylink">Ellis Partners LLC</span>, an operating partner at Jack London Square.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When you're sitting and talking to prospects about all these plans, they say, 'Yeah, yeah, great,' because it's all just a plan," Mr. Miller says. "But when they hear that it's getting funded and the developer is moving forward, it brings a sense of reality and I think will assist us in moving those conversations forward."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oakland still has many problems. Crime remains rampant, with 1,365 robberies so far this year through April 21, up 22% from 1,117 at the same time last year, according to the Oakland Police Department, which has experienced layoffs amid budget cuts. While other crimes, including murders and rapes, are down from last year, the overall crime numbers remain higher than those of other Bay Area cities like San Francisco and San Jose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Oakland's proposed budget for the 2014 fiscal year released by Mayor Jean Quan last week revealed the city's finances are still in poor shape, with an expected shortfall of $12.3 million on revenue of $430.2 million, absent some cost-cutting measures Ms. Quan and the city administrator have proposed. And the city's unemployment rate of 11.8% in March is higher than San Francisco's 6% and San Jose's 7.9%, according to the <span class="companylink">California Employment Development Department</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott Johnson, the assistant city administrator, acknowledges the city must address those issues but points to factors like growing sales-tax revenue as evidence that Oakland is seeing a "renaissance."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city's problems have kept Charmaine Curtis, a San Francisco developer, from investing in Oakland since she built a 16-unit condominium building there in 2008. Still, she says San Francisco's soaring prices have encouraged her to look across the Bay for better deals. The Zarsion deal has given her an added boost, as she realized it could spur other developers to eye Oakland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Brooklyn Basin could be the tipping point for Oakland," says Ms. Curtis, who plans to go for a drive in Oakland to scope out some neighborhoods that might be on the cusp of growth. "It's a herd mentality -- once a few cows go into the pasture, everybody's going to run in and start sniffing around. My desire is to try to get a little ahead of the herd."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A false tweet about explosions at the White House briefly sent financial markets veering on Tuesday, underscoring technology's role in tightly linking global markets and highlighting the potential pitfalls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average and oil prices briefly plunged Tuesday afternoon and <span class="companylink">U.S. Treasury</span> bond prices soared after a tweet from the Associated Press's <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> account said that there were two explosions in the White House and that President Barack Obama had been injured.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markets quickly swung back after the Associated Press said on its corporate website that its account had been hacked. The White House confirmed that there had been no incident.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 145 points between 1:08 p.m. and 1:10 p.m. in New York, following the erroneous tweet. Stocks soon recovered, regaining broad advances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow industrials closed up 152.29 points, or 1.05%, at 14719.46, and the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index added 16.28 points, or 1%, to 1578.78. The <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> Composite advanced 35.78 points, or 1.1%, to 3269.33.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Europe, meanwhile, stocks surged Tuesday after a successful Spanish debt auction drove bond yields lower in Spain and Italy, and as weak economic data from the region raised hopes that the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> will cut interest rates to boost growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strong earnings reports on both sides of the Atlantic, along with data showing improvement in the U.S. housing market, also spurred buying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 index jumped 2.4% to 292.63. London's FTSE 100 rose 2% to 6406.12, Germany's DAX added 2.4% to 7658.21, and France's CAC surged 3.6% to 3783.05.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks started to move firmly higher in midmorning trade after Spain's government reportedly sold 3.011 billion euros ($3.93 billion) in Treasury bills at sharply lower funding costs than at previous auctions. In the secondary market, the yield on 10-year Spanish government bonds dropped 0.22 percentage point to 4.27%, touching the lowest level since November 2010, according to Tradeweb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Italy, the 10-year government-bond yield dropped below 4% for the first time since November 2010, falling 0.14 percentage point to 3.94%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spain's IBEX 35 stock index jumped 3.3% to 8289.30 and Italy's FTSE Mib rose 2.9% to 16490.77.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Germany's composite purchasing managers index fell to a six-month low of 48.8 in April from 50.6 in March; a reading below 50 signals contraction. Meanwhile, Markit's PMI for the euro zone was unchanged at 46.5 in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> said in a note that Tuesday's PMI data make an ECB rate cut more likely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ECB Governing Council member Jens Weidmann said last week that the bank could cut rates further if economic data warrant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro slipped to $1.2998 late Tuesday in New York from $1.3067 late Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. earnings were encouraging, as first-quarter numbers from <span class="companylink">DuPont</span>, Netflix and Coach beat expectations. <span class="companylink">Dupont</span> gained 4.15%, Netflix jumped 24%, and Coach rose 9.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of chip maker <span class="companylink">ARM Holdings</span> surged 12% in London after the company posted better-than-expected first-quarter earnings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Swedbank rose 5.7% in Stockholm after posting a consensus-beating rise in first-quarter net profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crude for June delivery slipped one cent a barrel to $89.18 on the <span class="companylink">New York Mercantile Exchange</span>.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's bad news for home buyers is good news for builders: The low inventory of previously owned houses for sale is driving up new-home sales -- and prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales jumped 1.5% in March to an annual pace of 417,000, the second-highest monthly sales pace in three years, according to data released Tuesday by the Commerce Department. Year-over-year March sales were up 18.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures come one day after the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> reported that there were just 1.93 million existing homes for sale last month, the lowest tally for the month of March since 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders, meanwhile, are increasing the number of new homes they are putting on the market. Tuesday's figures showed that there were 153,000 newly built homes listed for sale, adjusted for seasonal factors, which is the most since November 2011. That supply would take 4.4 months to deplete at the current sales pace, unchanged from February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Cottage Grove, Minn., Custom One Homes is on pace to sell about 25 homes this year -- about twice as many as last year, according to Mike Rygh, Custom's president. "Sales have been pretty strong. People are getting more confidence in their jobs. They've figured out that the economy has stabilized again," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the signs of strength as the spring selling season heats up, home sales remain well below historical levels. New-home sales peaked in July 2005, when they hit an annualized pace of nearly 1.4 million, and declined to a low of 273,000 in February 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, builders face some headwinds in coming months. The <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> reported earlier this month that builder confidence fell for the third straight month as increasing costs of land, labor and construction materials raised concerns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But conditions clearly are improving in numerous parts of the country. In California, inventories of existing homes have plummeted over the past year. According to real-estate website Realtor.com, nine of the 10 largest annual declines in existing-home inventory as of March occurred in California markets, including Stockton, Sacramento and Orange County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> economist Michelle Meyer said Tuesday's results indicate "a healthy start to the spring selling season," amid record home-price affordability, like historically low 30-year mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Builders have benefited from the sharp decline in inventory of existing properties, making new construction homes more competitive," Ms. Meyer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response to the rising demand, builders have restored the boom-era practice of requiring buyers to enter lotteries merely for the chance to make an offer on their favorite new homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Izo, who works in marketing for AAA, and his wife, Monica, had been renting in Dublin, Calif. -- about a half-hour drive from San Francisco -- before they decided to take advantage of low mortgage rates and buy a home early this year. They made offers on four existing homes, and were outbid by upward of 30 other buyers on each.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, Mr. Izo, 32 years old, noticed signs during a weekend drive for a lottery at a new community built by <span class="companylink">Shea Homes</span>, in Livermore, Calif.. He and his wife attended two Saturday-morning lotteries where they put down their names, then waited, shoulder-to-shoulder with dozens of other couples, for their number to be drawn from a tote bag. Last Saturday, at their second lottery, the Izos' number was finally drawn. This coming weekend they plan to sign a contract for a three-story, two-bedroom townhome, for $518,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We went to that lottery, prayers in hand, saying to ourselves, 'If this is meant to be, it'll happen,' " Mr. Izo said. "Every time we wrote an offer and it was rejected, it was a deflating feeling. . . . It's like a second full-time job, looking for a home."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders have also taken advantage of heightened demand to raise prices. The median sale price of a new home sold in March was $247,000, up 3% from a year ago. The median price of a new home was $247,900 at the tail of the housing boom in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A typical strategy is for a builder to release just five or six homes for sale at a time, and raise prices between releases after demand has been stoked. In Mountain House, Calif., <span class="companylink">Meritage Homes</span>, a large national builder, opened sales last September for 75 new homes at its Belmonte subdivision, with prices starting just below $280,000. By the time the community had sold out, in early March of this year, prices had risen by between $55,000 and $75,000 on every model.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's an excruciatingly tight supply in the market," said Barry Grant, Meritage's northern California division head. Buyers, Mr. Grant says, have gotten so used to bidding wars in the existing-home market that they have started offering more than the asking price for new homes, an unusual practice. "These are the salad days. They really are," Mr. Grant says. "We're doing very well."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors who snapped up <span class="companylink">Taylor Morrison Home Corp</span>.'s shares when it recently went public might want to start rooting for Toronto to skirt a condo bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Arizona home builder is long on Toronto high-rises at an unusually volatile time for real estate in Canada's biggest city. Taylor Morrison, known in the U.S. for its higher-end single-family homes, expects to complete three high-rise projects this year and an additional four in the Toronto area by the end of 2016. The projects are under way as a record 237 condo towers, most taller than 10 stories, are rising in the city and region's skyline, according to <span class="companylink">RealNet Canada Inc</span>., a real-estate research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taylor Morrison attracted enough investors to push the company to issue 20% more shares than expected. The shares are up about 6.7% from the initial public offering price, as the company became the latest home builder to tap Wall Street's growing confidence in the U.S. housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the stock's debut also shows the limits of the market's appetite for housing risk. Some analysts say investors' concern over the company's exposure to the frothy Toronto condo market weighed on the stock's pricing right out of the box.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Taylor Morrison got a haircut because of Canada," said Jack Micenko, an analyst with Susquehanna Financial Group, who has a "positive" rating on the stock. Taylor-Morrison shares were at $23.48, down 27 cents, in 4 p.m. trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange. "It's a choppy market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other companies in the home-building sector also have seen some recent volatility, though the Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction Index, which tracks public home builders, has risen 61.5% over the past 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As with many home builders, the outlook for Taylor Morrison has changed considerably in recent years. The company was a unit of British conglomerate <span class="companylink">Taylor Wimpey PLC</span> until early 2011, when a group of U.S. private-equity funds acquired it for nearly $1 billion. The move was seen as an effort by <span class="companylink">Taylor Wimpey</span> to retreat from the weak U.S. market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the tables are turning. Taylor Morrison's U.S. markets, including some like Phoenix that were among the hardest-hit by the housing crisis, are expected to be its growth engines. In regulatory filings, Taylor Morrison said the average sales price for the company's houses with deposits on them in the U.S. are expected to rise about 20%, to $398,000, in the first quarter from the year-earlier, while in Canada the average sales price was expected to be roughly flat. Closings in the U.S. are expected to rise 96% in the U.S. but decline 33% in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Taylor Morrison spokeswoman noted that Canada accounted for less than 20% of the company's net income last year. While the company has seen some generic slowing in Canada, she said much of the problem has been in the luxury condo market, while the company sells condos at a lower price point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She also said builders in Canada have some legal protections that they don't have in the U.S., such as legal recourse should a buyer who has put down a deposit opt to walk away. That reduces the cancellation rates even if prices fall or buyers get cold feet. "In Miami you had all those people walking from buildings. In Canada you wouldn't see that mass exodus," the spokeswoman said. "There are fundamental differences in Canada that make it a safer place to build high-rises."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city anchors a region of about five million that also is undergoing some changes that those fearing a condo-bust may not grasp, said George Carras, president of RealNet Canada. New land policy is reducing the amount of available parcels for single-family development in the region and pushing developers to build more-dense high-rise projects on remaining land, he said. At the same time, demand is increasing as the city's population rose to about 2.8 million last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of sales of new high-rise condo units in the Toronto region fell 7.2% in February to 952 from 1,026 a year-earlier, while prices fell 1.3% to 432,000 Canadian dollars (US$421,257), according to RealNet.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A false tweet about explosions at the White House briefly sent financial markets veering on Tuesday, underscoring technology's role in tightly linking global markets and highlighting the potential pitfalls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Dow Jones Industrial</span> Average and oil prices briefly plunged Tuesday afternoon and <span class="companylink">U.S. Treasury</span> bond prices soared after a tweet from the Associated Press's <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> account said that there were two explosions in the White House and that President Barack Obama had been injured.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markets quickly swung back after the Associated Press said on its corporate website that its account had been hacked. The White House confirmed that there had been no incident.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Dow Jones Industrial</span> Average dropped 145 points between 1:08 p.m. and 1:10 p.m. in New York, following the erroneous tweet. Stocks soon recovered, regaining broad advances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Dow</span> industrials closed up 152.29 points, or 1.05%, at 14719.46, and the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index added 16.28 points, or 1%, to 1578.78. The <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> Composite advanced 35.78 points, or 1.1%, to 3269.33.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Europe, meanwhile, stocks surged Tuesday after a successful Spanish debt auction drove bond yields lower in Spain and Italy, and as weak economic data from the region raised hopes that the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> will cut interest rates to boost growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strong earnings reports on both sides of the Atlantic, along with data showing improvement in the U.S. housing market, also spurred buying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 index jumped 2.4% to 292.63. London's FTSE 100 rose 2% to 6406.12, Germany's DAX added 2.4% to 7658.21, and France's CAC surged 3.6% to 3783.05.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks started to move firmly higher in midmorning trade after Spain's government reportedly sold €3.011 billion ($3.93 billion) in Treasury bills at sharply lower funding costs than at previous auctions. In the secondary market, the yield on 10-year Spanish government bonds dropped 0.22 percentage point to 4.27%, touching the lowest level since November 2010, according to Tradeweb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Italy, the 10-year government-bond yield dropped below 4% for the first time since November 2010, falling 0.14 percentage point to 3.94%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spain's IBEX 35 stock index jumped 3.3% to 8289.30 and Italy's FTSE Mib rose 2.9% to 16490.77.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Germany's composite purchasing managers index fell to a six-month low of 48.8 in April from 50.6 in March; a reading below 50 signals contraction. Meanwhile, Markit's PMI for the euro zone was unchanged at 46.5 in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> said in a note that Tuesday's PMI data make an ECB rate cut more likely. "Our current call is for June, but there is an increased chance that a [quarter percentage point] cut of the main refi rate could be delivered next week," it said. <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> will be looking to Wednesday's data releases for a clearer picture. "As the drag in today's PMI came from Germany, tomorrow's Ifo will give a more complete view of the German economy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ECB Governing Council member Jens Weidmann said last week that the bank could cut rates further if economic data warrant. The euro slipped to $1.2998 late Tuesday in New York from $1.3067 late Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. earnings were encouraging, as first-quarter numbers from <span class="companylink">DuPont</span>, Netflix and Coach beat expectations. <span class="companylink">Dupont</span> gained 4.15%, Netflix jumped 24%, and Coach rose 9.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of chip maker <span class="companylink">ARM Holdings</span> surged 12% in London after the company posted better-than-expected first-quarter earnings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Schneider Electric</span> gained 5.9% in Paris after the company maintained its 2013 sales-growth forecast despite a contraction in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Swedbank rose 5.7% in Stockholm after posting a consensus-beating rise in first-quarter net profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crude for June delivery slipped one cent a barrel to $89.18 on the <span class="companylink">New York Mercantile Exchange</span>, snapping a three-day winning streak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gold for April delivery lost $12.40 a troy ounce, or 0.9%, to $1,408.60 on the Comex division of Nymex, also ending a three-day streak of gains.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A century ago, a much-admired brick-and-limestone mansion was demolished on East 68th Street and Madison Avenue to make way for the latest innovation for the rich -- an 11-story Beaux-Arts building with many apartments larger than a typical townhouse in the neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The service is neither seen nor heard," gushed a report in the New York Herald in 1914, celebrating a separate wing for servants in each large apartment. In addition to bedrooms, there was a staff sitting room and dining room in the apartments. There were more maids rooms on the building's roof.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that building -- known as the Marquand for the owner of that old mansion, Henry G. Marquand, a founder and second president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art -- is being reinvented again on its 100th birthday and turned into lavishly finished condominiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The changes at the Marquand, at 11 E. 68th St., are part of a recent wave of half a dozen conversions of older buildings on the Upper East Side into condominiums, mainly into large, expensive apartments that have been reporting strong interest from wealthy buyers in recent months, during the rebound in the luxury market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The demand is extremely strong particularly for larger apartments," said Richard Wallgren, who is overseeing sales at two apartment buildings being converted to condos by Harry Macklowe, the real-estate developer and investor. At 737 Park Ave. at East 71st Street, he said more than 30% of the 19-story building is listed in contract, four months after a sales office opened. The building dates to 1940.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another project, Carlton House, the conversion of what had been a 1950 hotel at 61st Street and Madison, about 20% of the 68 condos are in contract, according to the developers, <span class="companylink">Extell Development Co</span>. and <span class="companylink">Angelo, Gordon &amp; Co</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Marquand, apartments that had been sliced and diced into smaller rental units during leaner decades are being restored to their original size or more, but without the wing for servants. Kitchens once the hidden preserve of the staff are now front and center, with counters and walls of Calacatta marble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Instead of upstairs downstairs, you have galleries for art, large canvasses of art," said Lee Mindel, of Shelton, Mindel &amp; Associates, an architect who redesigned the interiors. He said that the kitchens and the adjacent family rooms have been turned into "mini-apartments."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the rooftop maids rooms -- there were still 13 penthouse maids rooms listed in a certificate of occupancy in 1973 -- are being incorporated into two triplex penthouses with private terraces. The building, with dozens of bay windows, is divided into two wings built around a central courtyard that is being rebuilt with bluestone paving stones and gardens. It went on the market last week, with half-floors starting at $15 million. A model apartment is due to open next month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Marquand was once the site of three townhouses built for Mr. Marquand, a businessman who worked as a banker, a Wall Street broker and investor in railroads, according to an account published by the Met.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The elaborate Victorian houses were designed in the early 1880s by Richard M. Hunt, the architect who designed the facade of the Met. Mr. Marquand's 42-foot-wide corner home was celebrated for its elaborate design, its expensive furnishings, art collection and an iron conservatory that looked out over then-bucolic Madison Avenue. U.S. President Grover Cleveland lived for a time in one of the adjacent Marquand houses when he practiced law in the city after his firm term in the White House.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after Mr. Marquand's death in 1902, the house, which cost more than $1 million to build and furnish, couldn't find a private buyer, and it was eventually sold to a group of investors for $500,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They then acquired the other two houses as well. The new building, the first multifamily structure on the block, was designed by architect Herbert Lucas, who also headed up the investor group. It was designed with ceiling heights of more than 10 feet, and incorporated shields with an M for Marquand cut into stone on the exterior.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon after, amid the labor shortages of World War I, the use of an army of household servants began to decline, and some of the apartments were chopped up for smaller rental units, Mr. Mindel said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of 2011, the building was sold for $170 million to two developers who split it up. <span class="companylink">Vornado Realty Trust</span> took over a 100-foot-long prime retail space on Madison Avenue, while Ziel Feldman and HFZ Capital Group kept the apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Feldman said the building has 44 apartments that will be eventually consolidated to between 25 and 30 condos. Nine apartments still have rent-regulated tenants, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in 1913, the cost of acquiring the land and putting up 11 E. 68th St. was put at $1.6 million. Now Mr. Feldman's conversion plan has a total offering price of $342 million, state records show.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. blue chips fell Monday, although the broader market was more resilient, as investors weighed disappointing results from Caterpillar and a surprise decline in existing home sales against good news from Asia and Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 52 points, or 0.4%, to 14496 in midday trading. Last week, the Dow fell 318 points, or 2.1%, for its biggest weekly point and percentage decline since the week ended June 1, 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index fell less than 0.1% to 1555, while the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> Composite Index added eight points, or 0.3%, to 3214.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markets are reflecting a "tug of war" between investors who expect growth and those who don't, said Frank Trotter, president with EverBank Direct and chief executive of EverBank Wealth Management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks extended losses after the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> reported a surprise decline in sales of previously owned homes. Existing-home sales declined 0.6% in March to a seasonally adjusted rate of 4.92 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The expectation is that the housing sector is one of the tailwinds for the economy, so any report that suggests weakness or otherwise is going to be viewed pretty negatively," said Hank Smith, chief investment of Radnor, Pa.-based <span class="companylink">Haverford</span> Trust, which manages $6.5 billion in assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Caterpillar reported results that fell short of analysts' estimates. The Dow component, seen as a bellwether for global economic growth, provided a downbeat full-year outlook, amid weakness in its mining business and expectations of continued slow global economic growth. Still, shares of the blue-chip machinery maker edged up 0.6%. The stock lost 5.4% last week in anticipation of weak results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At the end of the day, earnings are what's going to matter," said Dan Greenhaus, chief global strategist with <span class="companylink">BTIG LLC</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. stocks made a short-lived attempt to stem last week's losses in early trading after finance ministers from the <span class="companylink">Group of 20</span> major economies signaled approval of the <span class="companylink">Bank of Japan</span>'s aggressive stimulus measures, and a deadlock in the Italian presidential election was cleared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apple shares gained 1.7%, after falling 9.1% last week to close at the lowest level since December 2011. The company's fiscal second-quarter results are due out after Tuesday's closing bell and analysts expect a sharp year-over-year drop in earnings as a result of weakening demand for iPhones and iPads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dow component <span class="companylink">General Electric</span> slipped 2.2% after <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span> cut its rating on the industrial conglomerate to "neutral." The bank had kept a "buy" rating on the stock since September 2009. On Friday, GE shed 4.1% after the company said Europe's weak economy could continue to hurt results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Halliburton rallied 4.1% after reporting earnings that were well above forecasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treasury bond prices edged higher amid investor caution over the economic outlook. The benchmark 10-year Treasury added 1/32, yielding 1.705%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European Stocks</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares rose broadly as the re-election of Italy's president, Giorgio Napolitano, fueled hopes that a new government could soon be in place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The benchmark Stoxx 600 index rose 0.2% to 285.68. Italy's FTSE Mib advanced 1.7% to 16021.71.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank shares rallied. Italy's Banco Popolare added 4.5%, <span class="companylink">UniCredit</span> gained 2.7% and <span class="companylink">Intesa Sanpaolo</span> advanced 1.8%. <span class="companylink">Credit Agricole</span> gained 1% and <span class="companylink">Societe Generale</span> rose 0.9% in France.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investment bank <span class="companylink">Natixis</span> rose 4.3% after <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> lifted the French firm to "outperform" from "neutral."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Delhaize Group</span> jumped 11% after the Belgian food retailer reported a 3.8% increase in first-quarter organic revenue growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Royal Philips Electronics</span> sank 5.2% after the firm said it continues to see a slow first half of the year due to difficult market trends, particularly in Europe and the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Norwegian fertilizer firm <span class="companylink">Yara International</span> lost 4% after reporting a 25% fall in first-quarter profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Royal Philips Electronics</span> slipped 5.2% as first-quarter sales, especially in its health-care and lighting businesses, came in weaker than some analysts had expected.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Min Zeng </div><div>490 words</div><div>22 April 2013</div><div>16:19</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Concerns over the economic outlook helped Treasury bonds claw back earlier price losses, but looming new debt sales kept the market's rebound in check.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The benchmark 10-year Treasury note was 2/32 higher in late-afternoon trade, yielding 1.696%. The yield was trading near a four-month low. Bond prices move inversely to their yields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for the safe-harbor asset initially fell after the <span class="companylink">Group of 20</span> industrialized and developing countries refrained from slamming Japan's aggressive monetary stimulus that has weakened the yen. Investors believe fresh liquidity from Japan, on the back of ongoing money-printing from the Federal Reserve, could boost growth prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treasury prices also lost some ground when Italy ended weeks of limbo and elected a president, fueling a rally in Italian and Spanish government bonds and boosting riskier assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the bond market shifted in favor of bulls after <span class="companylink">Caterpillar Inc</span>.'s first-quarter net profit fell 45% amid a broad-based revenue decline, while existing home sales in March posted an unexpected decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There has been bottom fishing in Treasury bonds" driven by continued uneasiness on the economic situation in Europe and the U.S., said Mary Ann Hurley, vice president of trading in Seattle at <span class="companylink">D.A. Davidson &amp; Co</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prospects that the <span class="companylink">Bank of Japan</span>'s stimulus would drive Japanese investors, including pension funds and life insurance companies, to buy high-grade fixed-income assets overseas also lured in fresh buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-year Treasury yield is much higher than the 0.61% yield on 10-year Japanese government bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is still a lot going on favoring Treasurys," said Hicham Hajhamou, director of Treasury trading at <span class="companylink">Pierpont Securities</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Upcoming new debt sales tempered the bond market's ascent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Treasury Department is scheduled to sell $99 billion in Treasury notes this week, including $35 billion in two-year notes Tuesday, $35 billion in five-year notes Wednesday and $29 billion in seven-year notes Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treasury yields have dropped in recent weeks as concerns rose over the pace of economic recovery in the U.S. following disappointing data on employment, consumer spending and manufacturing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-year Treasury note's yield has dropped from 2.086% in March, the peak of this year so far. The yield now trades below 1.76%, where the security ended 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors are worried that growth could lose traction again just like it did in the past few years, though some analysts argue a recovering housing market would boost growth prospects this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bond yields would rise again if upcoming data renew optimism over the growth outlook. In this case, the Federal Reserve could start pulling back on buying Treasury bonds before the end of this year, which would remove a main support for bond bulls in holding down bond yields.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anjali Athavaley </div><div>746 words</div><div>22 April 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A20</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Vornado Realty Trust</span> is planning to give makeovers to some of its buildings in the neighborhoods around Pennsylvania Station, an area that's been slowly improving but still falling far short of planners' dreams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, city officials and landlords have had grand schemes for turning the area into a retail and entertainment Mecca surrounding a new Madison Square Garden and train station relocated into the Corinthian column-lined James A. Farley Post Office. But most of those plans have been either delayed or shelved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vornado, one of the biggest office and retail landlords in the area, is moving ahead on its own with more modest projects. The company has decided to convert its building at 7 W. 34th St. currently occupied by a home decor showrooms, back into an office building. The idea is partly to tap into high demand for space from technology and media companies that are expanding in many parts of the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vornado also is working on an upgrade of the Hotel Pennsylvania, a 1,700-room lodging across Seventh Avenue from Penn Station. Vornado, until recently, was considering replacing the hotel with an office skyscraper, but the company opted against that move partly because office rents and demand aren't strong enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, Vornado is in talks with operators and developers to bring in a hotel partner, perhaps one that would be connected with an international chain. The company also is buying out retailers. "We're in the process of turning over and buying out a lot of the retail tenants on the street so that we can populate them with better, more contemporary, more exciting tenants and restaurants all over the place," Vornado's chairman and chief executive Steven Roth told investors at a <span class="companylink">Citigroup Inc</span>. conference in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vornado executives declined to comment. But in recent weeks they have been telling investors some details of their plans. "There's the extraordinary opportunity to create value, change the culture in the retail and in the Hotel Pennsylvania," Mr. Roth said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers say the area has made progress but still has room for improvement. Tenants like <span class="companylink">H&amp;M</span>, Forever 21 and the Gap increasingly are showing up, says Faith Hope Consolo, chairman of the retail group at <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She says of Vornado, "They own that area. Ever since they came into that area, it has only gotten better."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But she points out that the Herald Square area has seen the most progress and that some neighborhoods further to the west need improvement. "It's a domino effect," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2006, Mr. Roth told investors yesterday that the plan to remake Penn Station and move Madison Square Garden would add $1.2 billion in value to the company's nearly 7 million square feet of property in the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vornado purchased the 450,000-square foot office building at 7 W. 34th St. in 2000 and began leasing it out to home decor companies as showroom space in 2005. The company's move to convert it back into office space comes as Vornado is winding down its furniture showroom division. Last year, the company said that <span class="companylink">Google Inc</span>.'s <span class="companylink">Motorola Mobility</span> would lease 572,000 square feet in Vornado's Chicago Merchandise Mart building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vornado said in a letter to investors earlier this month that average rents in Penn Plaza have steadily grown from $37.98 a square foot in 2003 to $51.16 a square foot in 2012. Vornado says it benefits from spillover from Chelsea and Park Avenue South, "which are flooded by tech firms and workers who don't wear ties."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Technology companies are looking for space around Penn Station because rents are rising in Midtown South neighborhoods like the Meatpacking District. "Pricing in Midtown South has gone up substantially over the past three years, and those tenants are starting to push further north looking for space," says Paul Walker, first vice president at brokerage firm <span class="companylink">CBRE Group Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He pointed to the Setai hotel at 36th Street and Fifth Avenue and cocktail bar the Liberty on 35th Street as evidence of a transformation in the area near 7 W. 34th St. "It's becoming a more desirable place for the young companies to occupy," Mr. Walker said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael and Amy Cohen live in a classic, stately stone Colonial. Until you step inside, that is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Following a recent remodel, the four-bedroom, three-story house, built in the 1920s in the West Mount Airy section of Philadelphia, has an electric-blue fireplace and a wall that doubles as a "found art" installation project, with multicolored plastic bread tags embedded in a large pane of clear Plexiglas. A custom-made living-room rug echoes the shapes and drips of a painting Mr. Cohen made in preschool and matches the <span class="companylink">Coca-Cola</span> -red sofa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Brick and stone says 'home' to me. But I really like modern design. I never thought that exterior and interior had to agree," says Ms. Cohen, 48, a high-school and middle-school social-studies teacher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a tough time to build new. Construction costs have risen sharply over the past year, while existing-home prices, though rising, are still about a third below their peak. As a result, the number of custom single-family homes built in the U.S. last year was less than half the number built in 2005, according to Robert Denk, senior economist at the National Association of Home Builders . And finding an existing contemporary or modern house can be difficult, especially in older cities and towns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what's a modern-design aficionado to do? Redo an older home. Remodeling spending is up 9% over last year, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard. And according to Sheila Schmitz, editor in chief of home-décor website Houzz , there has been an increase in popularity of the "transitional" look, which blends the comfort and warmth of traditional design with the clean profiles and understated colors of contemporary counterparts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The concept of installing a modern interior inside a traditional home, long seen in Europe, is becoming particularly popular in older U.S. cities. In San Francisco, architect Stephen Verner of Aleck Wilson Architects says most of his clients want contemporary interiors even in the oldest homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pittsburgh-based architect Lewko Korzeniwsky recently finished turning the traditional, Colonial-style floor plan of an old 4,600-square-foot French Normandy mansion into an open, contemporary interior, reducing the number of bedrooms to four from six and introducing floor-to-ceiling glass windows and recessed lighting. Mr. Korzeniwsky says he is getting many more requests for projects that keep the exteriors but modernize the interiors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This "hybrid" phenomenon is particularly evident in Philadelphia. The city is full of old stone and brick homes. Construction costs are among the highest in the country, reflecting taxes, union labor rates and extensive regulations. And strict historical codes can make it difficult to change a house's exterior. Yet the way people live has become increasingly contemporary, say architects and designers, so more owners are demanding interior changes to incorporate bigger kitchens, cleaner lines and open floor plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market has been responding positively. Bruce Benjamin, a real-estate agent at Plumer &amp; Associates, says houses whose interiors have been renovated in a contemporary way appeal to buyers because they're a "refreshing" change and, as a result, have a higher resale value. He points to a 2,300-square-foot, 150-year-old townhouse that sold last summer for its asking price of $1.15 million even though it lacked parking, usually a must for that price category. Mr. Benjamin attributes the sale price to the home's modern interior.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"No one in their right mind would knock down one of these beautiful old houses," says Alan Metcalfe , the principal at Metcalfe Architecture &amp; Design in Philadelphia who designed the remodel for the Cohens. "It is a matter of reorienting them to the way people live." Local architects estimate modern redos cost about $200 a square foot in Philadelphia, depending on the materials and scope of the work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Built in 1800, Hank McNeil's Neo-Georgian 13,000-square-foot Rittenhouse Square mansion is red brick and cube-shaped, with rectangular double-hung windows all aligned and a red front door flanked by Corinthian columns. When Mr. McNeil bought it in 2003 for $1.3 million, it had been converted into law offices, with the interior rooms chopped up. Now, the interior is highly contemporary, and filled with one of the leading collections of minimalist modern art in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McNeil, an heir to the Tylenol fortune, couldn't touch the exterior due to historical regulations. So he turned his attention inside, knocking down walls to create three rooms on the main floor. He installed glass doors, skylights and modern Bulthaup cabinets in the open kitchen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overall interior look of Mr. McNeil's house is sparse: He has a few pieces of furniture, mostly Danish, and simple rugs over the white oak floors. The focus is the art, which includes 14 major wall drawings by Sol LeWitt, 14 sculptures by Donald Judd and works by Carl Andre, Dan Flavin and Richard Tuttle. "People are really surprised when they come into my house. They're taken aback by the openness," says Mr. McNeil, who regularly hosts tours of museum board members from around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joan Wadleigh Curran opted for more of an industrial modern look when she turned three internally connected 19th-century carriage houses in the heart of Philadelphia's downtown into a 4,300-square-foot three bedroom home. An artist, Ms. Wadleigh Curran focused on keeping original details like the brick walls and unsealed concrete but added other natural materials like steel beams and an open, steel staircase to give it what she calls an "unfinished look."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The building has a feel of history to it. It's like life—there's a history to things but there's also the new. I wanted to keep that juxtaposition," says Ms. Wadleigh Curran, who bought the house for $907,000 in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Philadelphia, it makes sense to buy an old house: The city's housing stock is venerable, with a median year of construction of 1925. Besides, people love the way the old houses look. "You can get a very nice 2,500-square-foot Colonial, Queen Anne or Romanesque home in a beautiful, tree-lined neighborhood for $300,000 to $600,000," says Kevin Gillen , a senior research consultant at the Fels Institute of Government at the <span class="companylink">University of Pennsylvania</span> . "Since you would pay at least double that in other markets, the savings on the price can be used to undertake significant rehabs of the interior."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like a number of other cities, Philadelphia has also experienced an urban revitalization that is spurring greater interest in modern design. From 2006 through 2012, Philadelphia's population grew by 58,897 after falling for half a century, with 20- to 34-year-olds' share of the population up to 26% from 20%, according to Census estimates. Philadelphia also has a strong contemporary-design community, with seven college-level design programs as well as a number of new design-company startups and stores, that has influenced the type of interiors people want.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The city is getting more sophisticated, but people don't want to forget about its past," says Stefan Sklaroff, who just opened a 10,000-square-foot, two-level modern-furniture store called Cella Luxuria in a 19th-century brick building downtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet unlike design-friendly cities such as New York, Miami and Milan, Philadelphia loathes showiness, reflecting its Quaker heritage. The contrast between the staid exteriors and the vibrant interiors of homes is a metaphor for the city, says Val Nehez, an interior designer who works both out of Philadelphia and New York. "Philadelphia doesn't wear its style on its sleeve. It's behind closed doors. You have to be in the fabric of society—to enter into peoples' lives—to see it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone celebrates the demolition of details like wood moldings and stately fireplaces in favor of white Sheetrock, loftlike spaces and glass. While the interiors of homes are almost always up to the owners, Philadelphians aren't always shy about voicing their opinions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Cohen, whose recently remodeled home includes the blue fireplace and red sofa, admits she was shocked by some nasty comments that were posted when photos of her house appeared on an online forum. Commenters described the inside as a "circus horror story," "like a clown threw up" and "like a day care." Wrote one: "I don't hate modern design, but the total mismatch between exterior and interior is disturbing. Imagine it reversed, modern exterior/traditional interior. It's not right, is it?" In response, Ms. Cohen says she told her two daughters: "Day cares are bright and cheerful places, and I'm sure it's quite lovely when a clown vomits."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some owners try to merge the two sensibilities. It took art curator Eileen Tognini, 52, about 25 years—and her daughter moving out to go to college—before she and her husband finally turned the interior of their three-story, 2,500-square-foot Victorian 1882 brownstone in what's called the Fishtown neighborhood of Philadelphia into the contemporary design they'd long wanted. "Victorian has never been my sensibility, but I appreciated the bones," she says of the 10-month renovation, completed last June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result is very modern, particularly toward the back of the home: The dining room opens to the midcentury-modern and Japanese-influenced wood-and-steel kitchen, where double-panel cabinet doors are made from laser-cut steel and feature an abstract design modeled after a historic map of the neighborhood. There is a massive, wraparound glass staircase, and dropping down from the 24-foot-tall ceiling is a 12-foot-long "found art" light sculpture made by a local artist with steel rods and old trumpets, toy train tracks and parts of old pistons. But the couple decided to maintain the traditional feeling of the home's front rooms, retaining the original tile in the vestibule and the chestnut molding in the parlor. A Victorian mantle sits not too far from a second, newly installed glass-and-steel staircase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We felt really strongly it was important to preserve the history and not to assault that sensibility when you first walk in," Ms. Tognini says.</p>
