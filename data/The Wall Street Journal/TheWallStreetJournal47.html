<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Insider Sales Hit Record at Builders</span>
</div><div class="author">By Janet Morrissey Dow Jones Newswires </div><div>563 words</div><div>31 August 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C11</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insider selling at home-building companies has reached record levels during the past three quarters, making market experts wonder if investors should be selling, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Merrill Lynch quantitative analyst Richard Bernstein said he has seen record net insider selling during the past 10 months at eight of the 12 home-building companies he has tracked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This record level of selling comes despite the general perception that the stocks are undervalued, and despite that Wall Street analysts have few `sell' recommendations on the stocks," Mr. Bernstein said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He sees parallels between the housing sector and the technology industry before the bursting of the tech bubble. He said that within a year of the tech bubble's peak, about 14 of the 20 tech companies he tracked at the time reported record net insider sales and 16 of 20 within 18 months of the peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Raymond James analyst Rick Murray said the high level of insider selling among home builders just adds to concerns he has already had about the industry, though he said the reasons behind the selling could vary from executive to executive and builder to builder. "It's hard to see the detail of the sale to know whether or not somebody was exercising options that were near expiration or if they were outright selling or what other kinds of motivations could be there," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He already has a cautious view of the sector based on fundamentals, and expressed concern about the surge in speculative buying and building. Although there's been talk about speculation in hot markets, such as Florida, California, Arizona and Nevada, he believes the problem could be even more widespread.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Carliner, vice president of economics at the National Association of Home Builders, noted that his studies have shown that housing prices have risen at a faster pace than median household incomes. He said homes are at their least affordable level in at least 30 years. Median prices for new homes are now about five times median household incomes, which is substantially higher than 1975, when new home prices were 3.3 times household incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ron Muhlenkamp, portfolio manager at Muhlenkamp &amp;Co. Inc., which invests in six home builders, said he isn't overly concerned about insider selling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I have never found one reason that overwhelms all the others" as reason to sell, he said. "We're happy with the home builders we own . . . and [we have] no current plans to sell them," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">UBS analyst Margaret Whelan dismisses concerns about insider selling. "Most of these companies are first and second generation" companies, where founders or their families hold a substantial percentage stake in the companies, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The founders of the builders own more equity as a percentage of their companies than most other CEOs or founders of big S&amp;P 500 companies," she said. As an example, she noted that Robert and Bruce Toll, who founded Toll Brothers Inc., hold more than 30% of their company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Merrill Lynch's Mr. Bernstein said, "We think there is a strong contrary message to investors if the stocks have appreciated so much that executives across nearly the entire industry feel the need to diversify at record pace." </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO -- One recent summer day, would-be home buyers crowd into a one-bedroom condominium in San Francisco's South of Market neighborhood, eager for the chance to pay $295,000 for an apartment measuring less than 600 square feet, parking not included.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite its small size and less-than-lovely location, the cozy apartment is brand-new, and by local standards a steal: A similar unit in the same building is offered at $479,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But to get into this low-priced home, buyers must leave their fate to a roll of the dice. Or, more precisely, the pulling of their name out of the proverbial hat. Here, in the land of the $726,900 median-priced home, people earning an average income must either remain renters, call on more-affluent family members for help, or vie to buy at below-market prices through city programs aimed at first-time buyers. The last choice attracts far more people than there are units available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's no question that the demand far outstrips the supply of these programs. I'd be reluctant to even put a number on by how much," says Matt Franklin, director of the Mayor's Office of Housing, which administers the city's various first-time homebuyer programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median-priced home in the San Francisco Bay Area cost 12% more in the second quarter than it had a year earlier, the National Association of Realtors reports, which according to Mr. Franklin means only about 12% of San Francisco households can afford it, assuming they devote 30% of income to housing costs. (Of course, in some markets these days, homeowners are devoting as much as 50% of income toward housing.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Francisco isn't alone. The median starter home cost $177,200 in the second quarter, and assuming a 10% down payment, the typical first-time home buyer could afford one costing about 70% as much -- $124,200, according to the Realtors association. That is 70% of the income needed to buy an average starter home in the second quarter, down from about 77% in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So cities nationwide have instituted various programs for first-time home buyers, including the lotteries and second loans that don't have to be paid until the unit is sold. In San Francisco, the system for allocating below-market-rate units used to be first-come, first-served, but that led to some desperate measures when homes became available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There were some bad experiences with folks camping out for three days to be in line," the city's Mr. Franklin says. "The old system was almost a survival of the fittest." With the lottery, "we've brought more consistency."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lottery winners must live in the unit rather than rent it out, and when they sell, the price is dictated by a city formula based on median income for the metropolitan area, as calculated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So owners of below-market-rate units in recent years didn't get all of the astronomical price gains enjoyed by other San Francisco homeowners who have sold recently. The median home price in the Bay Area rose 40% in the three years ending in the second quarter, far outstripping incomes. But Lori Bamberger, deputy director of San Francisco's Mayor's Office of Housing, notes that they weren't locked out of profits entirely. A family of three with a household income of as much as $58,000 in 1997 -- the median income in the metro area that year -- could have bought a two-bedroom below-market-rate unit for $186,771. If they sold today, the city formula would put the price at $325,488, based on the latest median income of $85,500. Our family would have gained 74% over the period, or about $139,000. (And the gains ensue no matter which direction home values head in the broader market -- though of course, if median income doesn't move, as it didn't between 2004 and 2005, neither does the price of the below-market home.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For other city programs, homeowners pay a portion of any gain to the city when they sell. For instance, under the City Second Loan, if the eligible buyer receives a second loan valued at, say, 20% of the home's value, then the buyer must pay 20% of any gain to the city when they sell the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city helps about 250 to 300 home buyers a year through various programs, Mr. Franklin estimates. He wouldn't venture a guess as to how many apply but are turned down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the recent lottery for the South of Market condo, after more than 100 people walk through the apartment, only 11 fill out the necessary applications -- one to prequalify for a loan and one for the city program -- to be entered in the lottery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And on lottery day, only one applicant shows up at the condo to watch the drawing in person. The 40-something woman said this was her fourth lottery attempt since prequalifying for a loan seven months ago. Her name has been drawn as high as No. 2 on the list -- if the winner that time had failed to get a loan, the home would have been hers. But that didn't happen. And this time, her name comes up seventh.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO -- One recent summer day, would-be home buyers crowd into a one-bedroom condominium in San Francisco's South of Market neighborhood, eager for the chance to pay $295,000 (241,280 euros) for an apartment measuring less than 54 square meters, parking not included.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite its small size and less-than-lovely location, the cozy apartment is brand-new, and by local standards a steal: A similar unit in the same building is offered at $479,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But to get into this low-price home, buyers must leave their fate to a roll of the dice. Or, more precisely, the pulling of their name out of the proverbial hat. Here, in the land of the $726,900 median-price home, people earning an average income must either remain renters, call on more-affluent family members for help, or vie to buy at below-market prices through city programs aimed at first-time buyers. The last choice attracts far more people than there are units available.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's no question that the demand far outstrips the supply of these programs. I'd be reluctant to even put a number on by how much," says Matt Franklin, director of the Mayor's Office of Housing, which administers the city's various first-time-buyer programs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median-price home in the San Francisco Bay Area cost 12% more in the second quarter than it had a year earlier, the National Association of Realtors reports, which according to Mr. Franklin means only about 12% of San Francisco households can afford it, assuming they devote 30% of income to housing costs. (Of course, in some markets, homeowners are devoting as much as 50% of income toward housing.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median starter home in San Francisco cost $177,200 in the second quarter, and assuming a 10% down payment, the typical first-time home buyer could afford one costing about 70% as much -- $124,200, according to the Realtors association. That is 70% of the income needed to buy an average starter home in the second quarter, down from about 77% in the first quarter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So cities across the U.S. have instituted various programs for first-time home buyers, including the lotteries and second loans that don't have to be paid until the unit is sold. In San Francisco, the system for allocating below-market-rate units used to be first-come, first-served, but that led to some desperate measures when homes became available.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There were some bad experiences with folks camping out for three days to be in line," Mr. Franklin says. "The old system was almost a survival of the fittest." With the lottery, "we've brought more consistency."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lottery winners must live in the unit rather than rent it out, and when they sell, the price is dictated by a city formula based on median income for the metropolitan area, as calculated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means owners of below-market-rate units in recent years didn't get all of the astronomical price gains enjoyed by other San Francisco homeowners who have sold recently. The median home price in the Bay Area rose 40% in the three years ending in the second quarter, far outstripping incomes. But Lori Bamberger, deputy director of San Francisco's Mayor's Office of Housing, notes that they weren't locked out of profits entirely. A family of three with a household income of as much as $58,000 in 1997 -- the median income in the metro area that year -- could have bought a two-bedroom below-market-rate unit for $186,771. If they sold today, the city formula would put the price at $325,488, based on the latest median income of $85,500. The family would have gained 74% over the period, or about $139,000. (And the gains ensue no matter which direction home values head in the broader market -- though of course, if median income doesn't move, as it didn't between 2004 and 2005, neither does the price of the below-market home.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city helps about 250 to 300 home buyers a year through various programs, Mr. Franklin estimates. He wouldn't venture a guess as to how many apply but are turned down.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the recent lottery for the South of Market condo, after more than 100 people walk through the apartment, only 11 fill out the necessary applications -- one to prequalify for a loan and one for the city program -- to be entered in the lottery.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And on lottery day, only one applicant shows up at the condo to watch the drawing in person. The 40-something woman said this was her fourth lottery attempt since prequalifying for a loan seven months ago. Her name has been drawn as high as No. 2 on the list -- if the winner that time had failed to get a loan, the home would have been hers. But that didn't happen. And this time, her name comes up seventh.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maj. Joe Leahy[http://www.darnews.com/articles/2005/08/15/news/news17.txttarget=_blank] is a civil engineer with the U.S. Army's Engineer Brigade. He has been stationed at Camp Victory, outside of Baghdad, since November 2004--enough time to get frustrated. "We all know it's a dangerous place," he says. "But the thing that I want people to understand is that they only see those one or two instances in the country that are negative. You don't really hear about the 100 things that have gone good."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He adds, "One thing we've got to understand is that it's not going to happen tomorrow, but we are doing something that's getting better every day."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leahy's good-bad ratio may be debatable, but many servicemen and their families and friends back home, not to mention the general public, have been getting frustrated lately with the media coverage of Iraq--enough so to cause some limited, though still welcome, soul-searching[http://tampatrib.com/opinion/MGBQKJP0MCE.htmltarget=_blank] among major media outlets. Whether the coverage will improve as a result remains to be seen. In the meantime, here are the past two weeks' worth of stories, some of which you might have missed.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Angered by Shiite calls for a federal region, Sunni clerics urged followers . . . to vote against the constitution if it contains measures they believe would divide the country. . . .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iraq's three major Sunni organizations appeared to have taken a united stand both for voting and against demands for federalism after they boycotted the Jan. 30 parliamentary elections. . . .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sheik Mahmoud al-Sumaidaie, of the influential Sunni Association of Muslim Scholars, told worshippers at Baghdad's Umm al-Qura mosque to register for the upcoming votes because "we are in need to your voice to say 'yes' for the constitution or 'no.' " Such voices are growing louder[http://www.almendhar.com/english_5304/news.aspxtarget=_blank] and increasingly representative of the whole Sunni community:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The general conference of Sunnis in Iraq, which includes "the Sunni Mortmain," "the Association of Muslim Scholars," "the Iraqi Islamic Party," and a group of Sunni parties and organizations, was held in Baghdad and has urged all Arab Sunnis to participate in the coming elections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his speech before hundreds of attendees, Ahmed Abdel Ghafur Al Samera'i said, "Participating in the plebiscite on the constitution is a prescribed duty for all Sunnis."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added, "I swear to Allah that the greatest privilege, through which you gain the love of Allah, is your efforts in participating in the coming elections and gathering the Sunnis, hoping that Allah would alleviate their suffering."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alaa Maki, member of the political bureau in the "Iraqi Islamic Party," has confirmed, "The party has suggested the provision of cities of Sunni majority with additional lists, so that everyone would be able to register their information in the electors and plebiscite on the permanent constitution records."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added, "We would enter the elections with a heavier weight than some people imagine. We would continue in participating in the political process side by side with the constituents of the Iraqi people." He referred to the existence of some misunderstanding among the political blocs, with regard to the elections' law and the mechanism of executing them. He called all Imams and preachers to direct and urge people to participate in the plebiscite on the permanent constitution and participate in the coming elections. Check out the flier[http://iraqthemodel.blogspot.com/2005/08/yesterday-in-afternoon-i-picked-up.htmltarget=_blank] the Islamic Party, is distributing, which aims to convince Sunnis that voting is a religious duty. What a difference a few months can make.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's also a change of mind[http://www.iwpr.net/archive/ipm/ipm_304.htmltarget=_blank] in this former trouble spot:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After boycotting the previous elections, Falluja is preparing to participate in the referendum on the constitution. Falluja's clerics council advised the Imams of the mosques and the people not to miss this historical chance and to take part in it through the four centers opened there. Community leaders and clerics organized lectures to educate the people about the importance of their participation and that the constitution is for the interests of all Iraqis, which will decide their identities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's more from Fallujah[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-08/19/content_3375351.htmtarget=_blank]:</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Fallujah, considered one of the major hotbed of Iraqi insurgency, clerics of mosques called on the residents in the city to participate in the constitution referendum scheduled to be held in mid October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They urged the residents through loudspeakers to participate and say "no" to those who want to isolate them from the political process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Iraqi Islamic Party, the largest Sunni party, also distributed handouts calling on the people to participate the referendum. Many of the residents showed support and desire to participate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I want to participate and I call on the people of the city to do so because we do not want to let those who came from the other side of the border to rule us again," said Mohammed Uthman, a government employee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If we don't participate this time, it means we let the present government to continue, and thus the real ruler would be the Iranians and not the Iraqis," he added. Four registration centers[http://www.almendhar.com/english_5381/news.aspxtarget=_blank] have been opened in Fallujah.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main Sunni terror group, Ansar Al Sunna, and the Shiite radical Muqtada al-Sadr have both been calling on supporters to register[http://www.adnki.com/index_2Level.php?cat=Politics&amp;loid=8.0.199451272&amp;par=0] to vote in the constitution referendum:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[One] statement issued by six of the seven Ansar groups promised that there will not be attacks against Americans on the day of the referendum, "to protect those who go to vote." "Voting is a jihad of words and is no different from the jihad of the sword," the statement said. 'There are no objections to participation in the referendum to show the world our strength and to defeat federalism."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Registration[http://www.almendhar.com/english_5556/news.aspxtarget=_blank] is now in full swing:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Independent Supreme Commission for Elections has announced launching more than 500 centers for registering electors in all Iraqi cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Farid Ayar, member of the commission council said in a statement, "There are543 centers all over Iraq, of which 517 are currently working regularly." He pointed out, "The necessary protection has been provided for the working centers. There are 26 closed centers at present, due to the lack of sufficient security protection."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Agency for International Development has been helping to bring the constitutional debate to the people[http://www.reliefweb.int/library/documents/2005/usaid-irq-11aug.pdftarget=_blank] (link in PDF):</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Constitutional Dialogue program has organized over 3,000 dialogues throughout Iraq, reaching almost 80,000 Iraqis who also shared their opinions through 64,000 questionnaires. To date, 210 nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have participated, including 151 NGOs contracted by USAID and 59 NGOs working as volunteers. Feedback indicates that the dialogues are achieving their dual purpose; to educate and consult the public.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">USAID's Local Governance Program (LGP) is promoting the organization of Local Government Associations (LGAs) throughout Iraq. The LGAs will act as lobbying and advocacy organizations to represent the interests of the local government without having any authority to direct their operations. Recent activities included:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* A training session on the role of LGAs for 23 new members of an LGA in Babil Governorate. LGA members met with the local INA office to explain the role of LGAs and to present a list of issues related to local government.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even a year ago, the dusty, rolling hills north of Kirkuk were largely barren. But the horizon has changed rapidly in recent months with a flurry of newly constructed cinder block homes dotting the hillsides.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thousands of returning Kurds have transformed pockets of land around Kirkuk into small settlements--leading to the rebirth of villages once emptied out by former dictator Saddam Hussein under his "Arabization" plan to force out ethnic Kurds and Turkomen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this village, 15 miles northeast of Kirkuk, hundreds of new houses have sprouted since January because the flow of displaced Kurds returning to the area has grown steadily since the U.S.-led ouster of Saddam in 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are starting from the beginning again," Mayor Abdul Samad Rahim Karim said. "God willing, we will succeed in making Shwan better than before."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The returnees are a legacy from Saddam's era, when the Ba'athist Party forcibly expelled tens of thousands of Kurds and Turkomen and replaced them with Arabs from the south to consolidate government control over oil resources and farmlands located in northern Iraq.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other places, the Kurds' return, many to squatter camps around the city, and their demands for restoration of their property have provoked sharp protests from many Arabs as well as Turkomen in the community.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The call-in portion, initially a novelty, has become a staple of the show, and panelists field up to 30 calls per segment, Mohammed said. And because Kirkuk is ethnically mixed, the show switches among the languages spoken by Kurds, Arabs, Turkomen or Assyrians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It took Iraqis a while to master the art of the phone-in.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Task Force 1-163 Infantry, some villagers may not see health care professionals for years at a time, making it tough on the community and particularly the young.

Iraqi and U.S. government agencies announced Aug. 6 that renovations of 43 schools in the northern and southern provinces are funded for repairs, and contracts have been awarded for the work. As part of the Iraq Relief Reconstruction Fund, over $1.3M was set aside to continue a nationwide school repair program that addresses rehabilitating sanitary facilities, electrical and mechanical systems, and structural repairs to schools in Karbala, Dahuk, Najaf, Basrah, and Qadisiyah.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jeff Bater Dow Jones Newswires  </div><div>405 words</div><div>25 August 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Orders for big-ticket factory goods dropped sharply in July, marring what had been an upbeat picture of third-quarter U.S. economic growth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surprise drop is reminiscent of other recent periods when high energy prices pushed the economy into a soft spot. Still, economists said it is too soon to say the economy has weakened. Separately, and on a positive side, the government said sales of new homes broke another record in July.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for durable goods, those products expected to last at least three years, tumbled 4.9% in July to $204.71 billion (167.39 billion euros) from June, the Commerce Department said yesterday, far more than economists expected.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Manufacturing definitely hit an air pocket in July because the weakness goes beyond commercial aircraft," said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics in Pepper Pike, Ohio.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders fell 5.9% for computers and electronics, 6.2% for machinery, 2% for electrical equipment and 8.6% for transportation goods, as an increase for motor-vehicle bookings was offset by plunging aircraft demand. Primary metals orders rose 1.1%, but fabricated metals fell 4.4%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The unexpected weakness might mean the recent rebound in energy prices made companies more cautious again, but it's probably too early to know if this is the start of a new soft period in the manufacturing sector," said Patrick Fearon, an economist at A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons in St. Louis, Missouri. "It could be just a one-month blip."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other indicators are pointing up. A previously released report by the private Institute for Supply Management suggested manufacturing activity accelerated in July. The decrease in orders for durable goods followed three months of increases. And while a key barometer of business spending -- orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft -- decreased 3.7% in July, it rose 4.8% in June.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some may see the drop in orders as "a sign that the economy may be starting to sag under the weight of higher oil prices," the strength of orders in May and June and the strong ISM report still point to a "rebound in manufacturing activity in the third quarter," RBS Greenwich Capital Markets economist Michelle Girard said.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of existing homes retreated in July from June's record highs and the stockpile of unsold homes rose, a hint that the still-strong residential real-estate market may be starting to lose some of its vigor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes dropped 2.6% in July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 7.16 million units, down from 7.35 million in June. The decline was the largest one-month drop in 18 months, but the July figure was still the third-highest on record and 4.7% above the July 2004 pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condominium sales slid 5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 915,000 units, the first setback since February for a segment that has outpaced other housing types this year. Single-family home sales fell 2.3% to a rate of 6.24 million per year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The retreat was particularly noticeable in the West, a high-priced area that has fueled the market's expansion in recent months. Sales in the region dropped 7.5% from June, spurred by a 13% decline in condo sales. Overall sales were down 3.3% in the Northeast, 1.8% in the Midwest and unchanged in the South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the fall in sales, the median price of homes rose to $218,000, a robust 14.1% higher than last year. The median price -- the figure at which half sold for more and half sold for less -- decreased 1% for condos to $219,300, but rose 0.5% for single-family homes to $217,900.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists have been searching for signs that the housing market is beginning to cool. Some saw the new data as another sign of the beginning of a broader slackening. "I think it signals a slowing," said Nicolas Retsinas, director of Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies. David Lereah, the Realtors association's chief economist, characterized it as a reasonable decline in light of recent highs and said low mortgage rates will continue to aid builders. "It's still a seller's market," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors survey found an upturn in inventories of unsold houses, a phenomenon that could apply downward pressure on prices and new construction. Total housing inventory levels rose 2.6% in July to 2.75 million homes, the equivalent of a 4.6-month supply of unsold homes. While low by historic standards, it is the highest since November 2003. For condos, inventory shot up to a 5.3-month supply, a 29% jump from June and the highest rate since the survey has tracked the figure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All of the sudden, condo inventories are starting to build a little," Mr. Lereah said. "We may be seeing a little sign there that air is starting to come out of the condo balloon."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors survey is drawn from a large sample of closings on the sale of existing homes, and reflects purchase decisions made in the spring. The organization also has begun to report pending sales; that report is due Sept. 1. The government publishes a separate tally on the construction and sale of new houses. </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. fell 2.6% in July as mortgage rates increased, but even with the decline, sales clocked in at the third-highest level on record.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said yesterday that home resales fell to a 7.16 million annual rate last month from June's revised 7.35 million annual pace. June sales were originally seen at a rate of 7.33 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price -- where half sold for more and half sold for less -- of an existing home was $218,000 in July, up 14% from a year earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices have surged an average of about 50% in the U.S. in the past five years, thanks largely to the lowest mortgage-interest rates in more than four decades and what has been a shortage of available homes in many markets. Some economists and housing-industry analysts believe supply is catching up with demand -- a trend that could cause home-price appreciation to slow in the months ahead.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, the inventory of homes available for sale rose, which the association's chief economist, David Lereah, said could take some pressure off prices. The inventory of homes on the market rose to 4.6 months last month, compared with June's revised 4.4 months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Strong demand continues to entice more sellers into the market," economists at Nomura Securities International wrote in a research note. "However, when home-price appreciation begins to slow -- as it inevitably will -- we suspect the number of homes on the market will also fall as fewer homeowners test the waters in a hot market."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By region, sales were down in all parts of the U.S., except for the South, where they were flat. Demand was down 3.3% in the Northeast, 1.8% in the Midwest and 7.5% in the West.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overall decline in sales of previously owned homes came as mortgage rates rose. The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage in July was 5.7%, up from 5.58% in June. Even with the increase, though, mortgage rates still are considered low by historical standards.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Today's Market Forecast]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shakier Foundation</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">America's housing boom got a little less loud last month. But don't take the earplugs out just yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors will issue its July report on existing-home sales today, and many Wall Street economists expect that it will show the U.S. real-estate market came off its record June pace. The trade group's index of pending sales, which leads existing-home sales by a couple of months, has declined from its April high. Summer tends to be a slow time of year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It isn't hard to find signs that the real-estate market is cooling. Lumber prices have been falling, mortgage applications have been down and the inventory of homes available for sale has been rising in some of the country's hottest markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem, says Lehman Brothers economist Joe Abate, is that it always is going to be possible to find such signs -- and right now, with so much attention focused on the U.S. housing market, there are plenty of people looking. Mr. Abate, who estimates that July's existing-home sales fell to an annualized 7.2 million homes from June's 7.33 million pace, thinks that when real estate stumbles for real, it will be easy to tell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You'll know it when the housing market is going to pop," he says. "I can't define it, but you'll know it when it's popping."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traders aren't as willing to wait for clear signs of a housing slowdown as Mr. Abate is, however. They lately have been pushing down the shares not just of homebuilders, but of companies whose sales are seen as dependent on a strong real-estate market. The stock of upscale home-furniture and kitchenware retailer Williams-Sonoma, which reports today, has fallen 7.8% this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason Wall Street started worrying about Williams-Sonoma: When the Commerce Department reported disappointing July retail sales figures this month, furniture and home-furnishings stores were particularly soft. That suggested bad news for Williams-Sonoma's Pottery Barn stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although furniture sales match up well with home sales over time, from month to month they can be choppy. That sales of furnishings fell in July may have had less to do with housing than with would-be shoppers at places like Pottery Barn opting to not lug a new couch home in record heat.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAN ECONOMICS save you from losing your shirt in the housing market?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spurred on by the growing concern that America's residential real-estate market is heading for a downturn, a number of top economists are producing lists that rank the metropolitan areas most likely to suffer a drop in housing prices. The problem is that these studies, which look at factors from local income to lending practices, come to strikingly different conclusions. Even so, the raft of data can provide useful clues for home buyers and investors wary of getting in at the top.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists at PMI Mortgage Insurance Co., a unit of PMI Group Inc., for instance, recently calculated that the Boston area faces the greatest risk of a drop in housing prices among 50 U.S. cities they analyzed. But Boston doesn't even make the top 10 in lists of potentially overpriced markets compiled by researchers at mortgage lender National City Corp. and investment bank Credit Suisse First Boston, a unit of Credit Suisse Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The PMI ranking puts the New York area at No. 14 on a list of frothy places. But National City ranks the Big Apple at a mere 68 out of 299 metro areas -- below such places as Flint, Mich., and Duluth, Minn. National City isn't claiming that Flint is pricier than New York, of course, but says Flint appears more overvalued in terms of supply-and-demand fundamentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No national study can take into account all of the factors that affect house prices, or determine whether a particular home or neighborhood is dangerously overpriced or a screaming bargain. Such assessments require the expertise of people in the local market. But the rankings do highlight certain cities and regions where buyers may want to be more cautious than usual. That's particularly true in the cases where the studies agree: The PMI, National City and CSFB rankings differ markedly -- but all include the Riverside-San Bernardino, Calif., as an area where prices may drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fueled by the lowest interest rates in four decades, the nation is into its fifth year of a housing boom that has seen home prices appreciate an average of 50% and a growing number of people speculating in real estate. That's generating mounting concern the market will slump, harming the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economists who churn out these rankings come to different conclusions for a good reason: They use different methods. One common technique is to compare the monthly costs of buying a house to rents. Because people can choose to buy or rent, the two costs shouldn't get too far out of whack. Rents also represent the earnings potential of a home, so the ratio of home prices to rents is akin to the price/earnings ratio used by stock investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edward Leamer, an economics professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, compared median 2004 home prices to the typical annual rent of a 1,500-square-foot apartment in various cities. He found that this price/rent ratio had risen fastest since 2000 in West Palm Beach, Fla.; Orange County, Calif.; and the San Francisco area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Leamer acknowledges the flaws in such an analysis. For one thing, apartments aren't exactly the same as single-family homes. And the low interest rates that have allowed more people to buy homes also depress demand for apartments, pushing up the ratio. Even so, the ratio helps to identify places where prices may have risen too fast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another method is to compare house prices with local incomes to see how affordable houses are. Michael D. Youngblood, an economist at the Arlington, Va., investment-banking firm Friedman, Billings, Ramsey &amp;Co., studies the ratio of median house prices to personal incomes per capita. Based on that ratio, he recently found that Santa Barbara, Salinas and Santa Cruz, all in California, were the nation's least-affordable housing markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he says prices in those cities and some others are unlikely to decline significantly because of severe shortages of space and regulatory barriers to housing construction. Those constraints make these markets "dysfunctional," Mr. Youngblood says. Los Angeles also has a relatively high house-price/income ratio but fewer barriers to construction than the dysfunctional markets, he says. As a result, he thinks the "bubble" in Los Angeles wouldn't begin to deflate before the city experiences at least 12 months of decline in economic output.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others toss more complicated blends of data into their computers. Richard J. DeKaser, chief economist at National City, examines the ratio of home prices to household incomes in metro areas and tries to explain the variation in these ratios on the basis of population density (a proxy for shortages of space), relative income levels, mortgage rates and historically observed differences in prices. (Those differences, he says, reflect such things as climate, schools and cultural attractions.) Based on that data, he estimates what house prices should be and compares those estimates with actual prices to determine whether a market is over- or undervalued. Mr. DeKaser dubs his method "multivariate pooled time series analysis."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. DeKaser found that as of this year's first quarter, 53 metropolitan areas -- accounting for 31% of the total U.S. housing market -- were "extremely overvalued and confront a high risk of future price correction." The New York area (including three New Jersey counties) didn't fall into that category, though the nearby Nassau-Suffolk suburbs did. Santa Barbara, Calif., topped National City's list.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For its "risk index," CSFB looked at the popularity of interest-only loans in various cities -- a sign that buyers are stretching themselves to afford homes -- as well as the rate of price increases and the level of purchasing by investors. Interest-only loans, often used to help people buy homes they otherwise couldn't afford, allow borrowers to delay the repayment of principal for typically five years. CSFB then mixed in job growth and factors such as zoning laws that limit supply. "You have to encompass all the pieces that drive the market," says Ivy L. Zelman, a housing analyst at CSFB.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PMI won't open up the black box on its proprietary model but says it involves such factors as the labor market, local incomes and mortgage payments. Nor does the mortgage-insurance company offer any specific advice for people wondering whether to buy homes in such risky areas as Boston. "It really depends on somebody's risk preferences," explains Marco van Akkeren, an economist at PMI.</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty  </div><div>910 words</div><div>22 August 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>A5B</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When America's housing boom finally ends, don't expect a loud pop.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not going to be a big dramatic event," says William Apgar, senior scholar at Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike stock prices, the housing market can't collapse in a few days. People can dump their stocks almost instantly, but it often takes months to sell a house.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In past housing busts in California, New England and elsewhere, many owners who couldn't get what they considered a reasonable price yanked their houses off the market. The number of transactions plunged but prices fell only gradually, often over several years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, that is little reassurance for Americans who are worried that they bought at the top of the market or for those waiting for prices to ease before jumping in. And the end of the boom is likely to be painful for many people. Among the most vulnerable: people who might have to sell in a weak market because of a job loss or transfer; those with little or no equity in their homes and big mortgages; and those counting on big gains in home equity to make up for a lack of retirement savings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing boom has been an enormous boost to the economy, spurring construction, increasing the net worth of millions of families and allowing Americans to borrow against the rising value of their homes. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com, a forecasting firm in West Chester, Pennsylvania, says the housing surge accounts for nearly 40% of the four million jobs created by the U.S. economy over the past two years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists disagree about how much damage a housing downturn would inflict on the economy. Mr. Zandi hopes that strong job growth in other parts of the economy will cushion any blow from housing. But, he says, the risks of harm to the economy will grow if house prices keep surging for another year or two.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Predictions that the housing market would falter soon have proved premature repeatedly. Still, many economists believe the boom is now peaking or will do so within a year or so. Few predict a sharp fall in prices nationwide, but many economists expect prices to decline at least modestly in some of the cities along the East and West coasts, where buying has been most frenzied.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market has been unusually hot for the past five years largely because low interest rates have allowed Americans to borrow and spend more. The National Association of Realtors forecasts that sales of new and previously owned homes in the U.S. will total 8.2 million in 2005, setting a record for the fifth year in a row. That would be nearly twice the 4.2 million sales recorded in 1995.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the five years through June, the nation's median house price grew at an inflation-adjusted average annual rate of 4.9%, according to the Realtors. That is triple the annual average since the real-estate trade group began compiling the data in 1968. In some places, the rise has been far greater. The median price (not adjusted for inflation) shot up 47% to $243,400 in the Phoenix area over the past 12 months, the Realtors say.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How bad could the next downturn be? Optimists say that the pace of price increases will merely slow to a more sustainable level. Many economists say past drops in house prices have been recorded only in places where lots of jobs have been lost. One example is Los Angeles, hit by a rapid shrinkage of the aerospace industry during the early 1990s. In cities with strong job markets, home prices have tended to keep rising, albeit at a slower rate, when the market cooled.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, history shows that house-price declines are less rare than many Realtors suggest. Richard J. DeKaser, chief economist at National City Corp., a Cleveland-based banking concern, recently studied home prices in 299 metropolitan areas over the past 20 years. He found that 63 of them at some point suffered declines of 10% or more over periods of at least two years. The worst hit was Lafayette, Louisiana, where prices fell 39% in the late 1980s amid a slump in the oil industry. The median decline in those 63 markets was 17%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The end of the boom isn't likely to cause a recession, however, says Mr. DeKaser of National City. He expects prices to erode in some overheated markets. But because the housing market depends so much on local conditions, prices probably will continue to rise in some places as they fall in others, diluting the effect on the national economy, he says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unless interest rates rise much more sharply than expected, there is no reason to expect a national housing crash, says Allen Sinai, chief global economist at Decision Economics Inc. in Boston. "I don't think this is a situation of boom-bust," he says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Edward Leamer, an economics professor at the University of California Los Angeles, says a housing downturn could "kick the economy into slow growth and possibly an outright recession." He counts 10 declines in residential investment since World War II. Eight of them, he says, provided the early warnings for recessions.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By Jon E. Hilsenrath and James R. Hagerty  </div><div>1143 words</div><div>22 August 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>A5B</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks promote exotic mortgages, tiny apartments sell for outrageous prices, and regulators worry about loose lending standards.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. in 2005? No, Japan in the early 1990s, when banks helped people purchase increasingly expensive homes by, among other things, issuing 100-year mortgages that were meant to be paid off by later generations. Japanese authorities halted the boom by raising interest rates and tightening lending standards -- ushering in a long, slow property decline.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are plenty of differences between Japan then and the U.S. today. But a search through boom-bust cycles of the past offers lessons about today's real-estate boom in the U.S. and how it might play out.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People who have studied past busts point to two main causes: a drying up of liquidity -- often through tighter lending standards or higher interest rates -- or a serious economic shock, like an oil or currency crisis.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property booms themselves don't guarantee a bust. In a study of housing booms in 14 advanced economies during the past 35 years, the International Monetary Fund found that at least a third didn't bust. But in countries experiencing a nationwide real-estate bust, the consequences can be drawn out and severe. All but one have been associated with recessions, and many have been tied to banking crises as well.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"History can tell you how bad things can get and can give you some ideas about some of the causes of what happened," says Michael Bordo, a professor of economic history at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are some important signposts:  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">`REFUSE TO LOSE': People often act irrationally when housing markets go sour.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From 1982 to 1989, condominium prices in Boston nearly tripled. Then demand dried up. But rather than cut asking prices, many owners decided to sit tight and hope. By 1992, fewer than 30% of Boston condos sold within six months, while hundreds languished at prices few buyers were willing to pay.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christopher Mayer, a Columbia University economist who studied the Boston boom and bust, found that through the early stages of the downturn, people had a strong resistance to selling at a loss, even if such a sale would have freed them to buy another house in the same market on the cheap.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Psychology is impairing their ability to make good economic decisions," Prof. Mayer says. Economists call this "loss aversion" -- people are much more unwilling to face reality and sell losers than they are to sell winners. He says it is the key factor that makes real-estate markets so slow to adjust in a downturn.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Refusing to sell at a loss is the main reason people freeze up. Others can't afford to sell: Their mortgage balances are higher than the price they could get.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is what happened to Kathryn McMiller. People were camping out to be first in line for new homes when she bought a $130,000, or about 107,000 euros, condo in Trabuco Canyon, California, in 1991. Her plan was to sell the condo after a few years at a big profit so she could afford a bigger home with a yard.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shortly after her purchase, however, prices began declining. Within a few years, some condos identical to hers were going for $90,000. "I couldn't afford to sell," Ms. McMiller says. The proceeds wouldn't have covered the amount she owed on her mortgage. So she stayed put until 1999, when the market recovered enough for her to sell for about the same price she paid in 1991.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOLLOW THE MONEY: To understand a boom, you need to understand its enablers. In property booms, it tends to be the banks.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Susan Wachter and Richard Herring, economists at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, say bankers in the past have tended to suffer from "disaster myopia," an inability to envision worst-case scenarios during long stretches of good times. That encourages them to loosen lending standards.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Japan's long economic boom provided fuel for jusen, specialized home lenders such as Nippon Housing Loan Co., creator of the 100-year mortgage. "There needs to be fuel for a boom, and banks historically provided that fuel," Prof. Wachter says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S. today, banks are selling increasingly exotic mortgages. But the key difference is they don't hold the loans; instead, many sell them off to investors as bonds. That does protect individual banks, but it could spread the risk throughout the financial system.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOCATION. LOCATION. LOCATION: As homeowners in Cleveland and Dallas will tell you, there is no housing bubble in many parts of the country. On a scale much smaller than the U.S., something similar was true in Hong Kong a decade ago: Average prices soared 61% from 1995 to 1997. But even though Hong Kong is just a few times the size of Washington, price increases varied widely, ranging from 28% in some buildings to 248% in others.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Grace Wong, a professor at the Wharton School's Zell/Lurie Real Estate Center, found that as Hong Kong's handover to China approached, districts with more pro-China leanings faced less political uncertainty and thus less market speculation, resulting in more modest price increases.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A study of regional U.S. housing bubbles by Friedman, Billings, Ramsey &amp; Co., an Arlington, Virginia, brokerage firm, found that in the period from 1987 to 1994, bubbles in 42 metropolitan areas lasted anywhere from one to 31 quarters. Median house prices subsequently fell by as much as 39%, but in some areas they didn't fall at all. "It is striking that the durations of bubbles and the magnitudes of the subsequent declines in house prices vary so widely," Michael Youngblood, the author of the report, said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE DOG THAT DIDN'T BARK: Not all booms end in a housing bust.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Declining oil prices shocked the Texas economy in the 1980s, and defense cutbacks in Southern California hurt the Los Angeles job base in the early 1990s, causing nasty housing busts in both cases. So when the technology bubble burst in 2000, home prices in the tech-dependent San Francisco Bay area seemed primed to fall. But they haven't. Five years after the bust, the median sales prices of existing San Francisco homes were 41% higher -- at $641,700.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house-price bubbles that Friedman Billings Ramsey found from 1987 to 1994 ranged from Boston to Tallahassee, Florida, to Tucson, Arizona. But in 14 markets, the bubbles never burst, including in many of today's frothy markets, such as San Diego, Santa Barbara, and San Jose, in California.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NORTH POTOMAC, Maryland -- After seeing his neighbors sell their high-priced homes in just a few days two months ago, Brian Rabin expected a similar experience when he put his family's three-bedroom townhouse in Gaithersburg, Maryland, on the market in mid-July.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after almost a month -- and after lowering the asking price by $30,000 (25,000 euros), to $649,000 -- he had not a single offer. He decided last Monday to take it off the market temporarily. "We are finding it frustrating," he said. "We were hoping to sell quickly, but so far that hasn't happened."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From Boston to San Diego to Washington, there are signs that the red-hot U.S.housing market may be cooling. The number of listings is up, sales are down and more sellers are being forced to trim prices or offer incentives to entice buyers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agents say it appears that prices have become so high that more potential buyers are being squeezed out of the market. Buy-and-flip investors, who often purchase homes before they are built and resell them for a tidy profit after construction is completed, are cashing out early -- in some cases before the house is finished. Families who can still afford the high prices are postponing their purchase plans until they can determine whether the current lull merely reflects summer doldrums -- a routine occurrence in the housing market -- or the beginning of the bursting of the housing bubble, which would be to their benefit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I am very wary of buying," said John Hiltz, a high-school assistant principal, as he walked through a $665,000 townhouse in Arlington, Virginia, recently. Mr. Hiltz said he fears that if he buys now, he could be buying right before prices fall.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one is suggesting that home prices will crash or that sales will dry up. And there are no signs of cooling in a number of major markets, including Los Angeles and New York. Indeed, most housing-industry economists are still forecasting a healthy market nationwide through 2006.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But real-estate agents say they do see evidence that markets in some metropolitan areas are in the process of readjusting from a purely sellers' market to a market that might be more balanced between buyers and sellers. That, they say, could mean prices will level off or rise more modestly in the months ahead -- especially at the high end of the market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That readjustment is most evident here in metropolitan Washington, which has had one of the strongest housing markets in the country. During the past five years, the region has created 287,000 jobs, making it one of the fastest-growing employment markets in the nation. Job growth, in turn, has triggered strong demand for housing. Average home prices in the Washington area were $376,000 last year, up 72% from 2000. The number of homes selling above $500,000 has risen especially fast, but some are wondering whether there are now too many high-priced properties.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is obviously a change in the market," says Paulette Ladas, a real-estate agent in Silver Spring, Maryland. "Things are taking a bit longer to sell, and we cannot be as aggressive with pricing as we have been in the past."  </p>

</div><div class="author">By Kemba J. Dunham and Ray A. Smith  </div><div>2236 words</div><div>22 August 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>A5A</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AS CONDOMINIUM prices reach never-before-seen heights in the U.S., a debate is brewing over whether a fundamental demographic shift is driving the trend or whether this is simply the latest speculative bubble in a corner of the real-estate market that has seen plenty of them.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, for the first time since the National Association of Realtors started tracking the data, the U.S. national median price of a condo was higher than that of a single-family home. In June, the median price of a condo was $223,500 (183,695 euros), compared with $218,600 for a traditional house. From 2001 to 2004, condo values appreciated 57%, while those of single-family homes rose 25%. And the condo market is booming even in second-tier cities such as Minneapolis; Charlotte, North Carolina; and Omaha, Nebraska.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demographic changes in the middle class can explain some of this. The ideal of the two-parent family with 2.2 children living in a suburban house is being supplanted by an array of arrangements, including single professionals, divorcees, active retirees and single parents. For many of these people, an urban condo is both more luxurious and convenient than a house with a yard.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Today's middle class looks more like the cast of `Friends' than `Ozzie and Harriet,'" says Jason Schenker, an economist at Wachovia Corp. in Charlotte. "They're younger, they're urban and they live in high-cost areas of real estate -- these sorts of things are all conducive to the growth in condominiums."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But economists and housing experts are increasingly concerned that too many people, trying to cash in on the phenomenon, are buying speculatively, causing prices to rise faster than economic fundamentals can support.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers started construction on about 802,000 condo units in the past five years, according to the Census Bureau. More are on the way. About 270,000 condos will be started in 2005 and a further 255,000 in 2006, estimates Michael Carliner, an economist with the National Association of Home Builders, a Washington-based trade association. That doesn't include the sizable but hard-to-quantify number of new buildings that start life as rentals and switch before completion, or the existing offices, hotels and rental properties being converted into condo developments.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In the past, the highest and best uses of land were commercial, but now with condo prices and single-family homes getting such high prices, the demand for land that would have been used for commercial is being shifted to residential," says Anthony Downs, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a real-estate specialist. Median prices for condos may be skewed because many of the newer properties tend to be located in pricey coastal cities or in parts of town where land prices are higher.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers like Keith Battaglia embody both the hot money flowing into the condo market and the changing face of the middle class. Last summer, when the single, 36-year-old hotel executive relocated to Minneapolis, he quickly decided to ditch the suburbs and embrace the city. He waited all night outside the sales office of an unbuilt, luxury-condominium development called the Carlyle.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm so excited to actually be moving to a place that offers Central Park-style living without having to fly to New York to get it," says Mr. Battaglia.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of buying one apartment, he bought two: a fifth-floor unit for $305,000 and a 19th-floor unit for $439,000. When the building opens early next year, he plans to live in one and rent out the other.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a new era for the condo, once viewed as the stepchild of the housing market. Condominium owners buy the walls and interior of their apartment and a percentage of the building's common areas, which are typically managed by a condo association. Condos leapt to prominence after the 1961 Housing Act enabled the Federal Housing Administration to insure mortgages on the units. In those days, the properties were simple and affordable, a starter home for first-time buyers whose dream was to own a more substantial home in the suburbs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the condo market is liquid and prone to speculation, these apartments -- or sometimes townhouses -- typically lost value more rapidly during recessions, compared with other types of residential property. Beginning in the late 1980s, condo prices in Boston fell by as much as 50% in some areas over several years due to overbuilding and rapid conversions, says Karl Case, professor of economics at Wellesley College. He adds that single-family-home prices fell less than half that amount during that time. It took nearly 10 years for condo prices to return to their 1980s peak.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now, families that can easily afford to buy a home are choosing to live in condos, and that says a lot about Americans' changing lifestyles. From 1970 to 2000, the percentage of nuclear families among U.S. households declined to 24% from 40%, according to the Census Bureau. Some studies show that the number of households without children will increase in the next 10 years, while those with children will fall slightly.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders say the rise of the condo also reflects a desire among buyers to live downtown, with easy access to restaurants and entertainment, and no tough daily commute or time-consuming domestic upkeep.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pat Crosby, 38, who owns a Minneapolis company selling products for commercial architects, lives with his girlfriend, Marti Zacher, in Grant Park, a high-end condominium development in town. The divorced father of two young girls lived in the suburbs just a few years ago, gritting his teeth through a 45-minute commute to work.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aside from offering massages and a 24-hour concierge, Grant Park has guest suites and full-service business facilities. That allows Mr. Crosby to conduct business meetings while his daughters splash in the pool next door. "You can't get back time, so I like to spend my free time doing what I like doing, not shoveling snow or taking care of a lawn," says Mr. Crosby. "I would much rather prefer a great sushi dinner and drinks with friends."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike the drab structures of yesteryear, many newly constructed condos are plush abodes, containing the kinds of amenities found only in the most upscale suburban developments, such as marble bathrooms, gourmet kitchens, tennis courts, swimming pools and health clubs. High-end features such as broadband access are also becoming standard. Many new units are larger than those of the past.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spanish View Tower Homes, a luxury development five miles from the Las Vegas Strip, sports a $6.3 million penthouse. The four-bedroom apartment includes a Jacuzzi and warming drawers for towels and robes, plus a 5,800-square-foot roof garden with spa and barbecue area, a media room with a 100-inch television, maid's quarters with separate entrance, wine-storage room and a wine-tasting room.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An unanswered question is whether developers are flooding the market. "The froth in several of these markets is approaching Cisco-stock-price levels circa 2000," says Hans G. Nordby, an analyst with Property &amp; Portfolio Research, a Boston-based firm. Miami, for example, has so many investors, "it's going to implode," he says, adding that he's not convinced there's enough job growth there to support all the condos being built.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nordby says Miami's market is dependent on speculators buying condos before they're built and flipping them in what is known as the preconstruction market. Developers building high-end condominiums often sell individual units long before construction is scheduled to begin, in part because banks won't provide financing until a large percentage of the units are reserved. In many cases, buyers can obtain a purchase contract by putting down just 10% of the sale price.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Miami-based Zilbert Realty Group, one of the city's largest brokers of preconstruction condos, has launched a Web site, Condoflip.com, catering to these speculators. Mark Zilbert, president of Zilbert Realty and creator of the site, says he has received thousands of emails from condo owners who want to gauge the market, but he doesn't yet see many interested buyers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Right now, people can just go ahead and buy a new unit, so they aren't interested in going through the hassle of buying a flip," says Mr. Zilbert.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists and real-estate investors say the ratio of real buyers to investors will ultimately determine the strength of the condo market. In Chicago, for instance, the large number of condo constructions and conversions -- including plans for what would be the nation's tallest building -- has created a supply glut. Several luxury projects have suffered slower-than-expected sales and some high-profile projects have narrowly averted foreclosure after banks came to the rescue.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In the past there wasn't a whole lot out there, but you have a whole bunch of condos all over the place," complains Serge Masyra, a 32-year-old ad-sales executive who put his two-bedroom, two-bath condo on the market last month. He's asking $399,000 for the property, located just five blocks north of Wrigley Field in Chicago, about $50,000 more than he paid for the brand-new unit in early 2004. A year ago, it would have been snapped up in days. Mr. Masyra, so far, has no takers. Still, Chicago has more than 8,000 more condo units in the construction pipeline.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condo fever is also hitting unlikely cities, like Minneapolis, driven by young professionals who want to re-create a big-city lifestyle. "High rises are such a notable change to the landscape here," says Tom O'Neil, director of market research at DSU Research, a unit of Minneapolis planning consultants Dahlgren, Shardlow &amp; Uban Inc. "There's some prestige to being in a tall building, so people are getting excited about it."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Karen Van Dongen, a 34-year-old sales manager for a consumer-products company, moved to Minneapolis from the suburban town of Lodi, New Jersey, late last year to work on her company's Target Corp. account. Target is based in Minneapolis. She initially considered buying a loft in an old industrial building that needed some work -- "something that would mirror a Manhattan, cosmopolitan life" -- but ditched that plan after checking out the amenity-jammed condos in Grant Park.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Van Dongen said she was making "a lifestyle choice." Since she likes to spend her free time "doing nothing," she wanted the extras offered at the condo without maintenance work.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Omaha, out-of-town developers have proposed a slew of condominium projects hoping to capitalize on the city's relatively sparse market. A steady stream of companies has either relocated to the city or expanded their local operations in recent years, including Union Pacific Corp. and Gallup Organization. Developers are betting on an influx of white-collar professionals from cities such as Denver, St. Louis and Houston.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Omaha real-estate agents say the new residents have brought along their tastes for city living. Most of the first phase of condos and townhouses at the Riverfront Place development have sold out at prices ranging from $250,000 to $1.65 million since going on sale last November. Greg Deman, 50, who owns a warehouse-distribution company in Sioux City, Iowa, this year purchased three condos in one Omaha building as an investment. They cost between $250,000 and $350,000. He's looking for more.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I might be guessing right or I might be guessing wrong, but I think this area's going to continue to grow," says Mr. Deman, who visits Omaha about six times a year. He's also interested in investing in Phoenix and Las Vegas.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers along Alabama's Gulf Coast are currently replacing beachfront property damaged by last year's Hurricane Ivan with high-rise condo buildings. The area has 11,850 condominium units and 12,600 more are in the pipeline, according to the Alabama Gulf Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market is drawing baby boomers and investors, some of whom are using letters of credit instead of cash down payments to reserve preconstruction units. A letter of credit is a promise backed by a bank to make a future payment, sometimes secured by personal assets. Local real-estate agents say these buyers are requesting larger-than-average units, such as condos that take up the whole floor of a building.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Admiral's Quarters condominium resort in Orange Beach, Alabama, a 1,500-square-foot two-bedroom condo sold for $860,000 a few months ago, compared with $483,000 in 2003. The units come with Jacuzzis, wet bars, walk-in closets and oversize balconies with views of the Gulf of Mexico. Residents have access to a heated indoor swimming pool, sauna and boardwalk to a private beach.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past few years, these condos have appreciated in value more than 70% each year. "The market down here is extraordinary," says Elizabeth Helton Walls, an Orange Beach, Alabama, real-estate agent. "Since Ivan, people were worried that properties were going to drop, but they've gone up every month."  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BANKS PROMOTE exotic mortgages, tiny apartments sell for outrageous prices and regulators worry about loose lending standards.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. in 2005? No, Japan in the early 1990s, when banks helped people purchase increasingly expensive homes by, among other things, issuing 100-year mortgages that were meant to be paid off by later generations. Japanese authorities halted the boom by raising interest rates and tightening lending standards -- ushering in a long, slow property decline.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are plenty of differences between Japan then and the U.S. today. But a search through boom-bust cycles of the past -- from Tokyo to California to Boston -- offers lessons about today's American real-estate boom and how it might play out.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People who have studied past busts point to two main causes: a drying up of liquidity -- often through tighter lending standards or higher interest rates -- or a serious economic shock, like an oil or currency crisis.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property booms themselves don't guarantee a bust. In a study of housing booms in 14 advanced economies during the past 35 years, the International Monetary Fund found that at least a third didn't bust. But in countries experiencing a nationwide real-estate bust, the consequences can be drawn out and severe. All but one have been associated with recessions, and many have been tied to banking crises as well.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"History can tell you how bad things can get and can give you some ideas about some of the causes of what happened," says Michael Bordo, a professor of economic history at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are some important signposts:  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">`REFUSE TO LOSE': People often act irrationally when housing markets go sour.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From 1982 to 1989, condo prices in Boston nearly tripled. Then demand dried up. But rather than cut asking prices, many owners decided to sit tight and hope. By 1992, fewer than 30% of Boston condos sold within six months, while hundreds languished at prices few buyers were willing to pay.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christopher Mayer, a Columbia University economist who studied the Boston boom and bust, found that through the early stages of the downturn, people had a strong aversion to selling at a loss, even if such a sale would have freed them to buy another house in the same market on the cheap.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Psychology is impairing their ability to make good economic decisions," says Prof. Mayer. Economists call this "loss aversion" -- people are much more unwilling to face reality and sell losers than they are to sell winners. He says it's the key factor that makes real-estate markets so slow to adjust in a downturn.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Refusing to sell at a loss is the main reason people freeze up. Others can't afford to sell: Their mortgage balances are higher than the price they could get.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's what happened to Kathryn McMiller, a consultant who helps hospitals manage information. People were camping out to be first in line for new homes when she bought a $130,000 condo in Trabuco Canyon, California, in 1991. Her plan was to sell the condo after a few years at a big profit so she could afford a bigger home with a yard.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shortly after her purchase, however, prices began declining. Within a few years, some condos identical to hers were going for $90,000. "I couldn't afford to sell," says Ms. McMiller. The proceeds wouldn't have covered the amount she owed on her mortgage. So she stayed put until 1999, when the market recovered enough for her to sell for about the same price she paid in 1991.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOLLOW THE MONEY: To understand a boom, you need to understand its enablers. In property booms, it tends to be the banks.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Susan Wachter and Richard Herring, economists at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, say bankers in the past have tended to suffer from "disaster myopia," an inability to envision worst-case scenarios during long stretches of good times. That encourages them to loosen lending standards.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Japan's long economic boom provided fuel for jusen, specialized home lenders such as Nippon Housing Loan Co., creator of the 100-year mortgage, which was supposed to be paid off by the borrower's grandchildren. "There needs to be fuel for a boom, and banks historically provided that fuel," says Prof. Wachter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S. today, banks are selling increasingly exotic mortgages, such as interest-only loans and loans that backload interest and principal payments. But the key difference is they don't hold the loans; instead, many sell them off to investors as bonds. That does protect individual banks, but it could spread the risk throughout the financial system.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOCATION. LOCATION. LOCATION: As homeowners in Cleveland and Dallas will tell you, there is no housing bubble in many parts of the U.S. On a scale much smaller, something similar was true in Hong Kong a decade ago: Average prices soared 61% from 1995 to 1997. But even though Hong Kong is just a few times the size of Washington, D.C., price increases varied widely, ranging from 28% in some buildings to 248% in others.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is surprising how much variation we can find in such a small place," says Grace Wong, a professor at the Wharton School's Zell/Lurie Real Estate Center. She found that as Hong Kong's handover to China approached, districts with more pro-China leanings faced less political uncertainty and thus less market speculation, resulting in more modest price increases.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A study of regional U.S. housing bubbles by Friedman, Billings, Ramsey &amp; Co., an Arlington, Virginia, brokerage firm, found that in the period from 1987 to 1994, bubbles in 42 metropolitan areas lasted anywhere from one to 31 quarters. Median house prices subsequently fell by as much as 39%, but in some areas they didn't fall at all. "It is striking that the durations of bubbles and the magnitudes of the subsequent declines in house prices vary so widely," said Michael Youngblood, the author of the report.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE DOG THAT DIDN'T BARK: Not all booms end in a housing bust.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Declining oil prices shocked the Texas economy in the 1980s, and defense cutbacks in southern California hurt the Los Angeles job base in the early 1990s, causing nasty housing busts in both cases. So when the technology bubble burst in 2000, home prices in the tech-dependant San Francisco Bay area seemed primed to fall. But they haven't. Five years after the bust, the median sales prices of existing San Francisco homes were 41% higher, at $641,700.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house price bubbles that Friedman Billings Ramsey found from 1987 to 1994 ranged from Boston to Tallahassee, Florida, to Tucson, Arizona. But in 14 markets, the bubbles never burst, including in many of today's frothy markets, such as San Diego, Santa Barbara and San Jose.  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHEN AMERICA'S housing boom finally ends, don't expect a loud pop.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not going to be a big dramatic event," says William Apgar, senior scholar at Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike stock prices, the housing market can't collapse in a few days. People can dump their stocks almost instantly, but it often takes months to sell a house.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In past housing busts in California, New England and elsewhere, many owners who couldn't get what they considered a reasonable price yanked their houses off the market. The number of transactions plunged but prices fell only gradually, often over several years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, that's little reassurance for people who are worried that they bought at the top of the market or for those waiting for prices to ease before jumping in. And the end of the boom is likely to be painful for many people. Among the most vulnerable: people who may have to sell in a weak market because of a job loss or transfer; those with little or no equity in their homes and big mortgages; and those counting on big gains in home equity to make up for a lack of retirement savings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">America's housing boom has been an enormous boost to the U.S. economy, spurring construction, increasing the net worth of millions of families and allowing people to borrow against the rising value of their homes. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com, a forecasting firm in West Chester, Pennsylvania, says the housing surge accounts for nearly 40% of the four million jobs created by the U.S. economy in the past two years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists disagree about how much damage a housing downturn would inflict on the economy. Mr. Zandi hopes that strong job growth in other parts of the economy will cushion any blow from housing. But, he says, the risks of harm to the economy will grow if house prices keep surging for another year or two.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Predictions that the U.S. housing market would falter soon have proved premature repeatedly. Still, many economists believe the boom is now peaking or will do so within a year or so. Few expect a sharp fall in prices nationwide, but lots of economists think prices will decline at least modestly in some of the cities along the East and West coasts, where buying has been most frenzied.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has been unusually hot for the past five years largely because low interest rates have allowed Americans to borrow and spend more. The National Association of Realtors forecasts that sales of new and previously owned homes will total 8.2 million in 2005, setting a record for the fifth year in a row. That would be nearly twice the 4.2 million sales recorded in 1995.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the five years through June, America's median house price grew at an inflation-adjusted average annual rate of 4.9%, according to the Realtors. That's triple the annual average since the real-estate trade group began compiling the data in 1968. In some places, the rise has been far greater. The median price (not adjusted for inflation) shot up 47% to $243,400 in the Phoenix area over the past 12 months, the Realtors say.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How bad could the next downturn be? Optimists say that the pace of price increases will merely slow to a more sustainable level. Many economists say past drops in house prices have been recorded only in places where lots of jobs have been lost. One example is Los Angeles, hit by a rapid shrinkage of the aerospace industry in the early 1990s. In cities with strong job markets, home prices have tended to keep rising, albeit at a slower rate, when the market cooled.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, history shows that house-price declines are less rare than many Realtors suggest in their sales spiels. Richard J. DeKaser, chief economist at National City Corp., a Cleveland-based banking concern, recently studied home prices in 299 metropolitan areas over the past 20 years. He found that 63 of them at some point suffered declines of 10% or more over periods of at least two years. The worst hit was Lafayette, Louisiana, where prices fell 39% in the late 1980s amid a slump in the oil industry. Honolulu, hurt by a decline in Japanese tourism, sank 20% in the late 1990s. The median decline in those 63 markets was 17%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The end of the boom isn't likely to cause a recession, however, says Mr. DeKaser. He expects prices to erode in some overheated markets. But because the housing market depends so much on local conditions, prices probably will continue to rise in some places as they fall in others, diluting the effect on the national economy, he says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unless interest rates rise much more sharply than expected, there is no reason to expect a national housing crash, says Allen Sinai, chief global economist at Decision Economics Inc. in Boston. "I don't think this is a situation of boom-bust," he says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Edward Leamer, an economics professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, says he thinks a housing downturn could "kick the economy into slow growth and possibly an outright recession." He counts 10 declines in residential investment since World War II. Eight of them, he says, provided the early warnings for recessions.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The National Association of Realtors warned home buyers about the risks of mortgages that offer low initial payments, so-called "affordability" loans that have helped push house prices higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real-estate trade group joins Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan and bank regulators who have been speaking out recently about the possibility that these loans could lead to an increase in defaults. But the Realtors' warning is particularly striking because affordability loans help realtors sell homes in high-cost areas to people who couldn't otherwise afford them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a press release, the Realtors said home buyers "may not realize that monthly payments on some types of specialty mortgages can increase by as much as 50% or more when the introductory period ends." The Realtors have teamed up with the Center for Responsible Lending, a nonprofit group, to create a brochure offering advice on choosing a mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mortgages in question include interest-only loans with rates that adjust periodically based on fluctuations in an interest-rate index. Another increasingly popular type of loan is known as an option ARM, or adjustable-rate mortgage. Borrowers have several payment options each month, including one that falls short of even the interest due. When borrowers select that option, their loan balances grow, a phenomenon known as "negative amortization."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These loans are particularly popular in California and other places where home prices have soared. The danger is that homes will be harder to sell and loans more difficult to refinance if the housing market droops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Al Mansell, the Realtors' president, said these loans are fine for some people who can easily handle higher payments later but "they may be getting over-marketed and oversold." </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As condominium prices reach never-before-seen heights, a debate is brewing over whether a fundamental demographic shift is driving the trend or whether this is simply the latest speculative bubble in a corner of the real-estate market that has seen plenty of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, for the first time since the National Association of Realtors started tracking the data, the national median price of a condo was higher than that of a single-family home. In June, the median price of a condo was $223,500, compared with $218,600 for a traditional house. Between 2001 and 2004, condo values appreciated 57%, while those of single-family homes rose 25%. And the condo market is booming even in second-tier cities such as Minneapolis, Charlotte, N.C., and Omaha, Neb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demographic changes in the middle class can explain some of this. The ideal of the two-parent family with 2.2 children living in a suburban house is being supplanted by an array of arrangements, including single professionals, divorcees, active retirees and single parents. For many of these people, an urban condo is both more luxurious and convenient than a house with a yard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Today's middle class looks more like the cast of `Friends' than `Ozzie and Harriet,'" says Jason Schenker, an economist at Wachovia Corp. in Charlotte. "They're younger, they're urban and they live in high-cost areas of real estate -- these sorts of things are all conducive to the growth in condominiums."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But economists and housing experts are increasingly concerned that too many people, trying to cash in on the phenomenon, are buying speculatively, causing prices to rise faster than economic fundamentals can support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers started construction on about 802,000 condo units in the past five years, according to the Census Bureau. More are on the way. About 270,000 condos will be started in 2005 and a further 255,000 in 2006, estimates Michael Carliner, an economist with the National Association of Home Builders, a Washington-based trade association. That doesn't include the sizable but hard-to-quantify number of new buildings that start life as rentals and switch before completion, or the existing offices, hotels and rental properties being converted into condo developments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In the past, the highest and best uses of land were commercial, but now with condo prices and single-family homes getting such high prices, the demand for land that would have been used for commercial is being shifted to residential," says Anthony Downs, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a real-estate specialist. Median prices for condos may be skewed because many of the newer properties tend to be located in pricey coastal cities or in parts of town where land prices are higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers like Keith Battaglia embody both the hot money flowing into the condo market and the changing face of the middle class. Last summer, when the single, 36-year-old hotel executive relocated to Minneapolis, he quickly decided to ditch the suburbs and embrace the city. He waited all night outside the sales office of an unbuilt, luxury-condominium development called the Carlyle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm so excited to actually be moving to a place that offers Central Park-style living without having to fly to New York to get it," says Mr. Battaglia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of buying one apartment, he bought two: a fifth-floor unit for $305,000 and a 19th-floor unit for $439,000. When the building opens early next year, he plans to live in one and rent out the other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a new era for the condo, once viewed as the stepchild of the housing market. Condominium owners buy the walls and interior of their apartment and a percentage of the building's common areas, which are typically managed by a condo association. Condos leapt to prominence after the 1961 Housing Act enabled the Federal Housing Administration to insure mortgages on the units. In those days, the properties were simple and affordable, a starter home for first-time buyers whose dream was to own a more substantial home in the suburbs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the condo market is liquid and prone to speculation, these apartments -- or sometimes townhouses -- typically lost value more rapidly during recessions, compared with other types of residential property. Beginning in the late 1980s, condo prices in Boston fell by as much as 50% in some areas over several years due to overbuilding and rapid conversions, says Karl Case, professor of economics at Wellesley College. He adds that single-family-home prices fell less than half that amount during that time. It took nearly 10 years for condo prices to return to their 1980s peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now, families that can easily afford to buy a home are choosing to live in condos, and that says a lot about Americans' changing lifestyles. Between 1970 and 2000, the percentage of nuclear families among U.S. households declined to 24% from 40%, according to the Census Bureau. Some studies show that the number of households without children will increase in the next 10 years, while those with children will fall slightly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders say the rise of the condo also reflects a desire among buyers to live downtown, with easy access to restaurants and entertainment, and no tough daily commute or time-consuming domestic upkeep.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pat Crosby, 38, who owns a Minneapolis company selling products for commercial architects, lives with his girlfriend, Marti Zacher, in Grant Park, a high-end condominium development in town. The divorced father of two young girls lived in the suburbs just a few years ago, gritting his teeth through a 45-minute commute to work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aside from offering massages and a 24-hour concierge, Grant Park has guest suites and full-service business facilities. That allows Mr. Crosby to conduct business meetings while his daughters splash in the pool next door. "You can't get back time, so I like to spend my free time doing what I like doing, not shoveling snow or taking care of a lawn," says Mr. Crosby. "I would much rather prefer a great sushi dinner and drinks with friends."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike the drab structures of yesteryear, many newly constructed condos are plush abodes, containing the kinds of amenities found only in the most upscale suburban developments, such as marble bathrooms, gourmet kitchens, tennis courts, swimming pools and health clubs. High-end features such as broadband access are also becoming standard. Many new units are larger than those of the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spanish View Tower Homes, a luxury development five miles from the Las Vegas strip, sports a $6.3 million penthouse. The four-bedroom apartment includes a Jacuzzi and warming drawers for towels and robes, plus a 5,800-square-foot roof garden with spa and barbecue area, a media room with a 100-inch television, maid's quarters with separate entrance, wine-storage room and a wine-tasting room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An unanswered question is whether developers are flooding the market. "The froth in several of these markets is approaching Cisco-stock-price levels circa 2000," says Hans G. Nordby, an analyst with Property &amp;Portfolio Research, a Boston-based firm. Miami, for example, has so many investors, "it's going to implode," he says, adding that he's not convinced there's enough job growth there to support all the condos being built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nordby says Miami's market is dependent on speculators buying condos before they're built and flipping them in what is known as the preconstruction market. Developers building high-end condominiums often sell individual units long before construction is scheduled to begin, in part because banks won't provide financing until a large percentage of the units are reserved. In many cases, buyers can obtain a purchase contract by putting down just 10% of the sale price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Miami-based Zilbert Realty Group, one of the city's largest brokers of preconstruction condos, has launched a Web site, Condoflip.com, catering to these speculators. Mark Zilbert, president of Zilbert Realty and creator of the site, says he's received thousands of emails from condo owners who want to gauge the market, but he doesn't yet see many interested buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Right now, people can just go ahead and buy a new unit, so they aren't interested in going through the hassle of buying a flip," says Mr. Zilbert.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists and real-estate investors say the ratio of real buyers to investors will ultimately determine the strength of the condo market. In Chicago, for instance, the large number of condo constructions and conversions -- including plans for what would be the nation's tallest building -- has created a supply glut. Several luxury projects have suffered slower-than-expected sales and some high-profile projects have narrowly averted foreclosure after banks came to the rescue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In the past there wasn't a whole lot out there, but you have a whole bunch of condos all over the place," complains Serge Masyra, a 32-year-old ad-sales executive who put his two-bedroom, two-bath condo on the market last month. He's asking $399,000 for the property, located just five blocks north of Chicago's Wrigley Field, about $50,000 more than he paid for the brand-new unit in early 2004. A year ago, it would have been snapped up in days. Mr. Masyra, so far, has no takers. Still, Chicago has over 8,000 more condo units in the construction pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condo fever is also hitting unlikely cities, like Minneapolis, driven by young professionals who want to re-create a big-city lifestyle. "High rises are such a notable change to the landscape here," says Tom O'Neil, director of market research at DSU Research, a unit of Minneapolis planning consultants Dahlgren, Shardlow &amp;Uban Inc. "There's some prestige to being in a tall building, so people are getting excited about it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Karen Van Dongen, a 34-year-old sales manager for a consumer-products company, moved to Minneapolis from the suburban town of Lodi, N.J., late last year to work on her company's Target Corp. account. Target is based in Minneapolis. She initially considered buying a loft in an old industrial building that needed some work -- "something that would mirror a Manhattan, cosmopolitan life" -- but ditched that plan after checking out the amenity-jammed condos in Grant Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Van Dongen said she was making "a lifestyle choice." Since she likes to spend her free time "doing nothing," she wanted the extras offered at the condo without maintenance work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Omaha, out-of-town developers have proposed a slew of condominium projects hoping to capitalize on the city's relatively sparse market. A steady stream of companies has either relocated to the city or expanded their local operations in recent years, including Union Pacific Corp. and Gallup Organization. Developers are betting on an influx of white-collar professionals from cities such as Denver, St. Louis and Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Omaha real-estate agents say the new residents have brought along their tastes for city living. Most of the first phase of condos and townhouses at the Riverfront Place development have sold out at prices ranging from $250,000 to $1.65 million since going on sale last November. Greg Deman, 50, who owns a warehouse-distribution company in Sioux City, Iowa, earlier this year purchased three condos in one Omaha building as an investment. They cost between $250,000 and $350,000. He's looking for more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I might be guessing right or I might be guessing wrong, but I think this area's going to continue to grow," says Mr. Deman, who visits Omaha about six times a year. He's also interested in investing in Phoenix and Las Vegas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers along Alabama's Gulf Coast are currently replacing beachfront property damaged by last year's Hurricane Ivan with high-rise condo buildings. The area has 11,850 condominium units and 12,600 more are in the pipeline, according to the Alabama Gulf Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market is drawing baby boomers and investors, some of whom are using letters of credit instead of cash down payments to reserve preconstruction units. A letter of credit is a promise backed by a bank to make a future payment, sometimes secured by personal assets. Local real-estate agents say these buyers are requesting larger-than-average units, such as condos that take up the whole floor of a building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Admiral's Quarters condominium resort in Orange Beach, Ala., a 1,500-square-foot two-bedroom condo sold for $860,000 a few months ago, compared with $483,000 in 2003. The units come with Jacuzzis, wet bars, walk-in closets and oversize balconies with views of the Gulf of Mexico. Residents have access to a heated indoor swimming pool, sauna and boardwalk to a private beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past few years, these condos have appreciated in value more than 70% each year. "The market down here is extraordinary," says Elizabeth Helton Walls, an Orange Beach, Ala., real-estate agent. "Since Ivan, people were worried that properties were going to drop, but they've gone up every month." </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While your Aug. 12 editorial "The Realtor Racket" reached the right conclusion on the issue of virtual office web sites, it missed the mark in its discussion of the real estate marketplace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors has no position on minimum service rules. State governments have the authority to regulate the licensing of real estate brokers and agents, and some state Realtor associations support strengthening licensing rules to ensure consumers receive a minimum level of service when they sign exclusive agency agreements with brokers. They feel that requiring real estate agents to return their clients' phone calls and communicate with them about the biggest financial transaction of their lives is a reasonable thing to ask.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAR does, however, support innovation, competition and the application of new business models that bring about greater efficiency, lower cost and better service. Realtors have helped the Internet bring about significant change in the real estate industry. In what other business can you view 95% of the national inventory -- 2.2 million homes -- online 24 hours a day, seven days a week, as you can through Realtor.com?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few businesses are as competitive as real estate. Real estate has a relatively low barrier of entry. That's one reason real estate is open to new ideas. Consumers have choice in every community. One out of every 186 American adults -- over 1.2 million people -- is a Realtor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">America's homeownership rate, over 70%, is due in large part to the quality of our real estate services. Your editorial compares commission rates with those abroad, but not quality of service. Still, caution is in order when making any empirical comparisons among countries. There are too many factors involved to permit simple comparisons. After all, no business is more local than real estate.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is unconscionable that an organization whose members owe a fiduciary duty to home sellers is working so hard to deny consumers the substantial cost savings that should be available to them. The amount of money involved boggles the mind. Commissions in other countries where real estate brokers don't rig the political system are 1.5% lower than they are in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even worse than the real estate brokers' powerful lobbying machine is asking legislators to pass these restrictive laws to "protect" consumers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a shame that well-intended legislators and governors in some states have bought into the traditional brokers' party line. American homeowners don't like being forced to pay an additional commission for services they neither want nor need. We hope that state legislators in those states will reconsider their actions and will repeal the anticompetitive state laws that are hurting their constituents.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Michael Schroeder  </div><div>698 words</div><div>17 August 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer prices in the U.S. rose in July at the fastest pace in three months as gasoline prices surged, while new housing starts remained on pace for a 33-year annual record.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consumer-price index rose 0.5% last month, the biggest increase since April, the U.S. Labor Department said. But half the gain resulted from a 3.8% jump in energy prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction starts on new homes and apartments dropped only 0.1% in July, keeping the indicator above the robust two-million mark, the U.S. Commerce Department said. The tiny decline in starts to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.042 million followed an upwardly revised 2.045 million level in June. With housing showing no sign of cooling, the year's starts could be the highest since 1972 if the 2.060 million average annual rate for the first seven months of the year is sustained.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slight fall was attributed almost exclusively to declines in multifamily construction. Starts of housing with two or more units decreased 3.2% to 331,000 units, while construction of homes with five or more units dropped 5.6% to 289,000 units. Starts of single-family homes rose 0.5% to 1.71 million, the report said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Permits for future building rose 1.6% in July to a 2.167 million annual rate, indicating that the strong market will continue.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The underlying fundamentals of low mortgage rates and rapid price appreciation continued to provide substantial support for home builders," said Steven Wood, an economist at Insight Economics LLC.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With rampant vehicle discounting and large-scale declines in apparel prices the past month, the U.S. core inflation index, which excludes food and energy items, rose a moderate 0.1% for the third month in a row, the Labor Department said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past four months the core rate has increased at an annual rate of only 1.3%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices of new automobiles registered the biggest decline in more than 30 years, falling 1%. Both housing prices and medical care rose 0.4% in July, marking the biggest increase since March in both categories.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"On the whole, the report was consistent with little change in underlying inflation trends, and will not change the Federal Reserve's current proclivity for `measured' quarter-percentage-point tightening," said Peter Kretzmer, a senior economist at Bank of America Corp.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. central bank has raised its federal funds rate 10 times since June 2004, to 3.5%. Federal Reserve policy makers said last week that the rate will need to rise further to keep inflation in check.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed also reported that industrial production rose just 0.1% last month, after big increases at factories and utilities in June.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial production was restrained last month by a 1.3% decline in mining activity related to hurricane-related shutdowns in the Gulf of Mexico. Unusually hot weather was responsible for the utility sector's 0.7% boost last month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the report continues to show underlying strength in the industrial sector, "large declines in motor-vehicle production, always a volatile sector on a month-to-month basis, and cuts in petroleum refining were . . . causes of the slower growth," said Daniel J. Meckstroth, chief economist for the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, a public-policy group in Arlington, Virginia.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Capacity utilization slipped one-tenth of a percentage point to 79.7%, and manufacturing use was unchanged at 78.3%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Utilization rates have regained good portions of ground lost during the recession, but the economy still has a fair amount of room to boost output before production constraints become serious," said Michael Moran, an economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the Labor Department said the average weekly earnings of U.S. workers, adjusted for inflation, fell 0.2% in July, the first decline in three months.  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soaring crude-oil prices caused consumer inflation in the U.S. to increase at the fastest pace in three months in July, but price pressures away from the gasoline station and the grocery store were restrained, suggesting the Federal Reserve will continue to raise interest rates gradually.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Labor Department said yesterday its consumer-price index rose 0.5% last month, the biggest increase since April, and was 3.2% higher than a year ago. The so-called core index, which excludes food and energy items, rose by a moderate 0.1% for the third month in a row -- and was 2.1% higher than last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report largely conformed with the Federal Reserve's view that the U.S. economy is seeing relatively low core inflation in recent months while inflationary pressures remain elevated. Though runaway oil prices have been a topic of concern for many months, they have largely not led to higher prices across the broader economy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new data suggest the Fed is unlikely to change course in the near term. The central bank has raised its key federal-funds rate 10 times since June 2004, lifting it to 3.5% in increments of a quarter percentage point. According to a recent survey by The Wall Street Journal Online, economists on average expect the federal-funds rate to be 4% by December and 4.25% by next June, though some expect the funds rate by next summer to be as high as 5%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall energy prices climbed 3.8% in July, the biggest increase in three months. In a month when crude-oil prices averaged a record $59 a barrel, gasoline prices climbed 6.1%, also marking the biggest increase in three months. Natural-gas prices rose 3.8%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Food prices also rose at the fastest pace in three months, climbing 0.2%. Housing prices rose 0.4%, marking the biggest increase since March. Medical-care prices rose 0.4%, also the biggest increase since March. But prices of new automobiles registered the biggest decline in more than 30 years, falling 1%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the Labor Department said the average weekly earnings of U.S. workers, adjusted for inflation, fell 0.2% in July. That marked the first decline in three months. Average hourly earnings rose 0.4%, but that gain was offset by a 0.6% increase in the CPI for urban wage earners and clerical workers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. industrial production rose modestly in July, restrained by declines in mining and consumer-goods output, the Federal Reserve said yesterday. Production edged up just 0.1% after rising a revised 0.8% in June. Capacity utilization fell 0.1% in July to 79.7% from a revised 79.8% in June.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Output of consumer goods fell 0.5% in July after rising 1.1% in June. Within this category, a 2.9% drop in output of automotive products "contributed heavily to the decrease" in consumer durable goods, the Fed said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New residential construction fell 0.1% in July to a seasonally adjusted 2.042 million annual rate, the Commerce Department said yesterday. June housing starts increased to a revised 2.045 million from May's 2.041 million rate. Permits for future building rose by 1.6% in July to a 2.167 million annual rate. Permits increased a revised 3.4% in June to 2.132 million.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices of new automobiles registered the biggest decline in more than 30 years, falling 1%. Both housing prices and medical care rose 0.4% in July, marking the biggest increase since March in both categories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"On the whole, the report was consistent with little change in underlying inflation trends and will not change the Federal Reserve's current proclivity for `measured' quarter-percentage-point tightening," said Peter Kretzmer, a senior economist at Bank of America Corp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. central bank has raised its federal-funds rate 10 times since June 2004, to 3.5%. Federal Reserve policy makers said last week that the rate will need to rise further to keep inflation in check.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed also reported that industrial production rose just 0.1% last month, after big increases at factories and utilities in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial production was restrained last month by a 1.3% decline in mining activity related to hurricane-related shutdowns in the Gulf of Mexico. Unusually hot weather was responsible for the utility sector's 0.7% boost last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the report continues to show underlying strength in the industrial sector, "large declines in motor-vehicle production, always a volatile sector on a month-to-month basis, and cuts in petroleum refining were . . . causes of the slower growth," said Daniel J. Meckstroth, chief economist for the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, a public-policy group in Arlington, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Capacity utilization slipped one-tenth of a percentage point to 79.7%, and manufacturing use was unchanged at 78.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Utilization rates have regained good portions of ground lost during the recession, but the economy still has a fair amount of room to boost output before production constraints become serious," said Michael Moran, an economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the Labor Department said the average weekly earnings of U.S. workers, adjusted for inflation, fell 0.2% in July, the first decline in three months.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BANKS PROMOTE exotic mortgages, tiny apartments sell for outrageous prices, and regulators worry about loose lending standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. in 2005? No, Japan in the early 1990s, when banks helped people purchase increasingly expensive homes by, among other things, issuing 100-year mortgages that were meant to be paid off by later generations. Japanese authorities halted the boom by raising interest rates and tightening lending standards -- ushering in a long, slow property decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are plenty of differences between Japan then and the U.S. today. But a search through boom-bust cycles of the past -- from Tokyo to California to Boston -- offers lessons about today's real-estate boom and how it might play out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People who have studied past busts point to two main causes: a drying up of liquidity -- often through tighter lending standards or higher interest rates -- or a serious economic shock, like an oil or currency crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property booms themselves don't guarantee a bust. In a study of housing booms in 14 advanced economies during the past 35 years, the International Monetary Fund found that at least a third didn't bust. But in countries experiencing a nationwide real-estate bust, the consequences can be drawn out and severe. All but one have been associated with recessions, and many have been tied to banking crises as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"History can tell you how bad things can get and can give you some ideas about some of the causes of what happened," says Michael Bordo, a professor of economic history at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are some important signposts:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">`REFUSE TO LOSE': People often act irrationally when housing markets go sour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From 1982 to 1989, condo prices in Boston nearly tripled. Then demand dried up. But rather than cut asking prices, many owners decided to sit tight and hope. By 1992, fewer than 30% of Boston condos sold within six months, while hundreds languished at prices few buyers were willing to pay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christopher Mayer, a Columbia University economist who studied the Boston boom and bust, found that through the early stages of the downturn, people had a strong aversion to selling at a loss, even if such a sale would have freed them to buy another house in the same market on the cheap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Psychology is impairing their ability to make good economic decisions," says Prof. Mayer. Economists call this "loss aversion" -- people are much more unwilling to face reality and sell losers than they are to sell winners. He says it's the key factor that makes real-estate markets so slow to adjust in a downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Refusing to sell at a loss is the main reason people freeze up. Others can't afford to sell: Their mortgage balances are higher than the price they could get.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's what happened to Kathryn McMiller, a consultant who helps hospitals manage information. People were camping out to be first in line for new homes when she bought a $130,000 condo in Trabuco Canyon, Calif., in 1991. Her plan was to sell the condo after a few years at a big profit so she could afford a bigger home with a yard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shortly after her purchase, however, prices began declining. Within a few years, some condos identical to hers were going for $90,000. "I couldn't afford to sell," says Ms. McMiller. The proceeds wouldn't have covered the amount she owed on her mortgage. So she stayed put until 1999, when the market recovered enough for her to sell for about the same price she paid in 1991.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOLLOW THE MONEY: To understand a boom, you need to understand its enablers. In property booms, it tends to be the banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Susan Wachter and Richard Herring, economists at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, say bankers in the past have tended to suffer from "disaster myopia," an inability to envision worst-case scenarios during long stretches of good times. That encourages them to loosen lending standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Japan's long economic boom provided fuel for jusen, specialized home lenders such as Nippon Housing Loan Co., creator of the 100-year mortgage, which was supposed to be paid off by the borrower's grandchildren. "There needs to be fuel for a boom, and banks historically provided that fuel," says Prof. Wachter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S. today, banks are selling increasingly exotic mortgages, such as interest-only loans and loans that backload interest and principal payments. But the key difference is they don't hold the loans; instead, many sell them off to investors as bonds. That does protect individual banks, but it could spread the risk throughout the financial system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOCATION. LOCATION. LOCATION: As homeowners in Cleveland and Dallas will tell you, there is no housing bubble in many parts of the country. On a scale much smaller than the U.S., something similar was true in Hong Kong a decade ago: Average prices soared 61% from 1995 to 1997. But even though Hong Kong is just a few times the size of Washington, D.C., price increases varied widely, ranging from 28% in some buildings to 248% in others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is surprising how much variation we can find in such a small place," says Grace Wong, a professor at the Wharton School's Zell/Lurie Real Estate Center. She found that as Hong Kong's handover to China approached, districts with more pro-China leanings faced less political uncertainty and thus less market speculation, resulting in more modest price increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A study of regional U.S. housing bubbles by Friedman, Billings, Ramsey &amp;Co., an Arlington, Va., brokerage firm, found that in the period from 1987 to 1994, bubbles in 42 metropolitan areas lasted anywhere from one to 31 quarters. Median house prices subsequently fell by as much as 39%, but in some areas they didn't fall at all. "It is striking that the durations of bubbles and the magnitudes of the subsequent declines in house prices vary so widely," said Michael Youngblood, the author of the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE DOG THAT DIDN'T BARK: Not all booms end in a housing bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Declining oil prices shocked the Texas economy in the 1980s, and defense cutbacks in southern California hurt the Los Angeles job base in the early 1990s, causing nasty housing busts in both cases. So when the technology bubble burst in 2000, home prices in the tech-dependant San Francisco Bay area seemed primed to fall. But they haven't. Five years after the bust, the median sales prices of existing San Francisco homes were 41% higher, at $641,700.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house price bubbles that Friedman Billings Ramsey found from 1987 to 1994 ranged from Boston to Tallahassee, Fla., to Tucson, Ariz. But in 14 markets, the bubbles never burst, including in many of today's frothy markets, such as San Diego, Santa Barbara, and San Jose.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHEN AMERICA'S housing boom finally ends, don't expect a loud pop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not going to be a big dramatic event," says William Apgar, senior scholar at Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike stock prices, the housing market can't collapse in a few days. People can dump their stocks almost instantly, but it often takes months to sell a house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In past housing busts in California, New England and elsewhere, many owners who couldn't get what they considered a reasonable price yanked their houses off the market. The number of transactions plunged but prices fell only gradually, often over several years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, that's little reassurance for Americans who are worried that they bought at the top of the market or for those waiting for prices to ease before jumping in. And the end of the boom is likely to be painful for many people. Among the most vulnerable: people who may have to sell in a weak market because of a job loss or transfer; those with little or no equity in their homes and big mortgages; and those counting on big gains in home equity to make up for a lack of retirement savings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing boom has been an enormous boost to the economy, spurring construction, increasing the net worth of millions of families and allowing Americans to borrow against the rising value of their homes. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com, a forecasting firm in West Chester, Pa., says the housing surge accounts for nearly 40% of the four million jobs created by the U.S. economy over the past two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists disagree about how much damage a housing downturn would inflict on the economy. Mr. Zandi hopes that strong job growth in other parts of the economy will cushion any blow from housing. But, he says, the risks of harm to the economy will grow if house prices keep surging for another year or two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Predictions that the housing market would falter soon have proved premature repeatedly. Still, many economists believe the boom is now peaking or will do so within a year or so. Few expect a sharp fall in prices nationwide but lots of economists think prices will decline at least modestly in some of the cities along the East and West coasts, where buying has been most frenzied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has been unusually hot for the past five years largely because low interest rates have allowed Americans to borrow and spend more. The National Association of Realtors forecasts that sales of new and previously owned homes will total 8.2 million in 2005, setting a record for the fifth year in a row. That would be nearly twice the 4.2 million sales recorded in 1995.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the five years through June, the nation's median house price grew at an inflation-adjusted average annual rate of 4.9%, according to the Realtors. That's triple the annual average since the real-estate trade group began compiling the data in 1968. In some places, the rise has been far greater. The median price (not adjusted for inflation) shot up 47% to $243,400 in the Phoenix area over the past 12 months, the Realtors say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How bad could the next downturn be? Optimists say that the pace of price increases will merely slow to a more sustainable level. Many economists say past drops in house prices have been recorded only in places where lots of jobs have been lost. One example is Los Angeles, hit by a rapid shrinkage of the aerospace industry in the early 1990s. In cities with strong job markets, home prices have tended to keep rising, albeit at a slower rate, when the market cooled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, history shows that house-price declines are less rare than many Realtors suggest in their sales spiels. Richard J. DeKaser, chief economist at National City Corp., a Cleveland-based banking concern, recently studied home prices in 299 metropolitan areas over the past 20 years. He found that 63 of them at some point suffered declines of 10% or more over periods of at least two years. The worst hit was Lafayette, La., where prices fell 39% in the late 1980s amid a slump in the oil industry. Honolulu, hurt by a decline in Japanese tourism, sank 20% in the late 1990s. The median decline in those 63 markets was 17%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The end of the boom isn't likely to cause a recession, however, says Mr. DeKaser of National City. He expects prices to erode in some overheated markets. But because the housing market depends so much on local conditions, prices probably will continue to rise in some places as they fall in others, diluting the effect on the national economy, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unless interest rates rise much more sharply than expected, there is no reason to expect a national housing crash, says Allen Sinai, chief global economist at Decision Economics Inc. in Boston. "I don't think this is a situation of boom-bust," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Edward Leamer, an economics professor at the University of California Los Angeles, thinks a housing downturn could "kick the economy into slow growth and possibly an outright recession." He counts 10 declines in residential investment since World War II. Eight of them, he says, provided the early warnings for recessions.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">America's economy is heavily dependent on a housing boom to offset the substantial drag on growth arising from the doubling of oil prices since spring 2004. Meanwhile, the Fed's steady rate increases, now expected to boost short-term rates above 4% by early next year, will at least slow, and perhaps reverse, the sharp rise in housing prices -- just as the Bank of England's modest 125-basis point tightening did in 2003-4. The U.K. experienced a sharp drop in consumption and growth shortly after housing began to falter. The Fed will need to engineer a carefully modulated tightening to avoid the same fate for the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The record of central banks in quelling housing bubbles over the past 15 years is not encouraging. In fact, discussions today of real estate markets in New York, L.A., Las Vegas, Miami, and other cities remind me of the stories I was hearing when I lived in Tokyo in 1988-89. Then, everyone was getting rich on real estate and prices had no place to go but up. Modest apartments in Tokyo, worth millions of dollars in 1989, remind me of stories today of the worth of modest apartments in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, there are differences between Japan's real estate boom 15 years ago and that in the U.S. today. Japan's banking system became heavily exposed to real estate investments, especially as land prices shot up. Today, American banks are less exposed to the real estate bubble, preferring instead to concentrate on fees tied to profitable mortgage originations. It is American households that are primarily exposed to a collapse of the real estate bubble in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's U.S. real estate bubble is a crucial ingredient in sustaining global demand growth for two reasons. First, demand growth is weak outside the U.S., in Europe, the U.K., China and emerging Asia. Japan has seen a modest increase in growth of domestic demand as real wages have ceased falling after a decade of weakness, but this is not sufficient to sustain global demand growth. The second and most important reason for the crucial role of the U.S. real estate bubble is that it is offsetting the drag from higher oil prices on U.S. growth. Over the past year, energy costs have imposed a drag of 1 percentage point on growth while aggressive equity extraction from housing by households has added about a percentage point to growth. The net effect is to keep growth at about 3.5% -- close to its long-run underlying trend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How vulnerable is U.S. growth to the real estate bubble? While the bubble is heavily concentrated in metropolitan areas, overall rising real estate values have contributed massively to household wealth and even to disposable income as the innovative mortgage sector arranges for easy withdrawal of rising equity in homes. The existence of a bubble in major metropolitan areas is not in doubt. The ratio of home prices to incomes is two to three standard deviations above the average since 1980 in over 20 major cities, including Miami, Chicago, San Diego, L.A., Las Vegas, San Francisco, Washington, Denver and New York. In those markets, house prices have risen by an average of over 20% during the last year; in the "hottest," Las Vegas, prices have risen by a third in a single year. Just-released U.S. home sales data shows median house prices nationwide are up nearly 15% over the last year -- triple the growth rate of incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tension in the U.S. housing sector is rising, as it did in Japan after 1989 and in the U.K. last year, because the central bank is raising interest rates. The Fed has boosted interest rates by 250 basis points over the last 14 months and is on track to continue tightening by another 75 basis points by year-end. So far, the impact of Fed tightening on the real estate sector has been limited to sporadic signs of slower price increases in some markets. This is partly because even though the Fed has raised short-term interest rates, long-term interest rates are actually lower than they were a year ago -- the famous Greenspan "conundrum."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That said, the sharp rise in short-term interest rates makes it more difficult to arrange effective low "teaser rates" that attract more spending on real estate by increasing affordability. With short-term rates rising and housing prices having risen by another 20%, affordability is becoming an increasing problem at the margin as demonstrated by the sharp increase in home prices relative to incomes in the hottest markets. The average initial payment for upscale home purchases rose by 13.4% (a 65% annual rate) during the first quarter of 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The contribution of the U.S. real estate boom to household consumption and U.S. demand growth, not to mention the U.S. construction industry, can be sharply curtailed even if price increases just drop from the current 20%-plus level to 5% or below, much as they have done in the U.K. Falling house prices are not required for housing to become a drag on growth. When prices are rising rapidly, the desired stock of housing increases as households and contractors view housing as a better and better investment. Consequently, the demand to buy houses rises and efforts by builders to develop more housing increase. After prices have risen sharply, perhaps at an increasing rate for a time, stresses begin to emerge. The higher rate signals from the central bank that it wishes the process to slowly erode affordability as house prices continue to rise. Meanwhile, rental returns fall as the stock of available rental housing that was purchased for investment rises, and the rising supply of rental property depresses rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the momentum for ever-rising prices is lost and house prices actually begin to level off, the desired stock of housing falls. Then, construction activity ceases and the rush of speculators to purchase more real estate evaporates and turns into a desire to sell. If the process is orderly, housing price inflation just falls toward zero. If it is disorderly, as was the case in Japan by 1991, house and real estate prices collapse as panicky speculators, unable to service their mortgages because of falling rents and less ability to obtain loans, start dumping properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A mere leveling of housing prices (a probable event in the coming year) would be sufficient to remove the boost from housing that is worth about 1 percentage point of growth. With that impetus eliminated and the drag from higher oil prices continuing, the U.S. growth rate could easily drop to 2.5% or lower, depending upon the future path of energy prices, the persistence of the negative impact of past energy price increases, and the sharpness of the drop in house prices. By that time, sustaining global demand growth will require more rapid demand growth from Asia and Europe. That may be difficult because those regions are suffering from a double negative: higher oil prices and weaker currencies against the dollar (in which oil is priced).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The notion that world growth is sustainable given oil at $65 a barrel because the U.S. can shrug off the implied energy drag depends almost entirely on a continued U.S. housing boom. Yet the Fed is raising interest rates, a policy move that has already quelled the housing boom in the U.K., Australia and New Zealand as it did in Japan 15 years ago. There are signs of cooling emerging already in some of the "hot" U.S. housing markets as inventories of unsold house build and rents slip on speculative properties. The Fed needs to keep moving cautiously on tightening over the year because the housing slowdown will probably arrive suddenly as speculative sentiment dies. Further, the drag from higher energy prices has risen sharply in recent weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It remains to be seen whether the final, delicate phase of such a tightening will be administered by Mr. Greenspan or his successor. President Bush will no doubt be very interested to hear from prospective Fed chairmen their plans for executing such a tricky monetary maneuver.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes in the U.S. continued at a strong pace in the second quarter, while home prices were higher across most metropolitan areas, according to a new survey.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said yesterday that existing-home sales rose 4.6% to a record 7.22 million units in the second quarter, up from the sales rate of 6.9 million units a year earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strongest increase was in West Virginia, where sales activity rose 21.7% compared with the second quarter of 2004. Washington state's existing-home sales increased 19.8%, while Vermont was up 19.6% from the year earlier. Five states and the District of Columbia posted declines. Complete data weren't available for two states.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes continued at a strong pace in the second quarter, while home prices were higher across most metropolitan areas, according to a survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low mortgage interest rates and a shortage of available homes have kept sales booming in recent years. Some economists and housing-industry analysts, however, say the shortage has been easing in many markets, which could cause home-price appreciation to slow in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said yesterday that existing-home sales rose 4.6% to a record 7.22 million units in the second quarter, up from the sales rate of 6.9 million units a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strongest increase was in West Virginia, where sales activity rose 21.7% compared with the second quarter of 2004. Washington state's existing-home sales increased 19.8%, while Vermont was up 19.6% from the year earlier. Five states and the District of Columbia posted declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Complete data weren't available for two states.</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty and Kemba Dunham  </div><div>1211 words</div><div>15 August 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes available for sale has increased sharply in some of the hottest U.S. real-estate markets -- one of several recent signs suggesting that air may be seeping out of the nation's frenzied housing market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices have surged an average of about 50% in the U.S. in the last five years, largely thanks to the lowest mortgage interest rates in more than four decades and what has been a shortage of available homes in many markets. But some economists and housing-industry analysts believe supply is catching up with demand -- a trend that could cause home-price appreciation to slow in the months ahead.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In California's San Diego County, for instance, where the median home price has more than doubled in the last five years, the number of homes listed for sale totaled 12,149 on July 8, more than twice the 5,995 available a year earlier, according to the San Diego Association of Realtors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In northern Virginia, an area dominated by the fast-growing suburbs of Washington, inventories are up 26% from a year earlier. "Sales have slowed down for sure," says Tip Powers, president of Realty Direct Inc., a Sterling, Virginia, broker. He says home prices have flattened and speculators are starting to shy away from the market because they no longer can count on quickly unloading properties at a profit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A similar rise is being seen in Massachusetts, where home inventories are up 31%, according to officials of real-estate organizations there. Real-estate brokers say inventories also are up in such markets as Chicago, Las Vegas and Orlando, Florida.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, housing demand has appeared to stall at previous moments in the boom only to pick up steam again. Judging the strength of the U.S. housing market is especially tricky in August, which is normally a slow month for home sales because so many people are on vacation. A year ago, inventories also were up at this point in the year, but supplies grew tighter in some cities later in the year and prices kept surging.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists and real-estate analysts say they won't be able to determine whether the market as a whole is slowing until September or October at the earliest and note that housing conditions vary among communities.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home builders continue to report strong sales and order backlogs in the new-home market. The National Association of Realtors recently reported that its index of pending sales in June was up 3.6% from a year earlier. (A sale is pending when a contract has been signed but the transaction hasn't been completed.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, signs of a possible peak are appearing, perhaps in part a reaction to widely publicized warnings from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan about "froth" in the housing market and a torrent of media reports about the "housing bubble."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're beginning to see that the housing market is cooling a little bit," says Mark Vitner, senior economist at Wachovia Bank in Charlotte, North Carolina, "but I stress a little bit."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors reported that 2.7 million "existing," or previously owned, homes were available for sale in June, up from 2.4 million a year earlier. At the current brisk rate of sales, the latest supply figure was enough to last 4.3 months, still considered a fairly small amount but up from 4.1 months a year earlier. If the sales rate slows, the inventory would start to look more plentiful.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're hearing from some really big Realtors that there is a little slowing [in the housing market] this month," says David Lereah, the chief economist for the Realtors' association.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If mortgage interest rates keep rising, as they have recently, home sales will slow, says Mr. Lereah. "Many times I have said housing has peaked, and I was wrong," he says. "Still, I think we've peaked and we will come down a little bit."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, builders have been putting up new homes at a breathtaking pace. New homes that either were completed or under construction totaled 354,000 in June, up from 320,000 a year before, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, many home builders say they can't keep up with demand and aren't worried about inventory levels. While they note that orders for new homes are soft in a few markets, such as Denver, South Carolina and the Washington area, there is continued strength in San Francisco, Las Vegas, Phoenix and South Florida.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, warns Ivy Zelman, a housing analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York, "If the music stops and the sales rate declines, then you're going to have a lot more supply" of new homes on the market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several factors point to a possible cooling of the market. Mortgage interest rates have been edging higher in recent weeks, raising the cost of purchasing a new home and knocking some potential buyers out of the market. The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage is 5.89%, said Freddie Mac, a mortgage-finance company, this week. That is up from 5.53% in late June.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some markets, such as California and Florida, prices have surged past the ability of many people to afford a home. Additionally, banking regulators have begun to raise questions about whether mortgage lenders are being prudent enough -- which eventually could prompt some lenders to tighten credit standards.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House prices have continued to rise partly because some lenders have promoted loans that help people buy houses they otherwise couldn't afford. For instance, Countrywide Financial Corp., the largest U.S. mortgage lender, says that about a fifth of its home loans so far this year have been "pay option" mortgages. These loans give borrowers the option of delaying any repayment of principal and even paying less than the interest due some months, which results in a rising balance due.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if regulators keep raising questions about the risks of such loans, that could push some potential home buyers out of the market, reducing demand, says Ms. Zelman.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George McCabe of Brown &amp; Partners, an advertising and public-relations firm that compiles housing data, says that, as prices continue to rise fast, more people are putting their homes on the market. "People want to cash in . . . so there is a lot of competition for resales," he says. He still sees the housing market as strong, adding: "We're just in an adjustment period."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Wachovia, Mr. Vitner says supply and demand for houses are beginning to move into better balance. "That doesn't mean prices will be a bargain," he says. "It may mean they won't continue to rise in double-digit rates."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Zelman of CSFB says that prices in some cities are likely to decline at least modestly once the housing boom ends. She noted that housing booms in the late 1980s led to falling prices a few years later in California and New England.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home sales are close to peaking but should hold historically high levels into next year, the National Association of Realtors' top economist said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chief Economist David Lereah, in a monthly forecast yesterday, nudged his estimates higher for sales of previously owned and new homes in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said existing-home sales should rise 2.9% to 6.98 million this year, up from his previous forecast of 6.97 million and higher than the 2004 record of 6.78 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes should climb 4.8% to 1.26 million in 2005, which also would be a record, the Realtors group said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing, now in a boom of more than four years, has defied economists' expectations for a slowdown this year as long-term mortgage rates remain low. That has led economists over the past two months to boost their 2005 targets and forecast another record year for sales and construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But fixed 30-year mortgage rates have begun to move higher over the past five weeks, according to mortgage-finance company Freddie Mac. Industry analysts also have begun to point to anecdotal evidence of slowing sales and rising inventory of homes available for sale in some of the priciest areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors group said home sales should begin to ease off record levels during the second half.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing market is probably close to a peak right now in terms of sales activity, but there is tremendous momentum," Mr. Lereah said. </p>

</div><div class="author">By Ruth Simon </div><div>1568 words</div><div>10 August 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AS INVESTORS FLOOD into the housing market, they are not only pushing up home prices. They are also putting downward pressure on rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growing numbers of people are buying real estate as an investment, with the intention of flipping it or moving into it later. That is increasing the supply of rental property. At the same time, low interest rates have pushed many would-be renters into becoming homeowners, thus lowering demand -- and prices -- for rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the fast-growing Phoenix area, investor demand was so strong in the first quarter that it pushed up the supply of rental homes in a number of fast-growing outlying areas, says Charles McLean, broker-owner of Century 21 Metro Alliance. In Anthem, Ariz., the number of single-family homes available for rent doubled in the first quarter versus the same period last year, he says, while average rents for those homes fell by 9%. In Gilbert, average rents for homes fell nearly 5% as the supply of rentals more than doubled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In suburban Fairfield County, Conn., a glut of properties has pushed rents for homes down by roughly 20%, estimates David D'Ausilio, the broker-owner of Re/Max Results. "It used to be pretty rare to see a single-family house for rent," he says. But with more people investing in real estate, "there are now a large number of rentals."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Competition among condominium investors in San Diego is so keen that many have been forced to throw in a month's free rent, lower their standards for who is an acceptable tenant and even toss in incentives such as a free gym membership, says Robert Griswold, owner of Griswold Real Estate Management. "You've got a lot of mom-and-pop people putting signs in the window," says Mr. Griswold. "These are brand-new, nice places, but the caliber of the rental pool is such that [renters] are able to get good deals."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing analysts say the growth of investor-owned properties represents a "shadow" supply of rental units that doesn't show up in traditional rental-market measures. In fact, rents are expected to rise an average of 1.2% nationally in 2005, according to Property &amp;Portfolio Research Inc., which tracks 54 markets. But a surplus of investor-owned properties is dragging down rents in certain segments of the market in a number of places, including Las Vegas, South Florida and Kansas City. The effects are greatest where many investors have purchased similar properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next year, as more condos purchased by investors come onto the rental market, the pressure on rents could become more noticeable. There are already strong indications that the number of investor-owned rentals are rising. The vacancy rate for one-unit rentals, typically owned by investors, stood at 9.7% in the second quarter, up from 8.7% in the same period last year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Vacancy rates for multifamily homes and apartment buildings fell during that time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of vacant single-family homes for rent now stands at a record 1.339 million, says Rick Murray, an analyst for Raymond James &amp;Associates. In a report issued in April, Mr. Murray called the "hidden inventory" of single-family rental homes a sign of "irrational investment decisions." It could increase the supply of homes for sale and "exert downward pressure on prices," he wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For consumers, rising home prices and soft rents have made renting a bargain compared to owning in many markets. Some of the best deals can be had by renting from an individual investor. But there are tradeoffs. The landlord may not do as good a job on maintenance, or may show up unannounced to check on the property. Some investors use real-estate agents or property managers to find tenants; others use classified ads and Web listings or hang a sign in the window.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increased competition for renters is the latest sign of how investors are putting their stamp on the housing market. During the first four months of 2005, investors accounted for nearly 10% of mortgages taken out to buy homes, according to LoanPerformance, a unit of First American Corp., up from less than 6% in 2001. Many builders have taken steps to limit sales to investors, in part because they fear these units could quickly return to the market if prices soften.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speculation has played a key role in pushing home prices higher in many hot markets, economists say. The median price for an existing home climbed 14.7% in June versus the same period last year, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, not every home or condo purchased by an investor winds up as a rental. Some investors quickly flip their properties; others keep them off the market, fearing a tenant could reduce the resale value of a new home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the growth in home prices slows or stalls, the number of investor-owned units could swell as speculators find it tougher to flip their properties. At the same time, some investors who have been renting out their properties -- but earning little or no monthly profit -- might decide to unload their holdings and cut their losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many markets, investors who do rent out their properties are finding it tough to turn a profit on a cash-flow basis. David Bessette, CEO of All Florida Realty Services Inc., has had to drop the monthly rents for some of the three-bedroom units he manages in Palm Coast, Fla., to $850 from $1,100 because the supply is so great. Even so, it's still taking six to eight months to rent these units, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Kansas City, rents have dropped to an average of 0.75% of the home's purchase price or appraised value from 1% five years ago, says Debby Barash, rental services manager for Reece &amp;Nichols, a unit of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. "The increased number of single-family rental properties is one factor contributing to the softening of rental rates," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's not true in all markets. "When I have a rental vacancy, I run an ad for one day and I get overwhelmed by qualified people," says Larry Robillard, a broker with Re/Max All Stars Realty in Riverside, Calif. In Newport News, Va., "the market is so tight we're just desperate for inventory of any kind," says Liz Moore, president of Liz Moore &amp;Associates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many areas, owners of rental properties are benefiting as developers turn apartment buildings into condos, reducing the rental supply. In the last 18 months, developers have purchased more than 127,000 apartment units for condo conversions, according to Real Capital Analytics, a research and consulting firm in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the surge in condo developments is a "double-edged sword," says Michael Cohen, senior real estate economist with Property &amp;Portfolio Research. While condo conversions reduce the stock of rentals, some units are bought by investors who plan to rent them out, he notes. New construction is also adding to the supply of condos -- and the number of units that might enter the rental market. Mr. Cohen estimates that roughly 78,000 newly built condo and townhouse units will be ready for occupancy this year and another 118,000 in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pressures are most apparent when new projects are ready for occupancy. In Las Vegas, investors were forced to cut prices, offer a month's free rent and referral fees of up to $500 -- versus the $200 or so that is common -- when two condo projects came on line earlier this year, says Linda Rheinberger, president-elect of the Greater Las Vegas Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Hadzicki, an technology executive in San Diego, spent about $190,000 a piece for two condominium units in one Las Vegas project. It took two months to find a tenant, says Mr. Hadzicki, who cut his asking rent twice, to $795 a month from $875. "It was a little difficult because there was a lot of property that came on at the same time," he says. Mr. Hadzicki figures he's losing about $135 a month on each property, but will more than make up for the losses when it's time to sell.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coachella, Calif. -- FROM MONDAY to Friday, Guillermina and Refugio Cuevas pick and pack grapes for a living. On weekends, each dons a tool belt and takes up a hammer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not for extra cash. In their spare time, the Cuevases are building houses for themselves and 11 other families -- a dozen single-family homes in a row -- not far from chic Palm Springs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are all participants in a little-known federal program that finances homes in rural areas for low-income families. The act of home building, deemed "sweat equity," accounts for 10% to 15% of the value of each new home and serves as the down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The program promises a dramatic lifestyle change for the Cuevases and their four children, who for nine years have rented a cockroach-infested apartment in an agricultural labor camp. Amid escalating property prices, homeownership seemed further from reach with each passing year. The Cuevases' combined annual income is just $25,000, while the average price of homes in the area is between $300,000 and $350,000, according to the city's building department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, the couple learned they had qualified for the "mutual self-help program" run by the Coachella Valley Housing Coalition, a local nonprofit developer, and funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. In eight months, they hope to move into their four-bedroom house, complete with central air conditioning. The prospect of "owning a house gives me much fulfillment," said Mrs. Cuevas, as she put the final touches on a house's framing in the 100-degree heat of a recent Saturday morning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Cuevas wasn't even working on her own house; hers is down the street. Instead, she was erecting the home of Carmen and Carlos Meza, another couple in the program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each participating family contributes at least 40 hours of labor weekly over 10 to 12 months until all houses in their group are completed. The developer employs a building supervisor who trains the families and assigns them construction jobs. All told, the families do about two-thirds of the labor; air conditioning, plumbing and stucco are among the tasks left for licensed specialists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reminiscent of Amish barn-raising, community home building marries self-reliance with group effort. Some USDA officials say it recalls the Homestead Act of 1862, when Abraham Lincoln gave settlers -- many of them immigrants -- a 160-acre tract on which to build and plant with the intention of populating the frontier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides funding construction of the houses, the USDA offers the families mortgages. But it offloads some of the work to local community groups, like the Coachella Valley coalition. The local partners are responsible for finding tracts to develop, screening applicants for the program, training participants and supervising construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Coachella Valley coalition builds about 150 single-family houses each year in Riverside and Imperial counties. The Cuevas family waited four years to get into the program. The housing coalition's staff interviewed the couple, verified their employment history and checked their credit record, among other things. Once accepted, the Cuevases received construction training and a financial-planning course for first-time homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Considered high-risk borrowers, working-class families like the Cuevases have little chance of being approved for a regular mortgage; they also can't afford to make a down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet it's precisely these working-class families that the USDA program targets. To qualify, a family's annual income can be no more than 80% of the area's median income. The interest rate on their home loans ranges from 1% up to the going market rate, depending on family income. "This isn't a giveaway," says Russell Davis, administrator of housing for USDA rural development. "These families make mortgage payments and pay taxes." The default rate hovers around 2% to 3%, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Cuevases are likely to make monthly mortgage payments of about $650 on a mortgage of $111,000 with a preferential interest rate, which will be determined when the house is completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On average, each year the USDA disburses about $200 million in mortgages for about 1,500 families in 40 states participating in the self-help scheme. In the past 10 years, the cost of running the program, exclusive of mortgages, has tripled in size to $34 million annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The program targets minorities to further President Bush's mission to boost minority homeownership, according to the USDA. In Coachella, the overwhelming majority of participants are Latinos, who toil in the fields, hotels and restaurants in the Palm Springs area. Participants must be legal residents of the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another goal of the USDA program is to breathe new life into communities suffering from an exodus of their young to urban areas. Thanks to the program, development is happening in Great Plains states, such as North Dakota and Kansas, where there hasn't been much new housing stock for 50 years, Mr. Davis says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Davis says the USDA wants to expand the program in some underserved areas. But soaring land prices are becoming an obstacle in states like California and Nevada. Local groups, such as the Coachella Valley coalition, compete with for-profit developers for land. And in some towns, new homeowners must contend with property taxes that run nearly as high as mortgage payments, according to Paul Venosdel, California director for USDA rural development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coachella Valley Housing Coalition's executive director, John Mealey, had to tap the state of California for extra funding and Wells Fargo &amp;Co. for financing to acquire the land and build initial infrastructure, such as streets and sidewalks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Coachella, the total budget for erecting Paseo de Las Palmas, the development where the Cuevas will live, is $17.2 million. The average price of the three- and four-bedroom houses is $147,000; city building inspector Lizandro Diaz estimates that their market value is close to $300,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, "the families in the project aren't thinking about property appreciation," says Mr. Mealey. "They're thinking about a place for their kids to grow up and do their homework." He says families are meticulous about maintaining their homes and rarely sell them. (If a family sells its home, it is required to repay the interest credit received from the USDA, which is the difference between a ceiling interest rate set by the agency and the actual interest the family paid.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Paseo de Las Palmas, the houses look like typical middle-class tract housing, with two-car garages, tile roofs and stucco finish. Mr. Diaz, the building inspector, says the workmanship is often better than what he finds in developments built by contractors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, 126 families will live in Paseo de las Palmas when it's completed early next year. So far, 42 families have moved into the development, which boasts a stunning view of the Santa Rosa Mountains. Last month, Maria and Gubenal Madrigal occupied a three-bedroom, eggshell-white house whose entrance is lined with colorful flowers. Their sons, Aaron, 8 years old, and Jacob, 6, quickly recite the reasons they love their new home: more room inside, a yard for barbequing and a sidewalk for biking.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DALLAS -- After scoring big gains at home, and then in Phoenix and Las Vegas, California real-estate investors are arriving in Texas, betting that the Lone Star state's tepid home market is finally about to turn around.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, out-of-towners have been buying office buildings and other commercial property in Texas. Now, a small but increasing number of investors are snatching up new and previously owned homes in the cities of Austin and Dallas for bargain prices compared with those in sizzling U.S. West Coast markets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some investors see potential for hefty price appreciation in select neighborhoods; others view the state's metropolitan areas as a haven for their investment dollars. Though their arrival signals that Texas' fortunes may be improving, it also may be an acknowledgment that the heady years of skyrocketing home values along the West Coast may be ending. The best new prospect out there may be slow but steady growth in Texas.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the inside, Texas doesn't seem like inviting ground for residential investment. Job growth is crawling along at 1.2%, below the national rate. The state economy still is smarting from the 2001 recession. And the abundance of land provides ample room for growth, which tends to damp prices. While median home prices throughout the U.S. have climbed 32% from 2000 to 2004, prices in Dallas rose just 13%, according to the National Association of Realtors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So while a new four-bedroom house can be had for $150,000, or about 121,500 euros, on the expanding outskirts of Dallas, the fifth-largest metropolitan area in the U.S., that price has barely budged in recent years. In the first quarter, Texas homes appreciated 3.77%, the lowest rate in the U.S., according to the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, to outsiders, Texas looks ripe for investment. "As a real-estate investor, you look for things that have just started to turn around, not for things that are booming," says Bruce Norris, president of Norris Group, a real-estate investment firm in Riverside, California. Mr. Norris accurately predicted in 1997 that California housing prices would double by 2005. Now he is staking a new claim on the Dallas-Forth Worth area. Dallas is "perfectly poised" for a takeoff in the next five years, he says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Norris and other investors believe foreclosures, which have risen only 4% from last year, are peaking, which makes it the perfect time to buy. They are banking on the Texas economy pulling out of its slump, as the low cost of living here and bargain real estate attracts more businesses and people to the state, stimulating growth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already there are signs of that happening. Consider the U-Haul gauge. Moving-truck provider U-Haul International Inc. has so many more trucks going to Dallas than leaving it that it charges more than twice as much for a one-way trip from Anaheim, California, to Dallas than for a trip going the opposite way. Investors see that as an indicator of increasing housing demand.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dallas -- THE CALIFORNIANS are coming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After scoring big gains at home, and then in Phoenix and Las Vegas, California real-estate investors are arriving in the Lone Star state betting that Texas' tepid home market is finally about to turn around.</p>

While median home prices nationwide have climbed 32% from 2000 to 2004, prices in Dallas were up just 13%, according to the National Association of Realtors. Meanwhile, prices skyrocketed 98% in Anaheim, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SO WHILE a new four-bedroom house can be had for $150,000 on the expanding outskirts of Dallas, the fifth-largest metropolitan area in the country, that price has barely budged in recent years. In the first quarter of 2005, Texas homes appreciated at 3.77%, the lowest rate in the nation, according to the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state's population boom won't help much, either, says Jim Gaines, a research economist at Texas A&amp;M Real Estate Center. Many of the newcomers are immigrants whose cheap labor is helping hold down building costs and whose wages don't support higher home prices anyway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To outsiders, however, Texas looks ripe for investment. "As a real-estate investor, you look for things that have just started to turn around, not for things that are booming," says Bruce Norris, president of the Norris Group, a real-estate investment firm in Riverside, Calif. Mr. Norris accurately predicted in 1997 that California housing prices would double by 2005. Now he is staking a new claim on the Dallas-Forth Worth area. In September, he is taking a group of 50 California investors on a home-buying spree here. Dallas is "perfectly poised" for a takeoff in the next five years, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five years ago, the Dallas economy, like much of Texas, hit the skids as technology companies slashed employment here. Home prices stagnated in most communities and even fell in northern suburbs where many of the unemployed tech workers lived. The result: Foreclosure listings skyrocketed. In the first eight months of 2005, 21,119 homes were listed for foreclosure, up 58% from the same period in 2002, according to the Dallas-based Foreclosure Listing Service Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Norris and other investors believe foreclosures, which have risen only 4% from last year, are peaking, which makes it the perfect time to buy. They are banking on the Texas economy pulling out of its slump as the low cost of living here and bargain real estate attracts more businesses and people to the state, stimulating more growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ALREADY, THERE are signs of that happening as people flee from inflated prices elsewhere. Consider the U-Haul gauge. U-Haul International Inc., the moving-truck company, has so many more trucks going to Dallas than leaving it that it charges more than twice as much for a one-way trip from Anaheim, Calif., to Dallas than for a trip going the opposite way. Investors see that as one indicator of increasing housing demand, which they believe will buoy prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A couple of years ago, Richard Brazil moved his family from Camarillo, Calif., into a new five-bedroom home in a Dallas suburb. The 3,000-square-foot house was more than twice as big, and cost less than a third of the value of his home in Calif. "Getting off the plane and seeing a house that big and that new, it just blew my mind. The price is like 10 times cheaper than California," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brazil invested in two more rental homes in nearby cities. He still commutes to California for work, but he says soon he will settle down in Dallas, relying on his investments here to help fund his twilight years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Dallas is basically my retirement," Mr. Brazil says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neil Barsky notes in his July 28 op-ed "What Housing Bubble?" that he is not an economist, which is confirmed when he writes, "What we do have is a serious housing shortage . . ." The "shortage" hypothesis is often used in several contexts by the press. National media have reported shortages of engineers, business faculty, teachers, nurses and a host of other professionals. Proponents of these shortages, however, overlook fundamental economic principles. They speak of shortages as though shortages represent some absolute, readily identifiable lack of desirable goods and services. Price is seldom accorded its proper role.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is never enough of any good or service to satisfy all wants or desires. The consumer must give up something to get something. The buyer must pay the market price and forego whatever else he could have for the same price. The forces of supply and demand determine these prices -- and the price of housing is no exception. The buyer can take it or leave it. However, those who choose to leave it (because of lack of funds or personal preference) must not cry shortage. The good is available at the market price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All goods and services are scarce, but scarcity and shortages are by no means synonymous. Scarcity is a regrettable and unavoidable fact. Shortages are purely a function of price. The only way in which a shortage has existed, or ever will exist, is in cases where the "going price" has been held below the market-clearing price. Evidence does not suggest that such is the case for the "shortages" which have recently been advanced.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neil Barsky's points were refreshing considering all the hand-wringing over the recent appreciation of home prices. Although prices have risen, there are good reasons. Certainly the 24% drop in mortgage rates since 1999 has been an important factor, and has allowed for greater access to homeownership for a larger portion of the population, but there have been other real and fundamental reasons for the rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, the average square footage of new homes built has risen 9%, so though we are paying more for our homes, we are also getting larger living spaces. Or, average hourly wages have increased 17%. It can be argued that home prices are catching up to wages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And just because home prices have risen is no reason to assume that they are poised to fall dramatically, even in very hot markets. The last time we saw a 13%+ increase in the average new home price was in 1987 and for the next three years prices rose on average 5.4% before finally declining a modest 1.8% in 1991. The downturn lasted one year and in 1992 they began a 14-year up cycle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, an increasing percentage of new homes built every year are being built by large, well-capitalized, more risk-averse builders who have been leveraging size to get land, labor and materials at better prices then smaller builders are able. Though housing remains cyclical, the public builders have improved their business models in the past 15 years, relying more on optioned land and access to cheaper capital. As a result they have seen their market share more then double and their share prices appreciate an average of 3,000% since 1990.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have spent a good part of the past four years listening to the media and some in the investing community warn investors to avoid housing stocks because of the "housing bubble." Some day, they may be right. But while they were spending so much time clucking about the sky falling, they were missing the fundamentals on the ground all around them -- and a lot of excellent investing opportunities to boot.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Barsky's article overlooks several arguments. Historically, the prices in hot markets with household incomes misalign with rents on comparable properties. There is also the role of transitory demand in creating the illusion of a supply shortage, fueled by unsustainably low mortgage rates, speculation and loose credit standards. And he neglects the relationship between rising central bank interest rates and mortgage rates, which has already brought an end to the British housing bubble and will likely soon have a similar effect here.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Zachary A. Goldfarb </div><div>580 words</div><div>2 August 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. factory activity in July picked up for the second consecutive month, suggesting the manufacturing sector is continuing to gain momentum after hitting a soft spot late last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management, in a survey of more than 400 companies, said its July index of manufacturing activity rose to 56.6 from 53.8 in June, driven by new orders and higher production levels as well as lower prices. Any figure above 50 represents growth in the sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Manufacturing has regained its footing," said National Association of Manufacturers chief economist David Huether.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in factory activity is another sign that the economy may pick up speed in the third quarter. Recent Commerce Department figures indicated strong consumer demand, which surprised manufacturers and led them to draw down inventories to meet sales. Now they are increasing production as more orders arrive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The improvement may be more evidence for the Federal Reserve that it needs to raise short-term interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating. On the other hand, lower prices may assuage inflation fears that could lead to higher rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After growing unusually quickly for part of 2004, the manufacturing sector saw its rate of growth slow down for the seven months starting last November, raising concerns about whether it would see contraction. But in June it picked up again, and with July's increase, "all the signs are that we should have continued momentum through the second half of the year," said ISM's Norbert Ore, the Tempe, Ariz., group's chairman. He cautioned that growth could slow if oil prices continue to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twelve manufacturing sectors showed growth in the latest report, including the fabricated metals, wood and furniture industries. Mr. Ore said recent initiatives by automotive companies to make employee-pricing available to consumers and the hot housing market were having benefits "down the supply chain," leading to a jump in demand for many of the components for cars and homes. Six industries, including apparel and paper, reported decreased activity last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other economic news, the Commerce Department said construction spending declined in June, and May's figures were revised downward. Total spending in June slid 0.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.093 trillion, while May saw a 1.7% decrease to $1.096 trillion, rather than the originally projected 0.9% decrease to $1.103 trillion. Both the June and revised May figures are above what was registered a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most significant decline was in residential construction spending, which fell 0.4% to $609.1 billion. Spending on public nonresidential construction, such as schools and highways, declined 0.5% to $242.4 billion, though spending on private nonresidential construction, such as offices and factories, grew 0.2% to $241.4 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the National Association of Realtors said its pending-home-sales index in June rose 0.6% from a month earlier to 126.3. The index, which equates the 2001 level of activity to 100, is based on the number of pending sales of previously owned homes for which contracts have been signed but transactions aren't completed. The index was up 3.6% from a year earlier.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. factory activity picked up last month, a private research group reported, as new orders and production rose, hiring perked up and price pressures eased.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, U.S. construction spending turned down unexpectedly during June, taking its fourth consecutive drop as residential outlays slid in spite of the hot housing market. Total spending decreased 0.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.093 trillion, the Commerce Department said. Spending fell 1.7% in May to $1.096 trillion; it was originally reported as down 0.9% at $1.103 trillion.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management said its July index of manufacturing activity rose to a reading of 56.6 from the 53.8 reading posted in June. Any index reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It appears that the sector hit a low point in May, and has rebounded nicely in June and July," said Norbert Ore, chairman of the ISM's manufacturing survey committee. He noted that new orders, which rose to a reading of 60.6 from 57.2 in June, and production, which jumped from 55.6 to a robust 61.2 reading in July, continued to drive improvement in the sector. An index of employment rose to 53.2 after coming in at 49.9 in June.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The survey is clearly signaling an end to the industrial slowdown," Ian Shepherdson of High Frequency Economics wrote in a note to the research firm's clients. "With consumers happy, too, this is a great start" to the third quarter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An index of prices in the ISM's report slid into negative territory, registering a reading of 48.5 after coming in at 50.5 in June. Mr. Ore said July's reading "indicates that pricing power, at least for the short term, is now once again favoring buyers." The move below 50 in the price index closes 40 straight months of rising inflation pressures for manufacturers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM also said inventories continued to contract, at a July reading of 47.5, compared with 47.8 in both June and May.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Today's Market Forecast]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared With What?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By most measures, it is hard to argue that stocks are anything close to cheap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A valuation model devised by Yale University's Robert Shiller compares the price of the Standard &amp;Poor's 500-stock index with average annual earnings, under generally accepted accounting principles. The Shiller price/earnings ratio of 29 is well below the peak of 48 hit in December 1999. But before late 1996 -- around when Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan made his "irrational exuberance" speech -- it never was as high as it is now. At the start of the long bull market that began in 1982, it was 11.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A measure from Jim Bianco of Arbor Research, which compares the capitalization of the stock market to gross domestic product, tells a similar story. At 120%, market cap as a percentage of GDP is below the 183% it hit in early 2000. Still, this measure was never north of 100% before early 1997 and was at 33.5% at the start of the bull market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the least, the market's high valuation by these measures suggests stocks might not offer much in the way of returns in the years to come. Stocks can go higher only if valuations (like P/Es) go higher or if earnings go higher. It is easier to imagine valuations falling to historic norms than it is to imagine them making another 1990s-style push higher. That leaves earnings, which over time can't grow much faster than GDP, to push stocks higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some bullish strategists say stocks actually are cheap, because interest rates are so low. Bears respond that, at the very least, this only means that stocks are cheap compared with interest-bearing instruments, such as Treasurys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houses, on the other hand, don't look cheap compared with almost anything. The National Association of Realtors' Housing Affordability Index measures how easy it is, at current mortgage rates, for a family with an average income to afford an average house. In June, it fell to its least-affordable level since August 1991, when mortgage rates were significantly higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An unscientific email sampling Friday of short-sellers and other bearishly inclined investors asked respondents what they would prefer to sink $500,000 into for the next three years, a Florida condo or the Nasdaq-100 Index Tracking Stock exchange-traded fund, better known by its symbol QQQQ, which these people tend to think of as a proxy for speculative excess.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The QQQQ won, hands down.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors' love affair with real estate is producing a record year for U.S. commercial mortgage-backed securities, signaling a further shift in real-estate financing from banks to Wall Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash is flooding into the market, where mortgages for skyscrapers, strip malls and other commercial properties are bundled together and sold as bonds to investors from pension funds and insurance companies to hedge funds and wealthy investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That strong demand, however, is driving down the yields investors receive. Some bankers fear the rush into the bonds may even loosen lending standards, allowing real-estate buyers to borrow more and thus drive up property prices. In other words, investors could be putting themselves at risk if their zealousness to lend by purchasing mortgage bonds causes property buyers to overreach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What is supporting real-estate prices?" asks Rob Brennan, who runs Credit Suisse First Boston's real-estate finance and securitization group. "It's the availability of competitively priced debt. That's thanks to the public [commerical mortgage securities] market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate owners borrowed $72 billion, or about 60 billion euros, through commercial mortgage-backed issues debt in the first half of 2005, compared with a record $94 billion for all of 2004, according to the Commercial Real Estate Securities Association. The commercial mortgage-backed securities market has grown tenfold during the past decade, with about $500 billion of securities outstanding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"CMBS is slowly eating away market share from traditional real-estate lenders like banks and life-insurance companies," said John Westerfield, a <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> managing director responsible for real-estate lending. That may be why traditional lenders <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Wachovia Corp</span>. now also happen to run the leading commercial mortgage-backed securities' operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sam Zell, a well-known real-estate investor and chairman of <span class="companylink">Equity Office Properties Trust</span>, the biggest office-building owner in the U.S., believes that the commercial mortgage-backed securities market has removed some of the clubbiness in the industry, allowing people to raise funds even if they don't have relationships with bankers. "It's made the overall commercial real-estate market more viable to everybody," Mr. Zell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For investors, the insatiable thirst for yield in a low-yield world is driving much of the demand. While yields on the issues have fallen, they still offer higher payouts than most government and corporate bonds. With so many players flooding the commercial mortgage-backed issues market, returns for investors also are less rewarding than in the past: According to <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span>, the yield on a single-A-rated commercial mortgage-backed securities dropped to 5.23% from 5.88% three years ago, while the yield premium the bonds pay above U.S. Treasury securities dropped to one percentage point from 1.35 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People are taking more risk for less reward," said Ken Cohen, a <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> managing director who puts together commercial mortgage-backed securities deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The yield advantage to other bonds is still attractive enough for many investors. <span class="companylink">Putnam Investments</span>, for example, now holds commercial mortgage-backed issues in more than 10% of its active accounts, compared with less than 1% two years ago. "As long as [yield] spreads stay where they are, we're going to be heavily involved," said Rob Bloemker, managing director and team leader of the mortgage-backed securities and government group for Putnam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which is why some in the industry fear that real-estate owners will keep borrowing more, a real problem should the property-market pull back. But it isn't just property buyers that are piling in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The real pressure is coming from the developers," said Mark Finerman, who heads the real-estate finance group for RBS Greenwich Capital. Indeed, gung-ho developers can get a loan to break ground on a new building in Manhattan for as little as a 5% down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commercial mortgage-backed issues market grew out of the <span class="companylink">Resolution Trust Corp</span>., which was created to sell off assets of failed savings-and-loan institutions in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The RTC issued nearly $15 billion of commercial mortgages, which Wall Street firms soon found a way to turn into bonds, with each bond divided into individual "tranches" that allow buyers to pick their preferred level of risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conventional developers were slow to adopt commercial mortgage-backed issues financing. They already had age-old relationships with traditional bankers and insurance companies. While commercial mortgage-backed issues offered better rates, developers disliked the restrictions against paying off debts early and making changes to buildings and having less contact with bankers. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The real pressure is coming from the developers," said Mark Finerman, who heads the real-estate finance group for RBS Greenwich Capital.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The CMBS market grew out of the <span class="companylink">Resolution Trust Corp</span>., which was created to sell off assets of failed savings-and-loan institutions in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But conventional developers were slow to adopt CMBS financing. They already had age-old relationships with traditional bankers and insurance companies.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We stayed away from them for years," said Gentry Hoit, executive vice president of capital transactions for national office landlord Shorenstein Co.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After slowing their pace of investment earlier this year, U.S. companies are showing signs of placing bigger bets on equipment like industrial machines, airplanes and computer gear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That sign of rising confidence among business executives could point to a pickup in overall economic growth in the second half of the year. High oil prices and uncertainty about the global economy had left some economists worried the recovery in business investment could falter, but a wide array of recent reports suggests that investment, like consumer spending, is back on solid footing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Intel Corp., Boeing Co., and General Electric Co. are among the companies that have reported robust demand for their products in the past few days and weeks. The Federal Reserve said yesterday that its "beige book" -- a compilation of anecdotal reports on the economic outlook from its 12 regional Fed banks -- showed upbeat expectations for factory activity across the nation. Dallas, for example, reported demand for semiconductors had picked up in the past six weeks, while Cleveland said Midwest manufacturers were seeing rising orders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department lent weight to these anecdotal reports with a monthly release showing that new orders for manufactured durable goods -- products like cars, computers and industrial machinery -- were on the rise. They increased in June by $2.9 billion, or 1.4%, to $215.4 billion, up 6.8% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists watch durable-goods orders closely because they are considered an indicator of future economic activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gains in April and May had been driven by surging orders for airplanes and parts. But the latest report showed a solid underpinning outside that sector. New orders for capital goods other than aircraft and defense -- a closely watched proxy for underlying investment demand -- rose to nearly $69 billion in June, up 3.8% from the month before and 11.1% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The numbers were somewhat stronger than expected [and] very broad-based," said Joel L. Naroff, president and chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors. "This seems to indicate a fair amount of [business] confidence out there." It also indicates that business investment is "likely to stay solid the rest of the year," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other indicators suggest the industrial sector and business investment were gathering steam as they entered the second half of the year. Early this month, for instance, the Institute for Supply Management said its monthly survey of supply managers rebounded in June, in part because of a surge in new orders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at Global Insight, a Waltham, Mass., economic-forecasting firm, says executives have been heartened by the economy's resilience in the face of rising oil prices. Businesses also have worked off inventory that built up earlier in the year, he noted. He now expects the economy to expand by as much as 3.8% in the second half, up from an earlier projection of 3.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday, Boeing attributed a 15% increase in second-quarter revenue to strong global growth, and other companies have made similar pronouncements. Ingersoll-Rand Co., a manufacturer of industrial equipment, last week boosted its full-year earnings guidance, citing strong orders. General Electric reported double-digit orders gains for the second quarter. "It is about as good as I would hope for," Andy Bryant, Intel's chief financial officer, said after announcing a 15% increase in second-quarter revenue last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other reports showed the economy firing on many cylinders. The Commerce Department reported that sales of new, single-family houses in June rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of nearly 1.4 million units, a record, up 4% from the month before and 14% from a year ago. Economists took it as yet another sign that the housing boom continues, though the median sales price of new homes fell in June to $214,800, down 5.5% from the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price decline didn't necessarily mean sales prices were faltering. It could instead mean that modestly priced homes were gaining market share, noted Michael Carliner, an economist at the National Association of Home Builders in Washington. Overall, new homes priced at $300,000 and above accounted for 29% of total sales in June, down from 33% in May, according to the Commerce Department. New homes priced between $150,000 to $199,999 accounted for 25%, up from 21% in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has been clear for several weeks now that consumer spending and housing were on a firm footing as the economy moved into the second half. Less certain was the outlook for business investment, which showed some signs of slowing a few months ago -- growing in the first quarter at a 4.1% annual rate, according to the Commerce Department, the slowest pace since early 2003. And orders for durables goods declined during the first three months of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say the slowdown was partly tied to the expiration of tax incentives last year, which encouraged businesses to make investments in 2004 while the incentives still applied. The latest reports indicated that businesses have shrugged off uncertainties and are poised to resume robust spending on equipment, economists say.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you want to be scared out of your wits these days, you basically have two choices: go watch Steven Spielberg's latest, or listen to the hysterical warnings of economists and journalists about the imminent popping of our so-called housing bubble. Robert Shiller, the ubiquitous Yale economist, says home prices could fall 50% from their peak. Taking things a step further, The Economist recently went so far as to call the global housing boom "the biggest bubble in history."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a free country, it is fair game for the media and economists to scare homeowners with words of gloom and doom, however knee-jerk, consensual and misguided they may be. But housing is a serious business; for most of us, it is our most valuable asset. For generations of immigrants, home ownership has represented the realization of the American dream.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reality is this: There is no housing bubble in this country. Our strong housing market is a function of myriad factors with real economic underpinnings: low interest rates, local job growth, the emotional attachment one has for one's home, one's view of one's future earning-power, and parental contributions, all have done their part to contribute to rising home prices. Over the past quarter-century, there has been an explosion of second-home purchases, a continued influx of immigrants, and a significant reduction in existing housing inventory through tear-downs. Not all of these trends are accurately reflected in the unending stream of data published daily. Home prices on average have risen at a 6% annual pace since 1999, and 13% over the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What we do have is a serious housing shortage and housing affordability crisis. Despite robust construction, unsold inventory stands at four months, well below its 25-year average. Private builders complain they can't get land permitted to meet demand. Low-income housing advocates complain housing prices are out of reach for many Americans, and that government subsidies have been slashed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I am not an economist, though if you keep reading, you'll find I can use selective data points to my advantage with the best of them. I was a real estate reporter for this newspaper through several real estate crises, as well as a Wall Street REIT analyst; I am now a money manager. I currently own stocks in several homebuilders; so I am putting my money where my mouth is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, over the past 25 years we have seen numerous real estate busts. However, steep price declines have typically been driven by local economic factors -- oil woes lead to weakness in Texas in the '80s; aerospace and defense layoffs soften up prices in LA in the '90s; a contraction on Wall Street hurts New York co-op prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What we have never seen in this country is a collapse of home prices without also seeing local economic weakness or significant capacity growth. Absent those factors, housing markets just don't collapse under their own weight. Herewith are some of the myths put forth by the housing bubble Chicken Littles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Myth GBP 1. There is too much capacity: According to Census data, over the past 10 years, housing permits have averaged about 1.63 million units per year -- including multifamily units. Household formation has averaged 1.49 million families per year. So far, so good. But here is where the data gets murky. Roughly 6% of the new home sales were for second homes (I have seen estimates that the number is actually twice as high), according to UBS. And while there are no precise numbers on this, approximately 360,000 units every year were torn down either because they were nonfunctional, or because they were "tear-downs." When the latter two numbers are taken into account, the real number of new homes is closer to 1.2 million, or 19% fewer than the average number of new households formed each year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Myth GBP 2. Risky mortgage products are fueling house appreciation: Sages from Warren Buffett to Alan Greenspan have warned of the increased risk from the use of new mortgage products, particularly adjustable-rate mortgages and interest-only mortgages. The theory here is that buyers are extending themselves to make payments, and when their mortgages reset they will be in trouble. Put aside the fact that only a year ago Mr. Greenspan was advocating the use of ARMs ("American consumers might benefit if lenders provided greater mortgage product alternatives to the traditional fixed-rate mortgage," he told the Credit Union National Association last year), these concerns are wildly overstated. As virtually every mortgagee in the country knows, most ARMs are fixed rate for the first two to seven years. Virtually all have 2% interest-rate caps. The average American owns his home for seven years. Why pay several hundred basis points to lock in rates he is highly unlikely to take advantage of? Moreover, very little equity has been paid off by a homeowner in the first seven years of a 30-year loan, so consumers have been effectively overspending on interest rates for generations. As Mr. Greenspan said in his 2004 speech, "the traditional fixed-rate mortgage may be an expensive method of financing a home."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Myth GBP 3. Speculators are Driving Home Prices: The media today is chock-full of stories of day-trading dot-com refugees who have found their calling buying homes and condos "on spec," with the hope of flipping the property for a higher price. Earlier this month, one Wall Street analyst published an article with the catchy headline: "Investors Gone Wild: An Analysis of Real Estate Speculation." Scary stuff. Here, again, some common-sense thinking is in order. In Manhattan, where I live, friends buy apartments kicking and screaming, convinced they top-ticked the housing market. Is Manhattan special? Are speculators flipping Palm Beach mansions? Bay Area three-bedroom homes? Newton, Mass., Tudor homes? I don't think so. Yet these markets are experiencing the same price appreciation as Las Vegas, Phoenix and Florida, where real estate investors are supposedly driving prices higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyone waiting for prices to collapse before buying a home is likely to be in for a disappointment. According to the Homeownership Alliance, new household formation, replacement demand and second-home demand will require about two million homes per year to be built over the next decade. This year, the number is likely to be around two million, the highest number since the 1970s -- even as the number of households has grown by over 50% since 1975. Therefore, there is a large cumulative deficit in housing that will take years to correct even if annual housing starts continue at these record levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the cynical, it is seductive to claim that every piece of good news is a bit fraudulent. And real estate has certainly been subject to boom and bust cycles. But bubbles happen when prices become unhinged from intrinsic value. Homes are not stocks; their "intrinsic value" can only be in the eye of the beholder. A house has utility. Rational people might be willing to pay more for a water view, or for living close to work, or for a larger loo. Such voluntary economic decisions are neither irrational nor exuberant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's time to stop being alarmist about home prices. To the extent policy makers want to modulate home-price appreciation, they would do well to relax zoning laws, or stimulate development of low-income housing through tax subsidies. Since those things are not likely to happen overnight, housing prices are likely to cool off slowly, if at all.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Christine Haughney   </div><div>961 words</div><div>28 July 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">INVESTORS' LOVE AFFAIR with real estate is producing a record year for commercial mortgage-backed securities, signaling a further shift in real-estate financing from banks to Wall Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash is flooding into the market, where mortgages for skyscrapers, strip malls and other commercial properties are bundled together and sold off as bonds to investors varying from pension funds and insurance companies to hedge funds and wealthy investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That strong demand, however, is driving down the yields investors receive. And some bankers fear the rush into the bonds may even loosen lending standards, allowing real-estate buyers to borrow more and thus drive up property prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, investors could be putting themselves at risk if their zealousness to lend by purchasing mortgage bonds causes property buyers to overreach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What is supporting real-estate prices?" asks Rob Brennan, who runs Credit Suisse First Boston's real-estate finance and securitization group. "It's the availability of competitively priced debt. That's thanks to the public CMBS market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate owners borrowed $72 billion through CMBS debt in the first half of 2005, compared with a record $94 billion for all of 2004, according to the Commercial Real Estate Securities Association. The CMBS market has grown tenfold during the past decade, with about $500 billion of securities outstanding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"CMBS is slowly eating away market share from traditional real-estate lenders like banks and life-insurance companies," said John Westerfield, a <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> managing director responsible for real-estate lending. That may be why traditional lenders <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Wachovia Corp</span>. now also happen to run the leading CMBS operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sam Zell, a well-known real-estate investor and chairman of <span class="companylink">Equity Office Properties Trust</span>, the biggest office-building owner in the country, believes that the CMBS market has removed some of the clubbiness in the industry, allowing people to raise funds even if they don't have relationships with bankers. "It's made the overall commercial real-estate market more viable to everybody," Mr. Zell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For CMBS investors, the insatiable thirst for yield in a low-yield world is driving much of the demand. While yields on CMBS bonds have fallen, they still offer higher payouts than most government and corporate bonds. But with so many players flooding the CMBS market, returns for investors also are less rewarding than in the past: According to <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span>, the yield on a single-A-rated CMBS dropped to 5.23% from 5.88% three years ago, while the yield premium the bonds pay above Treasury securities dropped to one percentage point from 1.35 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People are taking more risk for less reward," said Ken Cohen, a <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> managing director who puts together CMBS deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the yield advantage to other bonds is still attractive enough for many investors. <span class="companylink">Putnam Investments</span>, for example, now holds CMBS in more than 10% of its active accounts, compared with less than 1% two years ago. "As long as [yield] spreads stay where they are, we're going to be heavily involved," said Rob Bloemker, managing director and team leader of the mortgage-backed securities and government group for Putnam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which is why some in the industry fear that real-estate owners will keep borrowing more and more, a real problem should the property market pull back. But it isn't just property buyers who are piling in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The real pressure is coming from the developers," said Mark Finerman, who heads the real-estate finance group for RBS Greenwich Capital. Indeed, gung-ho developers can get a loan to break ground on a new building in Manhattan for as little as a 5% down payment on the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The CMBS market grew out of the <span class="companylink">Resolution Trust Corp</span>., which was created to sell off assets of failed savings and loans in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The RTC issued nearly $15 billion of commercial mortgages, which Wall Street firms soon found a way to turn into bonds, with each bond divvied up into individual "tranches" that allow buyers to pick their preferred level of risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But conventional developers were slow to adopt CMBS financing. They already had age-old relationships with traditional bankers and insurance companies.

That was then: Recently, Shorenstein used CMBS debt to buy office towers like 125 Park Ave. in New York City and 45 Fremont St. in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The CMBS market seized up along with other credit markets in the wake of the 1998 Russian debt crisis, and the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks also scared off some investors who didn't want to own bonds backed by loans on any one property market. But the market came back, helped by the fact that more loans now routinely back each bond. That makes the bonds less susceptible to the fortunes of a few buildings.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New orders for durable-goods rose strongly in the U.S. in June, suggesting that business investment, an important pillar of economic growth, could accelerate after a slowdown earlier this year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Commerce Department reported that new orders for manufactured durable goods -- products like cars, computers and industrial machinery -- increased $2.9 billion (2.4 billion euros), or 1.4%, to $215.4 billion in June. That followed a 6.4% May increase. Earlier gains had been driven by surging orders for airplanes and parts received by companies like Boeing Co. But the latest report showed solid underpinning to business investment outside of this sector. Excluding transportation equipment, new orders were up 2.6% in June after a 0.9% rise the month before.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists watch durable-goods orders closely because they are considered an indicator of future economic activity. The numbers are "really encouraging," said David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities. "It looks like the capital-goods sector is kicking into high gear again. This bodes well for second-half growth."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other reports on economic growth were encouraging. The Commerce Department reported that sales of new, single-family houses in June rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of nearly 1.4 million units, a record. The sales rate was up 4% from the month before, and 14% from a year earlier. Economists took it as yet another sign that the housing boom continued unabated, though the average and median prices of new homes fell for the month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has been clear for several weeks now that consumer spending and housing are on a firm footing as the economy moves into the second half. The outlook for business investment is less certain. Investment showed some signs of slowing a few months ago. In the first quarter, for instance, business investment grew at a 4.1% annual rate, according to Commerce Department figures, the slowest pace of growth since early 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say part of the slowdown was tied to the expiration of tax incentives last year, which encouraged businesses to make investments in 2004 while the incentives still applied. The latest durable-goods report indicates that businesses have shrugged off uncertainties and are poised to resume robust spending on equipment, economists say.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report was the latest in a series of recent indicators that suggest the industrial sector and business investment are gathering steam. Early in the month, the Institute for Supply Management said its monthly survey of supply managers rebounded in June, in part because of a surge in new orders. Moreover, regional Federal Reserve banks in Philadelphia and New York have reported increases in their measures of industrial activity.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though recent earnings reports have been mixed, several blue-chip companies have pointed to what seems to be an improving outlook for business investment. Last week, Ingersoll-Rand Co., the maker of industrial equipment, boosted its full-year earnings guidance, citing strong orders. Texas Instruments Inc. reported strong demand for semiconductor chips for cellphones. And General Electric Co. reported double-digit gains in orders for the second quarter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Highlighting the improving outlook, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said in testimony to Congress last week, "Business investment in equipment and software seems to be on a solid upward trajectory in response to supportive conditions in financial markets and the ongoing need to replace or upgrade aging high-tech and other equipment."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Excluding aircraft and defense, new orders for capital goods rose to nearly $69 billion in June, up 3.8% from the month before and 11.1% from a year earlier, the Commerce Department reported. Economists watch this indicator closely for signs of underlying business demand.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New orders for computers and electronic products, up four of the past five months, rose by $3 billion, or 8.6%, to $38.2 billion. The category was led by gains in communications equipment, which increased by $1.3 billion.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The numbers were somewhat stronger than expected [and] very broad-based," said Joel L. Naroff, president and chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors. "This seems to indicate a fair amount of [business] confidence out there." It also indicates that business investment is "likely to stay solid the rest of the year," he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, the strong capital-spending data validate the Fed's view that business investment remains healthy, which means more interest-rate increases are imminent, Mr. Naroff said.  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New orders for durable-goods rose strongly in the U.S. in June, suggesting that business investment, an important pillar of economic growth, could accelerate after a slowdown earlier this year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Commerce Department reported yesterday that new orders for manufactured durable goods -- products like cars, computers and industrial machinery -- increased $2.9 billion, or 1.4%, to $215.4 billion in June. That followed a 6.4% May increase. Earlier gains had been driven by surging orders for airplanes and parts received by companies like Boeing Inc. But the latest report showed solid underpinning to business investment outside of this sector. Excluding transportation equipment, new orders were up 2.6% in June after a 0.9% rise the month before.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists watch durable-goods orders closely because they are considered an indicator of future economic activity. The numbers are "really encouraging," said David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities. "It looks like the capital-goods sector is kicking into high gear again. This bodes well for second-half growth."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other reports on economic growth were encouraging. The Commerce Department reported that sales of new, single-family houses in June rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of nearly 1.4 million units, a record. The sales rate was up 4% from the month before, and 14% from a year earlier. Economists took it as yet another sign that the housing boom continued unabated, though the average and median prices of new homes fell for the month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has been clear for several weeks now that consumer spending and housing are on a firm footing as the economy moves into the second half. The outlook for business investment is less certain. Investment showed some signs of slowing a few months ago. In the first quarter, for instance, business investment grew at a 4.1% annual rate, according to Commerce Department figures, the slowest pace of growth since early 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say part of the slowdown was tied to the expiration of tax incentives last year, which encouraged businesses to make investments in 2004 while the incentives still applied. The latest durable-goods report indicates that businesses have shrugged off uncertainties and are poised to resume robust spending on equipment, economists say.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report was the latest in a series of recent indicators that suggest the industrial sector and business investment are gathering steam. Early in the month, the Institute for Supply Management said its monthly survey of supply managers rebounded in June, in part because of a surge in new orders. Moreover, regional Federal Reserve banks in Philadelphia and New York have reported increases in their measures of industrial activity.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though recent earnings reports have been mixed, several blue-chip companies have pointed to what seems to be an improving outlook for business investment. Last week, Ingersoll-Rand Co., the maker of industrial equipment, boosted its full-year earnings guidance, citing strong orders. Texas Instruments Inc. reported strong demand for semiconductor chips for cellphones. And General Electric Co. reported double-digit gains in orders for the second quarter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Highlighting the improving outlook, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said in testimony to Congress last week, "Business investment in equipment and software seems to be on a solid upward trajectory in response to supportive conditions in financial markets and the ongoing need to replace or upgrade aging high-tech and other equipment."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Excluding aircraft and defense, new orders for capital goods rose to nearly $69 billion in June, up 3.8% from the month before and 11.1% from a year earlier, the Commerce Department reported. Economists watch this indicator closely for signs of underlying business demand.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New orders for computers and electronic products, up four of the past five months, rose by $3 billion, or 8.6%, to $38.2 billion. The category was led by gains in communications equipment, which increased by $1.3 billion.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The numbers were somewhat stronger than expected [and] very broad-based," said Joel L. Naroff, president and chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors. "This seems to indicate a fair amount of [business] confidence out there." It also indicates that business investment is "likely to stay solid the rest of the year," he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, the strong capital-spending data validate the Fed's view that business investment remains healthy, which means more interest-rate increases are imminent, Mr. Naroff said.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By Kemba Dunham </div><div>747 words</div><div>26 July 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales rocketed to new highs last month, led by America's insatiable appetite for condominiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing, or previously owned, homes rose 2.7% in June from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 7.33 million units, the fastest pace on record. The previous record was 7.18 million, set in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales rose for all types of homes in all regions of the U.S., but the star performers were condos and cooperatives, where the sales pace has been running twice as fast as for single-family homes. The trade group's report said sales of condos rose 4.5% in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 960,000 units, the fourth consecutive month that sales of condos hit a record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of single-family homes rose 2.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.37 million, also a record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the second quarter, condo sales were up about 37% on an annualized basis, compared with 22% for single-family homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices for condos also are higher than and are rising faster than prices for single-family homes. Last year, the nationwide median price of a condo was $193,600, up 17% from the previous year, according to the group. The median price of a single-family home was $184,100, up 8.3% from the previous year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, the national median existing-home price for all housing types was $219,000, up 14.7% from a year earlier. The June rise was the strongest increase since November 1980, when year-over-year price appreciation was 15.6%. The median price of a condo was $223,500 last month, up 14.8% from a year earlier. Median means that half of the homes sold for more and half sold for less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Lereah, the Realtors association's chief economist, attributed the strength in condo sales to empty nesters who are downsizing from larger single-family homes and young professionals who might have rented in previous years but now are tending to buy instead of rent. The jump in condo sales and prices also reflects investor purchases, he said, as well as interest-only loans being used to finance many condos. "That worries me, because I'm not that comfortable with the stability of interest-only loans," he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condo sales are strong nationwide and have reached frenzied levels in Miami, Las Vegas and San Diego. There is some concern that these markets could peak soon, just as developers are adding lots of new supply to the market. In Chicago, for instance, some condo developers have reported slower-than-expected sales in recent months because buyers have so many choices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As inventories rise, economists expect home-price appreciation to begin to slow. Total housing inventory levels rose 3.8% at the end of June to 2.65 million existing homes, which represents a 4.3-month supply at the current sales pace. The supply of homes on the market has been inching up since January's record low of 3.8 months, but is still relatively low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We don't want to see this measure going up too much, but I would be more concerned if we start to see the month supply of new homes going up as opposed to existing homes," said J.P. Morgan Chase economist Haseeb Ahmed. "You can't just take new homes off the market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lereah of the Realtors group said he expects home sales to remain robust in the second half. "There's a lot of momentum right now, with all the major housing measures going strong," he said. "There will be signs of a slowdown only if mortgage rates go up."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing sector in June broke yet another record as sales of previously owned homes again exceeded expectations and climbed thanks to tumbling mortgage rates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home resales rose to a 7.33 million annual rate last month, up 2.7% from May's revised 7.14 million pace and breaking April's record rate of 7.18 million, the National Association of Realtors said yesterday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The level of resales in June beat Wall Street expectations. Analysts predicted a 7.14 million rate of sales of previously owned homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Obviously, the housing market's hot right now," NAR chief economist David Lereah said. "Mortgage rates have fallen three consecutive months. The economy has been improving. That combination has provided a great deal of support in terms of demand for home-buying."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average 30-year mortgage rate was 5.58% last month, down from 5.72% in May, according to Freddie Mac. The rate was 6.29% in June 2004.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories rose 3.8% at the end of June to 2.65 million existing homes available for sale, representing 4.3 months of supply at the current sales pace. "The irony is that housing inventory is tight enough to boost prices but not enough to curb overall sales," said Al Mansell, NAR president.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home price increased to $219,000, compared with a revised $206,000 in May, and was was nearly 15% higher than June 2004's $191,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales rose throughout the U.S. Demand advanced 3.4% in the Northeast, 1.9% in the Midwest, 1.1% in the South and 5.5% in the West.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR's Mr. Lereah observed that interest rates have edged a bit higher since the period reflected in the latest report. "We do expect a modest slowing in the numbers you are seeing today," he said. "I do worry going forward about the interest-only loans and option [adjustable-rate mortgages] now on the market."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lereah expects strong demand for homes to continue -- just not at the levels reflected by these numbers. "I see sales tempering but still [remaining] at very, very high levels," he said.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By Rafael Gerena-Morales </div><div>709 words</div><div>20 July 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. workers saw surprisingly large increases in pay at the end of 2004, according to a new report from the government that takes a comprehensive look at employment and wage trends across 317 of the country's largest counties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department report said weekly salaries rose an average of 5.7% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier. The gain seemed to be bolstered by commissions and end-of-year bonuses, which are included in the counts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report showed wages are growing, from suburban areas like Williamson County, near Austin, Texas, to big cities like New York. It also helped clarify a muddled national picture on the state of worker pay. Economists have been puzzled for months about why national income seems to be rising at a healthy pace while measures of hourly wages are barely keeping up with inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest report lends weight to the argument that end-of-year bonuses and commissions were a factor, economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The statistics showed that weekly wages averaged $812 throughout the nation. Workers in Williamson saw the biggest increases in weekly wages, with a 17.8% jump to $893 from a year earlier. Williamson County, the home of Dell Inc., is benefiting from the recovery in the tech sector and from robust single-family housing construction, according to Moody's Investors Service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The county of Rutherford, Tenn., near Nashville, saw employment increase 8.9%, the biggest percentage employment gain in the period. Maricopa County (which includes Phoenix) had the biggest actual gain in new jobs, 75,700 in December 2004 compared with a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dave Iaia, a regional economist with Global Insight, a Waltham, Mass., forecasting firm, says job creation tended to be fastest in warm-weather counties that attracted lots of new families, such as Florida, Arizona and Nevada. Population expansion in those areas is promoting job growth in service sectors such as education, health and tourism, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joseph Carson, an economist at Alliance Capital, said many of the counties with large wage gains also had strong housing markets. "There could have been a lot of commissions paid out on real-estate transactions and year-end bonuses tied to those sales."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The largest declines in employment occurred in Wayne, Mich., where employment was down 12,600, and Allegheny, Pa., where employment was down 3,900. No county experienced year-over-year declines in average weekly wages, although Kalamazoo, Mich., had the smallest increase in wages, at 0.5%, followed by the 0.7% rise in Richmond, N.Y.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Commerce Department said housing starts were unchanged at a seasonally adjusted 2.004 million annual rate last month. Permits for future building rose by 2.4% in June to a 2.111 million annual rate after falling a revised 4% in May. "We have to settle for housing demand that is torrid rather than scalding," RBS Greenwich Capital Markets economist Stephen Stanley said. "The bottom line is that the housing sector is still extremely strong."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Housing starts in the U.S. didn't budge during June as construction rebounded in the South while decreasing in the rest of the nation, but permits for future groundbreakings climbed as low mortgage rates enticed buyers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said yesterday that housing starts were unchanged at a seasonally adjusted 2.004 million annual rate last month. Permits for future building rose by 2.4% in June to a 2.111 million annual rate after falling a revised 4% in May.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have to settle for housing demand that is torrid rather than scalding," RBS Greenwich Capital Markets economist Stephen Stanley said in prepared analysis. "The bottom line is that the housing sector is still extremely strong."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low financing costs and concern that lending rates might escalate later this year are driving home-buying. According to Freddie Mac, the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage in June was 5.58%, the lowest monthly level since March 2004's 5.45%. Rates have stayed low despite a yearlong campaign by the Federal Reserve to increase short-term borrowing costs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest available government data show new-home sales rose 2.1% to a 1.271 million annual rate during May. The ratio of houses for sale to houses sold was 4.2. With supplies lean and demand hot, prices for houses in the U.S. have been rising, averaging $281,400 in May -- an increase from May 2004's $206,400.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With demand still high, home builders remain optimistic about the housing market. The National Association of Home Builders' index for sales of new, single-family homes fell to 70 in July from a revised 72 in June. When the index exceeds 50, the number of builders surveyed who expect good sales outnumber those who expect poor sales.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After dropping almost steadily for three years, an important measure of housing affordability in the U.S. has reversed course in a development that could help put the brakes on prices in some of America's hottest markets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the most powerful fuel helping to sustain the five-year housing boom has been the onslaught of creative mortgage products -- from interest-only loans to adjustable-rate mortgages carrying starter rates as low as 1% -- that have allowed buyers to keep initial payments down even as home prices soared. As a result, the average initial monthly mortgage payment in the U.S. has largely declined since 2002, according to Bear Stearns Cos.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in a significant shift, those numbers reversed direction in the first quarter. The average initial mortgage payment for home buyers in the U.S. climbed to $2,338 in the first quarter from $2,060 in the fourth quarter of 2004, according to the investment bank. Bear Stearns looked at jumbo mortgages, which are loans above $359,650.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That suggests many home buyers are likely to have an increasingly difficult time offsetting higher home prices by taking advantage of low interest rates and new mortgage products designed to lower monthly payments. If this trend continues, some home buyers may have to stretch more or set their sights lower. Declining affordability also could help slow the torrid home-price appreciation in the U.S.'s hottest home markets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline in affordability in some markets in the U.S. is supported by other recent data. In 41 out of 325 metro areas throughout the U.S., home prices were so high during the first quarter that someone earning the median income couldn't afford a median-priced home based on traditional lending standards, according to an analysis prepared for The Wall Street Journal by consulting firm Economy.com. In the fourth quarter, 29 metro areas were considered "unaffordable." Among the additions: Stockton, California, and Worcester, Massachusetts.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another telling note: In much of the U.S., rising incomes aren't keeping pace with the hefty increases in home prices. Home-price appreciation outpaced income growth in 38 of the 50 states and the District of Columbia in the 12 months through March, according to an analysis prepared by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Nationwide, home prices rose 6.7 percentage points faster than incomes during this period, according to the FDIC. "Income growth has not kept pace with home-price growth, and in recent years that gap has been widening," says Barbara Ryan, an associate director at the FDIC.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, housing prices could continue to climb, thanks in part to interest rates that are still at historically low levels. In addition, how much impact declining affordability will have depends in part on whether it is offset by shifting demographics and by rising employment -- which creates rising incomes -- says David Berson, chief economist of Fannie Mae. Another factor: what happens to demand from investors who tend to focus more on total return than on their monthly payments.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As affordability has declined, many borrowers have increased their buying power by shifting to adjustable-rate loans and interest-only mortgages, which allow borrowers to pay interest and no principal in the loan's early years. More recently, many have embraced option ARMs, which give borrowers multiple payment choices. Borrowers who elect to make the minimum payment can see their loan balance rise, which is known as "negative amortization."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We postponed the inevitable with these interest-onlies and negative-amortization" loans, says David Lereah, chief economist of the National Association of Realtors. "But you can't sustain double-digit price appreciation and keep homes affordable."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the steady upward appreciation in prices hasn't had much of an impact on home sales. The NAR boosted its forecast Wednesday of existing-home sales to show a rise of 2.8% to 6.97 million this year, setting another record.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In California, where affordability is a big problem, more-affordable areas are seeing bigger price gains. Home-price growth in San Diego and Orange County, two of California's least affordable markets, has dropped to the single digits, according to the California Association of Realtors, while prices have climbed more than 20% in less-expensive areas, such as Riverside-San Bernardino.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, just 16% of households in California can afford the median-priced home, according to the California Association of Realtors. That is the lowest level since 1989, when the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 10.33%. Rates on 30-year fixed-rate loans currently average just 5.81%, according to HSH Associates in Pompton Plains, New Jersey.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently, innovative mortgage products have made it easy for home buyers to buy ever more expensive homes while taking less out of their pockets. Monthly payments on jumbo loans have risen only once since 2002, according to Bear Stearns. That climb came when rates jumped in the third quarter of 2004 and quickly was reversed, thanks largely to the surging popularity of option ARMs. Option ARMs and interest-only loans have accounted for 65% to 70% of jumbo-mortgage originations in recent months, according to UBS AG.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new data suggest "the housing market could cool under its own weight," says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Economy.com.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The advantages of shifting from a fixed-rate mortgage to an ARM or other affordability product have been declining as the U.S. Federal Reserve has boosted short-term interest rates and the yield curve has flattened, narrowing the gap between short- and long-term interest rates. Rates on ARMs that are fixed for the first year currently average 4.7%, according to HSH Associates. That is the highest level since July 2002 and just 1.11 percentage points lower than the rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. As recently as May 2004, borrowers could cut the rate on their loan by 2.41 percentage points by opting for a one-year ARM instead of a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher short-term rates also are reducing the attractiveness of option ARMs. Once the initial teaser period -- which can be as brief as a month -- ends, rates on these loans can jump to 5.5% or more, not much lower than the rate on a traditional 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. Credit-rating services recently set tougher standards for option ARMs because of fears that borrowers who hold these loans will default at a higher rate. That, says Dale Westhoff, a senior managing director at Bear Stearns, "ultimately makes it more expensive to originate these kinds of loans."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A handful of lenders have tried coupling option ARMs with 40-year mortgages, but coming up with additional ways to reduce monthly payments is likely to be difficult. Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. says that some proposed mortgage programs it has been asked to evaluate recently are aimed at fixing the low payment for a longer period. Others try to manage the sharp increase in payments a borrower can face when the interest-only period ends or the option ARM resets so that the mortgage balance is paid off during the remaining term. With some lenders offering rock-bottom teaser rates, "I don't know how much lower you can get" when it comes to reducing the initial monthly payment, says S&amp;P Associate Director Brian Grow.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By Jessica E. Vascellaro </div><div>816 words</div><div>5 July 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American manufacturers are boosting spending on new plants at the fastest pace in several years, an indication that the sector is healthy enough to begin adding new capacity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the 12-month period that ended in May, spending on construction in the manufacturing sector rose $28.1 billion, or a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 24.3%. It was the largest increase for any category of construction, according to a Census Bureau report released Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While spending on manufacturing construction is still far below the $40 billion annual record set in the mid-1990s, the recent spurt has returned construction spending in manufacturing back above levels last seen in 2001. The Census Bureau report showed that construction spending over all categories, including manufacturing, declined in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.1 trillion, 0.9% below April. But economists discounted the monthly declines, which they said were distorted by quirks in the weather and seasonal factors. The year-over-year figures, they said, are more telling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The construction rebound "is a hopeful sign," says Donald A. Norman, an economist at the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, a public-policy group in Arlington, Va. "There is a lot of investment in companies abroad, but we are still alive and kicking" here in the U.S. David Huether, chief economist at the National Association of Manufacturers, says the spending on construction means "the recovery in manufacturing has gone on long enough for companies to start expanding capacity." He says the trend also means that manufacturers are "pretty confident that the economic recovery" is on track.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The list of companies that are building covers a wide range of industries. In Lima, Ohio, Procter &amp;Gamble Co., is undergoing a multimillion-dollar expansion of its laundry-detergent factory, adding new assembly lines and hundreds of new jobs. Intel Corp. has begun a $2 billion project to gut and rebuild one of its Phoenix, Ariz. plants to accommodate new chip-making technology. In Empire, Colo., Phelps Dodge Corp. is investing more than $20 million to increase the capacity of a molybdenum mine, a chemical used in the processing of steel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growth in spending on factory construction comes as manufacturing is picking up momentum. The Institute for Supply Management, which polls purchasing agents at more than 400 industrial companies, said on Friday that its index of manufacturing activity climbed to 53.8 in June from 51.4 in May. The latest reading was higher than economists had expected and represented a turn for the index, which had been declining in recent months. A reading in the index above 50 indicates that the manufacturing sector is expanding; a reading below 50 signals contraction. Economists attributed the increase in the index to the growth in new orders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists note that companies are deciding to break ground after solid growth in 2003 and 2004. Capital investment shot up during the same period. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the annual growth rate in nonresidential fixed investment in equipment and software flipped from a decline of 5.5% in 2002 to gains of 6.4% in 2003 and 13.6% in 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to an improving economic outlook, the pressure on companies to increase productivity also is driving construction. "Manufacturers have to invest to be competitive," says Aubert Martin, president and chief executive officer of Siemens AG's energy and automation division in Alpharetta, Ga., a leading supplier of power and electrical equipment. "Companies are willing to pay capital to update their industries."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Siemens has plenty of company among foreign firms that are expanding in the U.S. Britain's GKN PLC, a supplier of aerospace and automotive parts, acquired a St. Louis plant from Boeing Co. and 12,000 of GKN's 40,000 employees are based in the U.S. The company says it is continuing to look for investment opportunities in the U.S. "The USA is the world's largest market and we like to locate ourselves close to our customers," says company spokesman Peter Baillie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But such projects don't always mean additional employment in the manufacturing sector, which is only slowly regaining the millions of jobs lost during the recession. In May, employment in manufacturing was 14.3 million, down from a high of 17.6 million in April 1998. "The biggest issue we are facing is still the outsourcing of our work," says Bill Dugovish, a spokesman for the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also on Friday, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey was revised up to 96, several points higher than its May reading of 86.9. The increase was attributed to an improvement in consumers' confidence in their own financial situations and their hearing less bad news about the economy. </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. manufacturing sector appears to be gaining momentum, indicating demand for U.S. products is growing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management, which polls purchasing agents at more than 400 industrial companies, said Friday that its index of manufacturing activity climbed to 53.8 points in June from 51.4 in May.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The manufacturing sector has been expanding for slightly more than two years, but in recent months the growth was starting to slow, causing some concern. The increase in the June index marked the first rise in seven months. Many economists had expected the index to remain unchanged.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is a pretty positive sign that the manufacturing recovery that was softening in the first half is picking up," said David Heuther, chief economist at the National Association of Manufacturers. "I expect that we will see the index pick up strength in the months going forward."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Norbert Ore, chairman of the ISM's survey committee, said the increase reflects a spike in new orders. Eleven industries reported growth in new orders, including industrial and commercial equipment, computers, and wood and plastic products.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"New orders are the lifeblood of manufacturing and a leading indicator of production," Mr. Ore said. "When we see an increase in orders like we saw last month, it is expected to substantially drive the index."  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. manufacturing sector appears to be gaining momentum, a sign that demand for U.S. products is growing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management, which polls purchasing agents at more than 400 industrial companies, said on Friday that its index of manufacturing activity climbed to 53.8 in June from 51.4 in May.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The manufacturing sector has been expanding for just over two years, but in recent months the growth was starting to slow, causing some concern. The increase in the ISM for June marked the first index rise in seven months. Many economists had expected the index to remain unchanged.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is a pretty positive sign that the manufacturing recovery that was softening in the first half is picking up," says David Heuther, chief economist at the National Association of Manufacturers. "I expect that we will see the index pick up strength in the months going forward."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Norbert Ore, chairman of the ISM's survey committee, said the increase in the index reflects a spike in new orders. Eleven industries reported growth in new orders, including industrial and commercial equipment, computers, and wood and plastic products.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"New orders are the lifeblood of manufacturing and a leading indicator of production," says Mr. Ore. "When we see an increase in orders like we saw last month, it is expected to substantially drive the index."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While new orders were up overall, new export orders declined 4.5 percentage points, a sign that growth may be difficult to sustain in the face of lower demand abroad. Mr. Ore also cites the stronger dollar and high energy prices as likely barriers to future growth and predicts that June's results many not be duplicated soon.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the University of Michigan's consumer-sentiment survey, which was released on Friday, was revised up to 96, several points higher than its May reading of 86.9. The increase was attributed to an improvement in consumers' confidence about their own financial situations and perceptions that the economy is improving.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also on Friday, the U.S. Department of Commerce reported that total construction spending was down slightly in May, but remained strong when compared with a year ago. Total construction outlays fell 0.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.103 trillion. But that was up 7% when compared with a year earlier.

</div><div class="author">By Ruth Simon  </div><div>638 words</div><div>1 July 2005</div><div>The Asian Wall Street Journal</div><div>AWSJ</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2005 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors are buying homes at a record pace this year, adding fuel to an already heated U.S. housing market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the first four months of 2005, investors accounted for nearly one in 10 mortgages used to buy homes in the U.S., according to a new analysis by LoanPerformance, a unit of First American Corp. that tracks 46 million mortgages monthly and provides information to lenders and other industry participants. The investor share for the period, 9.86%, compares with 8.67% in 2004 and less than 6% in 2001.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The total number of mortgages used to buy investment properties might actually be higher, as these figures don't include mortgages used to buy second homes that might also provide rental income. LoanPerformance says the share of mortgages used to buy second homes has also hit record levels this year, climbing to 7.19% through the end of April from 6.05% in 2004 and just 2.18% in 2001.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising demand from investors has raised concerns that speculation may be playing an increasing role in driving home sales and home prices higher. In early June, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress that there were "signs of froth in some local markets where home prices seem to have risen to unsustainable levels" and that "speculative activity" may be a growing contributor. Existing-home sales hit their second-highest level on record in May, according to the National Association of Realtors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest numbers "are proof positive that speculation is infecting an increasing number of markets across the country," says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Economy.com, an economic-forecasting firm in West Chester, Pennsylvania. The investor share "is the most fragile source of demand" in the housing market, he adds. "It has juiced things up and can quickly evaporate once conditions or psychology shifts."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investor demand was strongest in Redding, California, accounting for 23.71% of mortgages used to buy homes, according to LoanPerformance. The investor share was also greater than 20% in four other U.S. metropolitan areas: Medford, Oregon; Pocatello, Idaho; Visalia, California; and Punta Gorda, Florida. Other markets with a high concentration of investors include Fresno and Bakersfield, both in California, and Tallahassee and Panama City, both in Florida.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other research suggests that investors and second-home buyers could be playing an even greater role. A study released by the National Association of Realtors in March found that 23% of homes purchased last year were for investment, while an additional 13% were vacation properties. Unlike the NAR data, the LoanPerformance figures include only properties financed with new mortgages. They don't include homes purchased with cash or financed by borrowers tapping equity in their primary residence.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The LoanPerformance data are "consistent with our survey," says NAR chief economist David Lereah. He says that many purchases are being made by baby boomers, or those born between 1946 and 1964, "in their peak earning years....who have created a lot of wealth in their primary residence and are using a great deal of that wealth to purchase a second home." Mr. Lereah adds that some housing markets have become "more vulnerable to price softening" because of a high level of speculative activity.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The demand from baby boomers is likely to remain strong, says John Tuccillo, a real-estate consultant and former NAR chief economist. But markets being driven by speculation are vulnerable to a correction, he adds.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What you will see down the line is that speculators will find that their expectations are not fulfilled and they will bail out with little or nothing to show for their efforts," says Mr. Tuccillo. "That will have a mini-fire-sale effect on the market."  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Soaring demand for civilian aircraft gave U.S. manufacturing a lift in May, a new report shows, but economists say the durable-goods data suggest the sector is soft as companies pare heavy inventories.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report from the U.S. Commerce Department said that new-home sales rose last month, as low borrowing costs continue to entice buyers. The department said single-family home sales were up 2.1% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,298,000, after slipping in April to 1,271,000 units. But the median home price fell 6.5% to $217,000 as activity shifted to the Midwest where prices are lower. Still, analysts characterize the housing market as "red hot," fanned by low mortgage rates and steady job growth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said orders for durable goods increased a seasonally adjusted 5.5% to $210.69 billion, the biggest jump since March 2004. April demand rose 1.4%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The headline number was carried aloft by this 165% increase in aircraft orders," said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics in Pepper Pike, Ohio. "But when you look beneath the surface, things are nowhere near as rosy." The orders placed in May, he said, "are great for the economy in 2008" because most are for future production.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airplane maker Boeing Co. had reported 200 new orders in May as a result of a surge in demand from Asian carriers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the aircraft boost, transportation orders advanced 21.2% in May, but excluding the volatile transportation sector, new orders for goods intended to last three or more years slid 0.2%. A key barometer of business spending -- orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft -- fell 2.3% last month, the sharpest decrease since a 4% drop in October 2004.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Bottom line, the data suggest the manufacturing sector is still on the soft side," A.G. Edwards economist Patrick Fearon said. "Higher energy prices might be discouraging some companies."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other data about U.S. manufacturing have suggested cooling in the sector's growth rate. Manufacturers' inventories of durable goods climbed 0.3% in May. Goldman Sachs wrote in a research note that Friday's durables report "suggests that U.S. manufacturers are not yet out of the woods when it comes to inventory correction."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management's latest index assessing U.S. manufacturing activity slowed to 51.4 in May, down from April's 53.3, but was above the reading of 50 that indicates the sector is growing. The ISM new-orders index reached 51.7 in May, lower than April's 53.7.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for new-home sales, Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York, predicted that sales will remain strong "until mortgage rates rise significantly. Overall, the housing market remains extremely strong and is set to stay that way for now."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joshua Shapiro, chief economist at MFR Inc. in New York, said the drop in the median home price reflected regional demand. "With the big shift in the month being weakness in the high-priced Northeast and strength in the low-priced Midwest, it is not surprising that the median sales price on a national basis eased to $217,000 from a previous $232,200," Mr. Shapiro said. "This is purely an issue of regional mix."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales climbed 22.9% in the Midwest to 268,000 but tumbled 24.5% in the Northeast to 74,000. Demand slipped 0.8% to 595,000 in the South and rose 1.7% to 361,000 in the West.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- New-home construction in the U.S. rose a modest 0.2% in May, the fifth increase in six months, as low mortgage rates remained the engine behind a robust housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts increased last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2,009,000 units, the Commerce Department said. But the rise was particularly modest after housing starts soared in April -- a 9.4% increase to an annual rate of 2,005,000 units, revised down from the 11% jump initially reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Labor Department said that new claims for unemployment benefits rose 1,000 last week to 333,000, a tiny increase after a steep decline of 19,999 in the previous week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists dismissed the idea that modest new construction last month and the revised housing number in April indicate a weakening market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The latest report was a positive one for the housing sector," said Michael Moran, an economist at Daiwa Securities Inc. "The soft aspects of the report were concentrated in the volatile multifamily sector, while single-family starts remained on solid ground."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seesaw category of multifamily starts fell about 19% in May to 233,000 units, compared with a nearly 34% jump in April. Single-family activity rose 4.7% in May to 1.704 million, after a 5% increase in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The backlog of unstarted homes -- permits issued for homes that haven't begun construction -- declined 4.6% in May, compared with a 6.3% increase in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, economists said a sturdy backlog suggests single-family starts will remain firm for several more months at least.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has said he wasn't concerned about the housing market crashing, despite what he referred to as some "froth" in some markets.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate on a 30-year mortgage, for instance, has remained below 6% for more than two months, sinking to 5.56% last week, according to Freddie Mac.</p>

</div><div class="author">By June Fletcher  </div><div>1636 words</div><div>15 June 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>A9</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A YEAR AND A HALF ago, David Krahn had never been to New Jersey's shore -- but he plunked down almost a million dollars to buy a house there anyway.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why? The Philadelphia utilities analyst had heard home prices along the shore were booming. So, for $990,000 (818,000 euros), he and a business partner bought a four-bedroom oceanfront townhouse in Brigantine, New Jersey, a barrier island about an hour away, to use as a summer getaway and part-time rental.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The townhouse appreciated so quickly -- local brokers say they can easily get $1.5 million for it today -- that Mr. Krahn is about to buy another, bigger place nearby. That house costs $1.875 million, but he hopes it, too, will be a gold mine. "Sure it's a risk," he says, "but where else can you make this sort of money so fast?"  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The phenomenal U.S. real-estate boom of the past five years is sweeping through the vacation-home market. Lured by relatively low interest rates and the promise of big resale value, investors and regular vacationers alike are snapping up second homes -- or, in some cases, third or fourth homes. And though a rise in interest rates could cool things off, the juggernaut shows few signs of stopping for now, even in upscale areas.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the trend toward shorter mini-vacations rather than two-week breaks among U.S. workers, the market is especially strong in slightly faded resort towns that are an easy drive from major cities, such as Sayville, New York, and Newport, Rhode Island. Indeed, the entire Jersey shore is popular with buyers, due to its proximity to New York, Philadelphia and Washington, as is the coast between Los Angeles and San Diego.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Places like Pompano Beach, Florida -- which have warehouse stores with minivans in the parking lot, rather than celebrities strolling past chic boutiques -- are coming into their own, too. "It's a come-and-get-it-while-you-can mentality," says local broker Karen Dove, noting inventory there is 30% lower than it was last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the National Association of Realtors, last year there were a record 2.82 million vacation-home purchases in the U.S., up 16% from the year before. All that demand has sent prices soaring. The price of vacation homes in the U.S. increased 21% during the past year, according to a survey done for The Wall Street Journal by Cambridge, Massachusetts, market-research firm Fiserv/CSW. That's about twice the rate of appreciation of U.S. homes overall. All but two of the towns in the survey, which looked at 54 ZIP Codes with median home prices above $350,000, saw double-digit gains; nearly all were waterfront.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not just the wealthy who are buying vacation homes, the Realtors association says. The typical buyer earns $71,000, and buys a home valued at slightly less than $200,000. But, increasingly, buyers who are just looking for a vacation property have to fight with investors for a place in paradise.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent report by the Realtors association found that more than one in 10 home purchases last year were by vacation-home buyers who planned to use the property themselves, a 20% rise over the previous year. But about a quarter of U.S. home sales were to investors, up 14% from the year before.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Mr. Krahn, many late-to-the-game vacation-home buyers are mixing business and pleasure, renting out their property part of the time.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, how long can the good times last? Watch the investors. They're often the first ones into an area, and will be the first to sell if they believe prices are starting to soften. Should investors start to pull out of today's hot markets, "it would be time to worry," says Gopal Ahluwalia, director of research for the National Association of Home Builders.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, vacation towns soon may find their price bubbles bursting. Economist David Stiff of Fiserv/CSW, who prepared our report, says many vacation-home markets are "more overvalued and at greater risk of a price correction" than primary-home markets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Below, a closer look at the hottest vacation-home market, based on appreciation during the past five years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oceanside, California  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five-Year Appreciation: 161.6%  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One-Year Appreciation: 28.3%  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median Home Price: $509,000  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with sparse cultural attractions -- the main draw is the California Surf Museum, where you can learn who invented the "hot curl board" and the "thruster" -- Oceanside has appreciated faster during the past five years than any other community on the list. Oceanside lost favor with vacation buyers after Camp Pendleton, the U.S. Marine Corps base, was built in 1942. But in the past few years, as prices in San Diego, 55 kilometers to the south, rocketed skyward, Oceanside's unglamorous military reputation didn't seem to matter much anymore. Rather, buyers fixated on the fact that Oceanside has some of the lowest beachfront prices in San Diego County, ranging from about $400,000 for a condo to $5 million for a single-family home. The median price won't get you anything on the ocean, but will buy a three-bedroom stucco fixer-upper built in the '80s, about eight kilometers from the water.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brigantine, New Jersey  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five-Year Appreciation: 149.9%  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One-Year Appreciation: 15.2%  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median Home Price: $358,500  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Located just north of Atlantic City but without the casinos or glitz, this 17-square-kilometer town -- which comprises an entire barrier island -- benefited from a tunnel built about two years ago connecting it directly to the Atlantic City Expressway. Now beachgoers from Philadelphia, 107 kilometers away, can drive there in a little more than an hour without encountering a single stoplight; it's an easy ride from New York and Washington, too. The island was once a refuge for pirates like Blackbeard and Captain Kidd and a launching spot for whalers, but now has a considerably gentler reputation. While it's still possible to snare a one-bedroom "condotel" in an old converted hotel for about $200,000, newer oceanfront homes sell for more than $4 million. The median price will buy a three-bedroom ranch house on the town's only golf course, but without a water view.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newport, Rhode Island  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five-Year Appreciation: 141.9%  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One-Year Appreciation: 17.7%  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median Home Price: $372,000  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the town's history museum this month, you can see an exhibit on 18th-century shoes, a reminder of the time when Newport was one of the leading ports in America. But the town's economy was wrecked during the American Revolution, when British forces occupied it, and it never quite recovered as an industrial power. So throughout the 19th century, the town transformed itself into a summer resort for the wealthy, like the Vanderbilts and Astors, creating the swanky image that most Americans have of the place today. But Newport is actually diverse, both ethnically and economically. Far more of the town's 26,000 residents are in the middle class than the yachting set. The second-home buyers who have flocked to Newport over the past few years tend to be middle class, too, paying around $300,000 to live in a condo chopped out of one of the city's many huge Victorian homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pompano Beach, Florida  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five-Year Appreciation: 134.9%  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One-Year Appreciation: 27.1%  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median Home Price: $355,000  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with most of the vacation towns on our list, Pompano Beach is young -- the first two non-Native American residents didn't arrive until 1896, and then promptly named the place after the first fish they had for dinner. The town grew quickly, and now has a population of 88,000. But it never managed to achieve the glamour of Palm Beach, 60 kilometers to the north, or the hipness of Fort Lauderdale, 18 kilometers to the south. The shopping areas grew bedraggled, and the '70s split-levels and older cottages weren't updated. "It wasn't held in high regard," says Ms. Dove, the local real-estate agent. It did, however, have beautiful beaches and lots of deep-water dockage along canals for boaters, at prices much lower than its tonier neighbors. Over the past five years, brokers say, the town has been transformed. Shopping areas and homes have been bulldozed to make way for waterfront townhouses and condos costing upward of $500,000; about two-thirds sell within a month. And the median price? These days, it won't get you much more than a two-bedroom condo on the Intracoastal Waterway.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sayville, New York  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five-Year Appreciation: 117.7%  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One-Year Appreciation: 10.8%  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median Home Price: $435,000  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Victorian time capsule about 80 kilometers from New York City, Sayville had a reputation in the mid-19th century as a summer destination for city dwellers, and even boasted an opera house at one point (it burned down in 1961). But the town lost out in the last half of the 20th century, when more families got cars and started driving to the Hamptons on New York's Long Island. In the past five years, however, jammed roads and sky-high prices in the Hamptons have caused second-home buyers to take a closer look at Sayville. Homes are snapped up so quickly, local real-estate agents say, that inventory is about 20% below last year's levels, even though the median price buys only a nine-room cottage.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, how long can the good times last? Watch the investors. They're often the first ones into an area, and will be the first to sell if they believe prices are starting to soften. Should investors start to pull out of today's hot markets, "it would be time to worry," says Gopal Ahluwalia, director of research for the National Association of Home Builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, vacation towns soon may find their price bubbles bursting. Economist David Stiff of Fiserv/CSW, who prepared our report, says many vacation-home markets are "more overvalued and at greater risk of a price correction" than primary-home markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because vacation homes are a discretionary purchase, when mortgage rates rise, demand will fall faster in vacation-home areas. Mr. Stiff expects prices to rise at half their current rate over the coming year. He expects the weakest performance in places that had the steepest price gains last year, particularly in Florida, Arizona and Southern California. New England and the Jersey shore, which have been cooling a bit for the past year or two, will have softer landings, he predicts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Below, a closer look at the hottest vacation-home market, based on appreciation over the past five years, in each of five states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oceanside, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[ZIP Code: 92054]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five-Year Price Appreciation: 161.6%</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One-Year Price Appreciation: 28.3%</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median Home Price: $509,000</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with sparse cultural attractions -- the main draw is the California Surf Museum, where you can learn who invented the "hot curl board" and the "thruster" -- Oceanside has appreciated faster over the past five years than any other community on our list.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once a summer movie colony for stars like Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks, Oceanside lost favor with vacation buyers after Camp Pendleton, the U.S. Marine Corps base, was built in 1942.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the past few years, as prices in San Diego, 35 miles to the south, rocketed skyward, Oceanside's unglamorous military reputation didn't seem to matter much anymore. Rather, buyers fixated on the fact that Oceanside has some of the lowest beachfront prices in San Diego County, ranging from about $400,000 for a condo to $5 million for a single-family home. The median price won't get you anything on the ocean, but will buy a three-bedroom stucco fixer-upper built in the '80s, about five miles from the water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New jobs in biotechnology have helped boost the year-round population to 173,300, but brokers say demand by second-home buyers is the main reason prices are rising so fast. Oceanside broker Marie Jebavy says vacationers are constantly offering her $850,000 or more for her three-bedroom ranch house with an ocean view, almost three times what she paid for it eight years ago. She turns them all down. "If I sold it, I couldn't afford anything near as nice close to the beach," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brigantine, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[08203]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five-Year Price Appreciation: 149.9%</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One-Year Price Appreciation: 15.2%</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median Home Price: $358,500</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Located just north of Atlantic City but without the casinos or glitz, this 6.4-square-mile town -- which comprises an entire barrier island -- benefited from a tunnel built about two years ago connecting it directly to the Atlantic City Expressway. Now beachgoers from Philadelphia, 67 miles away, can drive there in a little more than an hour without encountering a single stoplight; it's an easy ride from New York and Washington, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The island was once a refuge for pirates like Blackbeard and Captain Kidd and a launching spot for whalers, but now has a considerably gentler reputation. The big tourist attraction, ironically, is a Marine Mammal Stranding Center that cares for sick whales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it's still possible to snare a one-bedroom "condotel" in an old converted hotel for about $200,000, newer oceanfront homes sell for more than $4 million. The median price will buy a three-bedroom ranch house on the town's only golf course, but without a water view. Two miles of the island's oceanfront remain undeveloped, part of the state's Green Acres program to preserve open space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Brigantine's population doubles during the summer months, many of the 15,000 residents stay year-round because the town has one of the lowest property-tax rates in southern New Jersey. And the town's slim infrastructure bills mean most of those taxes go directly into the school system, helping to make it a top-rated district. "I guess you could call us the anti-Atlantic City," says local real-estate agent Jean Warkala.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newport, R.I.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[02840]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five-Year Price Appreciation: 141.9%</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One-Year Price Appreciation: 17.7%</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median Home Price: $372,000</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the town's history museum this month, you can see an exhibit on 18th-century shoes, a reminder of the time when Newport was one of the leading ports in America. But the town's economy was wrecked during the American Revolution, when British forces occupied it, and it never quite recovered as an industrial power. So throughout the 19th century, the town transformed itself into a summer resort for the wealthy, like the Vanderbilts and Astors, creating the swanky image that most Americans have of the place today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Newport is actually diverse, both ethnically and economically. Far more of the town's 26,000 residents are in the middle class than the yachting set. The second-home buyers who have flocked to Newport over the past few years tend to be middle class, too, paying around $300,000 to live in a condo chopped out of one of the city's many huge Victorian homes. (The swells can still buy an intact one, but they'll have to pony up a lot more -- an 1891 home with eight bedrooms and 91/2 baths is currently on the market for $14 million.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Liz Taber, a local real-estate agent, says many of the city's second-home buyers are Bostonians and New Yorkers who have been priced out of Nantucket, Martha's Vineyard and Cape Cod. "They buy here when they realize that everything is half the price of what you pay in the city -- even the cocktails," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pompano Beach, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[33062]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five-Year Appreciation: 134.9%</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One-Year Appreciation: 27.1%</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median Home Price: $355,000</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with most of the vacation towns on our list, Pompano Beach is young -- the first two non-Native American residents didn't arrive until 1896, and then promptly named the place after the first fish they had for dinner. As the southernmost settlement in newly fashionable Palm Beach County, the town grew quickly, and now has a population of 88,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it never managed to achieve the glamour of Palm Beach, 38 miles to the north, or the hipness of Fort Lauderdale, 11 miles to the south. The shopping areas grew bedraggled, and the '70s split-levels and older cottages weren't updated. "It wasn't held in high regard," says Ms. Dove, the local real-estate agent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It did, however, have beautiful beaches and lots of deep-water dockage along canals for boaters, at prices much lower than its tonier neighbors. Over the past five years, brokers say, the town has been transformed. Shopping areas and homes have been bulldozed to make way for waterfront townhouses and condos costing upward of $500,000; about two-thirds sell within a month. And the median price? These days, it won't get you much more than a two-bedroom condo on the Intracoastal Waterway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sayville, N.Y.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[11782]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five-Year Appreciation: 117.7%</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One-Year Appreciation: 10.8%</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median Home Price: $435,000</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Victorian time capsule about 50 miles from New York City, Sayville had a reputation in the mid-19th century as a summer destination for city dwellers, and even boasted an opera house at one point (it burned down in 1961). But the town lost out in the last half of the 20th century, when more families got cars and started driving to the Hamptons. Sayville became just a place where you bought oysters and caught the ferry to Fire Island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past five years, however, jammed roads and sky-high prices in the Hamptons have caused second-home buyers to take a closer look at Sayville. Homes are snapped up so quickly, local real-estate agents say, that inventory is about 20% below last year's levels, even though the median price buys only a nine-room cottage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The town of about 17,000 has a quirky sense of showmanship. Capping the social season is the annual "boat burn," when officials at the local maritime museum recreate a Viking burial by finding an old boat and setting it ablaze. Last year, some 3,000 visitors came to watch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sayville's newfound popularity has been good news for Shannon and Leslie Davis. Just two days after they put their four-bedroom Victorian farmhouse, about a half-mile from the Great South Bay of Long Island, on the market, a vacation-home buyer purchased it for $899,000, more than twice what they paid for it nine years ago. Now the couple has found a new home closer to the water, which they expect will appreciate even faster. Says Ms. Davis, a homemaker, "It's hard to find a town this quaint."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Dunk . . . After Two Years</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BASKETBALL STAR Karl Malone has sold his Salt Lake City house -- for $2.75 million, well below its original $6.1 million asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The eight bedroom, log-and-stone house had been on the market for two years and sold at auction. The buyer was Dwight Manley, Mr. Malone's agent. Mr. Manley says he's buying the house as an investment property and plans to resell it. With the real-estate market's strength, "I thought it was an exceptional value," says Mr. Manley, who wouldn't say how much the home would be listed for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 41-year-old Mr. Malone, who retired from the game in February, has also listed his house in Newport Beach, Calif., for $6.8 million. That ocean-view house has five bedrooms and four baths in 6,800 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The athlete is building a new house in Rustan, La., close to where he grew up. He plans to make that property his main residence, according to Thayne Fisher, vice president of Malone Properties. The company, owned by Mr. Malone, manages his real-estate assets, which also include timber properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Malone, a two-time NBA Most Valuable Player, built the Salt Lake City house in 1997 when he was on the Utah Jazz. It has 11 baths and measures 17,230 square feet. The property also has three guest suites, basketball and tennis courts and two swimming pools. Mr. Malone listed the house shortly after joining the Los Angeles Lakers in 2003. After it didn't sell for a year, he reduced its asking price to $5.75 million, and put it up for auction earlier this year. J.P. King Auction Co. handled the sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers say the home's original asking price was high for Salt Lake City. The median price of a single-family home there is $204,311, according to the Utah Association of Realtors. Brokers say high-end buyers usually prefer to buy properties in upscale nearby communities such as Park City. The median price for houses in Park City is $711,000. Sales of existing homes in the Park City area rose 53.5% in the first quarter of this year, compared with 17.6% in Salt Lake City, according to the Realtor group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Malone bought his Newport Beach house soon after joining the Lakers in the summer of 2003, says the listing agent, Roseanne Levan, of Coldwell Banker Previews International in Newport Beach. The house includes a media room and a master suite with terrace. The median single-family home price in Newport Beach is among the highest in the country at $1,297,500, according to DataQuick, a real-estate research firm in La Jolla, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Simplifying by Selling</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALIFORNIA INVESTOR and former Shaklee Corp. chief executive Gary Shansby has put on the market his 360-acre Sonoma, Calif., estate for $35 million. It's one of the most expensive San Francisco Bay-area listings on the market. Mr. Shansby, 67 years old, said he and his wife want to "simplify our lives now" as he recovers from a bout of prostate cancer. The couple plans to buy a smaller home in Mexico when the house sells.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shansby paid just over $5 million for the land in 1988. An 11,600-square-foot, Tuscan-style main house was built five years later on the property, in the heart of Sonoma Valley wine country. The house has two bedrooms and three baths, and the property includes a pool, spa and 10-acre vineyard with Syrah grapes. About 20 miles north of the Golden Gate Bridge, the site also includes a two-bedroom guest house and horse stables.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From Shaklee to TSG</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 1970s, Mr. Shansby took over as chairman and chief executive of Shaklee, a Pleasanton, Calif., maker of personal-care products. After leaving Shaklee, he co-founded a private-equity investment concern, Shansby Group, in 1987. (The company is now called TSG Consumer Partners LLC.) Last summer, the executive was diagnosed with cancer. Now cancer-free, Mr. Shansby sits on the board of the Prostate Cancer Foundation, founded by Michael Milken.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bay Area real estate has soared since the dot-com bust. The median price for a single-family home in the nine-county region is $622,000 -- more than three times the national average, according to DataQuick. Betty Brachman of Sotheby's International Realty has the listing. </p>

</div><div class="author">By Kemba J. Dunham </div><div>651 words</div><div>9 June 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing industry economists raised their forecast for home sales this year, noting that demand remains strong due to lower-than-expected mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists at the National Association of Realtors, a trade group, said they expect home sales to total a record 8.13 million units in 2005, up 1.8% from last year. Of that total, sales of previously owned homes are expected to reach 6.89 million units, up 1.6% from 2004. Sales of newly built homes are expected to total 1.24 million this year, up 3.2% from 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the NAR released a previous housing industry forecast in February, the group said it expected existing-home sales to decline 2% and new-home sales to decline 6.2%, in both cases due to rising interest rates. Instead, long-term interest rates have fallen this year. Last week, Freddie Mac said that rates on conventional 30-year fixed-rate mortgages were 5.6%, down from about 6.4% a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We expected that mortgage rates would go up much higher, but it looks like they will be in a very favorable range," which will keep demand strong, says Lawrence Yun, a senior economist at the NAR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trade group also estimates that home builders will have started construction on 2.02 million home units this year, up 3.4% from 2004 and the highest level of new-home starts since 1973.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although some economists worry that home builders may be creating too much supply, Mr. Yun doesn't believe that is the case. "Home-price appreciation over the last three years has been nearly 10% nationwide in each of the years, and that implies that there is a housing shortage," he says. "To alleviate the shortage, we will need close to two million housing starts, and we suggest that will be the case this year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR also estimates that home prices will continue to climb. The national median existing-home price for all housing types is expected to rise 8.8% in 2005 to $201,500, while the typical new-home price will increase 5.7% to $233,600, the group says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are glaring affordability problems developing in many of the hot markets, but the fact that prices are as high as they are means that the transactions are occurring," says David Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders. "The market is due for some cooling off, but how that evolves depends on the long-term interest rates."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even markets that have been left behind in the housing boom, such as those in the Midwest, may see some increases this year, according to the NAR. Cities like Detroit and Columbus, Ohio, saw little appreciation in home prices last year. But economists expect home sales to improve in those areas as the Midwest becomes more affordable compared with the rest of the country and lures more buyers. They also see the job market there strengthening, which could further strengthen the housing market there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Seiders says that "two wild cards" in the overall U.S. market are "overly aggressive" lenders offering such deals as interest-only loans, and speculative investors. But he doesn't see them being facilitators of a market crash. As long as the economic expansion continues at a steady pace with strong job growth, says Mr. Seiders, "I think the best bet is a slowdown on the price appreciation and a rebalancing of the housing market without a lot of damage."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR estimates that the U.S. gross domestic product is expected to grow 3.5% in 2005, with the unemployment rate holding around 5.2% for the rest of the year. It also predicts modest inflation. </p>

</div><div class="author">By Michael Schroeder </div><div>582 words</div><div>2 June 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- With low mortgage rates fueling a long housing boom, home prices continued to rise briskly during the first three months of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices rose 2.2% nationwide in the first quarter, a rate unchanged from last year's fourth quarter, according a quarterly index reported by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight. Prices rose 12.5% in the 12 months through March, compared with 11.9% for the comparable period the year before, Ofheo said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While housing prices continued their swift climb, U.S. manufacturing growth moderated in May. The Institute for Supply Management, which polls purchasing managers at more than 400 industrial companies, reported that its index of manufacturing activity stood at 51.4 in May, down from 53.3 in April and 55.2 in March -- the sixth consecutive monthly decline. Still, the reading is above 50, which indicates growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices are ballooning in some states. Nevada had the highest price appreciation of 31.2% in the 12-month period, followed by California and Hawaii, with 25.4% and 24.4%, respectively. Texas and Indiana showed the slowest price increases of 3.8% and 4.1%, respectively, Ofheo reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The House Price Index shows the rise in house prices continues at an extremely strong pace and raises the potential for declines in some areas later on," said Ofheo Chief Economist Patrick Lawler.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The quarterly house-price index, which uses data supplied by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, measures price movements on sales or refinancings of single-family homes whose mortgages are owned or guaranteed by the government-sponsored enterprises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the National Association of Realtors reported that sales of existing homes set a record in April. The Pending Home Sales Index, which tracks sales contracts that have been signed but not closed, was 128.2, up 3.6% from March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low interest rates continue to fuel the boom. Fixed 30-year mortgage rates averaged 5.61% last week, excluding fees, down from 6.24% a year ago, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home sales were expected to be tapering this year, but the index tells us that historic home sales are likely to continue," David Lereah, the group's chief economist, said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management, in its report, found both the biggest change in inflation pressures since the summer of 1975, along with a drop in hiring for the first time in 18 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising oil prices are significantly hampering the growth of U.S. industrial manufacturers, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers's most recent Manufacturing Barometer survey. Nearly half of the executives surveyed -- 47% -- cited rising energy prices as a potential barrier to growth during the next 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While this represents the longest period of [manufacturing] growth in the last 16 years, the data also indicate that the sector is losing momentum," said Norbert Ore, who directs the ISM survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said total construction spending grew 0.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.066 trillion in April, as office construction surged and activity in the housing market hit a record. Construction spending rose 0.6% in March.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- Fixed-rate home-mortgage rates declined in the week to yesterday, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>'s primary mortgage-market survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey said 30-year fixed mortgage rates averaged 5.65% this week, with an average fees and points of 0.6 point, compared with last week's 5.71%. A year ago, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage stood at 6.32%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 15-year fixed-mortgage rate averaged 5.21%, down from last week's 5.27% and 5.69% a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In adjustable-mortgage rates, the five-year Treasury-indexed hybrid ARM was unchanged at 5.07%. The one-year ARM rate stood at 4.21% this week, down from 4.26% last week. A year ago, this rate stood at 3.87%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> chief economist Frank Nothaft noted that with inflation remaining low, mortgage rates continued to decline, supporting new home sales and fueling the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Since the end of March long-term bond yields have fallen by more than a half of a percentage point, allowing interest rates on fixed-rate mortgages to decline as well. Consequently, both new and existing home sales in April reached record highs," Mr. Nothaft said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans snapped up new homes at an increasing pace in April, another sign the housing boom continues despite longstanding warnings the sector would cool off this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said sales of new single-family homes rose 0.2% in April from the month earlier to a record annual rate of 1.32 million units, though they were revised lower for the month of March. For April, they were up 13.3% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a new home rose 3.8% to $230,800 from a year earlier. Median means half the homes sold for more than that, half for less. The price increases on new homes weren't as eye-popping as gains reported Tuesday by the National Association of Realtors on prices for existing homes. The Realtors' report showed median prices of existing homes were 15.1% higher than a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason for the difference, the supply of new homes for sale is growing more rapidly than the supply of existing homes being put on the market. In April, 2.48 million existing homes were on the market, up 3.1% from a year earlier. By contrast, the supply of new homes on the market rose 15.2% in April from a year earlier to 440,000 on a seasonally adjusted basis, according to the Commerce Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We don't have, as we did a year or two ago, a situation where everything was undersupplied," said Michael Carliner, an economist with the National Association of Home Builders. "There are some places where supply has pretty much caught up with demand."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if home-price appreciation is slowing down for new homes, Robert Toll, chief executive of luxury-home builder Toll Brothers Inc., says he isn't seeing it. His company is now selling golf-course homes in Palm Beach for $1.4 million, up from $902,000 a year ago. The company's "mesquite" homes in Phoenix fetch $947,000, compared with $691,000 a year ago. "Every home that is being built is already sold," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another report showed the U.S. industrial sector in April regained some of its lost momentum. The Commerce Department said U.S. manufacturers received $200.3 billion of orders for durable goods in April, on a seasonally adjusted basis. That was up 1.9% from the month earlier and it was the first monthly increase since December. Orders are considered a leading indicator of manufacturing activity. But the sector is experiencing an uneven recovery. Orders for motor vehicles and defense equipment are down from a year ago. Orders for machinery and capital goods outside the defense sector still are posting double-digit increases when compared with a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"High gasoline prices have put the auto industry on the ropes . . . and the surge in imports is hurting consumer industries like appliances and lighting," said Daniel J. Meckstroth, chief economist for the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI. "However, the fact that nondefense capital-goods orders rose 3.8% in April and are up 9.8% in the last three months versus one year ago indicates that the core of industrial demand remains robust." </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. industrial sector has lost some momentum this year, but perhaps not as much as it seemed to be losing a few weeks ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said U.S. manufacturers received $200.3 billion in orders for durable goods in April. That was up 1.9% from the prior month, the first monthly increase since December, and an antidote to other recent surveys of manufacturers showing continued softening in the sector. In the first four months of the year, orders for products like computers, cars and tanks were up a moderate 4.3% from a year ago -- a slowdown from double-digit rises last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The rate of growth is slowing, there is no question," said Daniel J. Meckstroth, chief economist for the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the Commerce Department said sales of new single-family homes in the U.S. rose 0.2% in April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.32 million units, from the previous month. Sales, which were revised lower for the month of March, were up 13.3% from a year earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report was more evidence the housing-market boom continues, though it wasn't marked by the kind of eye-popping gains reported earlier in the week by the National Association of Realtors. The Realtors report showed median prices of existing homes were 15.1% higher than a year earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason for the difference: The supply of new homes for sale is growing much more rapidly than the supply of existing homes that are being put on the market. In April, 2.48 million existing homes were on the market for sale, up 3.1% from a year earlier. By contrast, 440,000 new homes were on the market for sale in April, seasonally adjusted, up 15.2% from a year earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We don't have, as we did a year or two ago, a situation where everything was undersupplied," said Michael Carliner, an economist with the National Association of Home Builders.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the manufacturing sector is experiencing a very uneven recovery. Orders for motor vehicles and defense equipment fell from a year ago, and telecommunications-equipment orders dropped sharply in April. But orders for machinery and capital goods outside of the defense sector are still posting double-digit percentage jumps from last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"High gasoline prices have put the auto industry on the ropes, defense spending for heavy military equipment is declining early this year, and the surge in imports is hurting consumer industries like appliances and lighting," said Mr. Meckstroth. "However, the fact that nondefense capital goods orders rose 3.8% in April and are up 9.8% in the last three months versus one year ago indicates that the core of industrial demand remains robust."  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing U.S. homes advanced in April at a record pace, driving home prices even higher as cheaper financing refueled the housing boom.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes rose 4.5% from the month before to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 7.18 million units, the fastest pace on record. At the same time, the national median home price was up 15.1% from a year ago to $206,000 (164,000 euros). That marked the biggest increase since November 1980, when prices rose 15.6%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Lereah, the NAR's chief economist, said in a news release, "a new record is a bit unexpected, but so is the performance of mortgage interest rates, which have been lower than forecast. When we look at recent job gains, we see all the positive factors coming together to coincide with a powerful demographic demand for housing."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the Federal Reserve's campaign to push up short-term interest rates, longer-term interest rates have been falling. The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage fell to 5.86% last month from 5.93% in March, according to Freddie Mac.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is no evidence that monetary policy has had a dampening influence on the housing market and we view the strong gain in home prices as further evidence of easy money," economists at Bear Stearns wrote in a research note.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a luncheon speech to the Economic Club of New York last Friday, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan acknowledged the housing market may be getting overheated. "There are a number of things, which I think suggest at a minimum, there is a little froth in this market," he said. Though he stopped short of suggesting there was a national real-estate bubble, he said "it's hard not to see that there are a lot of local bubbles."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response, federal banking regulators are planning to issue new guidelines for mortgage lenders early next year. Regulators have cited the recent proliferation of adjustable-rate mortgages and interest-only mortgages, particularly in high-cost markets, as cause for worry.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales are considered a lagging indicator in terms of consumers' response to mortgage rates, since they are booked at closing instead of at contract. But other housing indicators have also displayed continued strength. Housing starts, for instance, jumped 11% in April.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR's report showed that the inventory of homes on the market rose to 4.2 months in April, compared with March's unrevised 4.0 months. Existing-home sales among four regions in the U.S. were mixed: Demand was up 4.3% in the Northeast, up 5.8% in the Midwest, up 7.4% in the South and flat in the West.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By Jon E. Hilsenrath </div><div>558 words</div><div>25 May 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing U.S. homes advanced at a record pace in April, driving home prices even higher as cheaper financing refueled the housing boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes rose 4.5% from the month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 7.18 million units, the fastest pace on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the national median home price was up 15.1% from a year earlier to $206,000. Median means that half of the homes sold for more and half sold for less. It was the biggest increase since November 1980. Back then, home prices were being driven by broad, economywide inflation. Today, by contrast, economywide inflation is relatively dormant, meaning home-price gains in real terms are soaring at an especially astonishing pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When I see increases like this, it does indicate to me that there could be some frenzied buying out there," said David Lereah, chief economist with the Realtors association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest report is likely to get the attention of officials at the Federal Reserve, who are becoming increasingly concerned about froth in the market. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan called attention to it last week in comments to the Economic Club of New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Fed officials met earlier this month, they expected home-price appreciation to moderate in the months ahead, according to minutes of their May 3 monetary policy meeting released yesterday. The latest housing report shows no sign of that happening, and indicates price gains may even be accelerating nationally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed has raised the short-term federal-funds rate eight times in the past year to 3%. However long-term interest rates haven't moved in sync with the Fed's campaign. The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage fell to 5.86% last month, from 5.93% in March, according to Freddie Mac. That has added fuel to the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developments in the West were emblematic of the momentum behind prices. Sales of homes in the West were flat in April compared with March, at an annual rate of 1.61 million units. The volume of sales was up a modest 2.5% from a year earlier. But median home prices in the West were 21% higher than a year earlier, despite the sales slowdown. Mr. Lereah said this is largely because of tight supplies in the region.In April the supply of existing homes for sale nationwide grew 5% to 2.48 million units. But the added supply wasn't enough to put a cap on price gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists regard the existing-home-sales report as a lagging economic indicator, because it is based on contract closings rather than signings. The Realtor association's pending home-sales index, which is based on contract signings, fell 0.3% in March, a sign that some of the April increase might be overstated. But industry officials remain ebullient.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"May is going to be another good month," said Tom Kunz, chief executive of Century 21 Real Estate Corp.</p>

</div><div class="author">By James B. Stewart SmartMoney </div><div>903 words</div><div>25 May 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHEN FEDERAL RESERVE Chairman Alan Greenspan used the word "froth" in connection with the current real-estate market last week, he was rather late to the party. Economists, pundits and journalists have been saying for months that the real-estate market is overheated. About the only people who aren't fretting about soaring real-estate prices are the ever-upbeat real-estate brokers (and even they will say, off the record, that the market is crazy) and, of course, investors making their deposits on unbuilt Florida condos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Can all these Cassandras actually be right? After all, markets usually factor in the conventional wisdom, and prices are set accordingly. If everyone believes that real-estate prices are about to implode, they already would have imploded. Despite the current chorus of caution, buyers still are lining up to buy real estate. Just yesterday, we learned that existing home sales jumped 4.5% in April to a record 7.18 million units, according to the National Association of Realtors -- far stronger than the flat reading economists were expecting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm not convinced that real estate is in a bubble, or that prices necessarily are headed for an imminent collapse. I'm not selling my apartment or my weekend house in upstate New York to try to capitalize on a market peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, I wouldn't dream of putting more money into real estate right now, and I wouldn't want to be overleveraged with big mortgages in order to cash in on rising home prices. I can't foresee the future, but I can say to a near certainty that real-estate prices won't keep soaring at an annualized rate in excess of 20%, as they did last year in some areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But all of this prompts an important question for first-time home buyers, people who just want a decent place to live and some security for their families. What's someone to do who's stuck paying rent and watching his or her savings steadily fall behind rising home prices?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I know the feeling. I remember vividly trying to save the money for a down payment on a New York apartment during the early and mid-1980s, another period of fast-rising real-estate prices. The more I saved, the more I fell behind. Finally, after 10 years of renting, I landed a book advance that, along with all my savings, became the down payment on a modest apartment. I was convinced I was buying at the top.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York real-estate prices did plunge, but not until 1991, and they never got as low as the price I paid. So despite my own concerns about high real-estate prices, my advice to first-time buyers who want to purchase a primary residence and who can manage the down payment and monthly mortgage payments, is to ignore all this talk about an overheated market and the likelihood of a coming collapse in prices. Think of real estate less as an investment, and more as a consumer durable -- a necessity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if prices go down, you still will own an asset. If you enjoy it and can meet the monthly payments, what difference does the market value make? I feel the same way regarding people who boast about the soaring value of their homes. So what? Unless they plan to sell it now, and downsize, or move into a less expensive place (highly unlikely), they're no better or worse off than they were before prices took off. And if they're planning to trade up, the even bigger or more luxurious place down the block has appreciated even more than theirs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time buyers can take some comfort that even if they do buy at the top and prices drop, other real estate also will decline. If they want to sell, even at a loss, and trade up to something better, that new home also will have dropped in price. Whatever happens to prices, owning real estate at least puts you on the elevator. You won't be stuck waiting in the basement while everyone else ascends to the penthouse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let me emphasize that this advice goes only for first-time buyers of primary residences, though I might also make an exception for buyers who are looking for a second home for their own use and can comfortably afford the payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's true that the real-estate market isn't like the stock market: It moves in longer cycles, and it is less prone to sudden price shifts, let alone collapses. But once a negative market psychology sets in, the decline in real estate can be long and painful, as the 1991 recession made clear for many homeowners. I believe that over time, real estate returns, like those of other asset classes, will revert to their historical norm, which is a markedly lower rate of return than stocks. That means the longer the current boom keeps going, the longer, and harder, the fall.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Consumer Products Produce Split in the Industrial Sector --- Output of Cars, Furniture, Appliances Fell in April; Producer Prices Rose 0.6%</span>
</div><div class="author">By Jon E. Hilsenrath </div><div>524 words</div><div>18 May 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one sector of the economy, consumer-goods manufacturing, there really is a soft patch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday's economic reports pointed to robust economic growth, with data indicating that housing construction rebounded in April and inflation pressures built as the economy expanded. But for manufacturers of products like cars, appliances and furniture, it's a different story.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising costs and tough international competition are taking a toll. Industrial production declined 0.2% in April, the Federal Reserve said, and manufacturers of consumer products had a lot to do with it. Their output declined 0.9%, the third decline in four months, including a 3% drop in the output of automotive products and a 2.5% drop in the production of furniture, appliances and carpeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General Electric Co. last month said it would stop producing a line of midtier refrigerators at a Bloomington, Ind., plant, leaving 470 people out of work. A GE spokeswoman said the facility lost $150 million in the past three years and the product could be upgraded more cheaply in Celaya, Mexico.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Reno, Nev., Springs Industries Inc., a manufacturer of bed linens and window fashions, said it would move production of window shades and blinds to Mexico, leaving 166 U.S. employees out of work. "The competitive environment continues to get more difficult," said Ted Matthews, a spokesman for Springs. "We have to continue to find ways to improve margins and stay competitive."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such actions point to a split in the industrial sector. While production of consumer goods languishes as foreign producers take market share, production of business equipment is playing an increasingly important role in the expansion. Output of business equipment rose 0.8% in April and was up 8.4% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another report showed that the prices charged by manufacturers were going up. Producer prices rose 0.6% in April, amid rising costs for energy, tobacco and prescription drugs. The core producer-price index, which excludes food and energy items, rose 0.3%, the largest increase in three months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report was a fresh signal that some manufacturers are passing on higher raw-material costs to their customers. But here, too, manufacturers of business equipment had more leverage than manufacturers of consumer goods. Producers of capital equipment raised prices 2.9% from a year earlier, while producers of long-lasting consumer goods raised prices 1.9% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One factor constraining the consumer-goods makers is the power of big-box retailers like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Home Depot Inc. to halt price increases at their doors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Commerce Department said home builders broke ground at an increasing rate during April, plowing forward after a late-winter retreat blamed on weather. Housing starts rose 11% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.038 million units, the Commerce Department said. That marked a rebound after starts tumbled 17.6% in March to 1.836 million. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New economic reports suggest the U.S. economy is in stronger shape than it appeared to be in just a month ago. But one sector is still clearly struggling: Manufacturing of consumer products like cars, furniture and appliances.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve said industrial production fell 0.2% in April after a small increase the month before. Manufacturers of consumer products had a lot to do with it. Their output declined for the third time in four months, including a 3% April drop in the output of automotive products and a 2.5% April drop in production of furniture, appliances and carpeting.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of these industries are still battling tough import competition, most notably from low-cost producers in places like China and Mexico.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While production faced downward strain in April, the prices charged by producers were facing upward pressure. U.S. wholesale prices rose 0.6% in April, a faster pace than Wall Street expected amid a surge in prices for tobacco and prescription drugs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, energy prices rose for a third consecutive month. Overall energy prices increased 2.1% in April after a 3.3% gain in March. That partly reflected a 6.6% gain in prices of residential natural gas -- the largest increase in two years. Gasoline prices rose 2.6%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The core producer-price index, which excludes food and energy items, rose 0.3% -- the largest increase in three months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists believe wholesale-price pressures could abate in the months ahead, because the cost of raw materials has eased in recent weeks. For example, oil prices hit a record of about $58 a barrel in early April but dropped about $8 by the end of the month. "By year-end, finished-goods prices will be slowing," said Ian Shepherdson, economist with High Frequency Economics, in a note to clients.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Commerce Department said homebuilders broke ground at an increasing rate during April, plowing forward after a late-winter retreat blamed on weather. Financing costs for buyers remain low and home values are moving up.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts rose 11% last month to a seasonally adjusted 2.038 million annual rate, the Commerce Department said yesterday. March starts tumbled an unrevised 17.6% to 1.836 million, the biggest plunge in 14 years. February starts advanced 1.8% to 2.228 million. Economists, saying housing-market fundamentals remain favorable, expected that better weather on the heels of a cold, rainy, snowy March would help boost starts in April.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>449 words</div><div>17 May 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rapid home-price inflation spread to more cities in the first quarter, the National Association of Realtors said in a report released last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR found that median prices for previously occupied homes rose at double-digit rates from the year-earlier quarter in 66 of the 136 metropolitan statistical areas included in its quarterly survey. That was the highest number of double-digit gains recorded by the NAR since it began compiling such metropolitan tables more than 25 years ago. In last year's fourth quarter, 62 metro areas showed double-digit increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest increase recorded in the latest quarter was 46% in Bradenton, Fla. Florida also had two of the other biggest increases -- 36% in both Sarasota and the West Palm Beach-Boca Raton area. Other large gainers included Riverside-San Bernardino, Calif. (33%), Las Vegas (29%), Sacramento, Calif. (27%), and Atlantic City, N.J. (23%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six metro areas showed declines: Beaumont-Port Arthur, Texas (-6.5%); Canton, Ohio (-4.5%); Cedar Rapids, Iowa (-1.5%); Greenville-Spartanburg, S.C. (-0.3%); Syracuse, N.Y. (-2.6%); and Waterloo-Cedar Falls, Iowa (-2.6%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, the median price was $188,800, up 9.7% from a year earlier. David Lereah, the NAR's chief economist, said in the report that the continued surge in prices reflects a shortage of homes in many areas at a time when low interest rates are bringing more people into the market. Mr. Lereah also contends that immigration and demand for second homes from baby boomers will continue to support the market. He told a gathering of Realtors last week that he expects all but a few markets to "deflate slightly rather than pop."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report last week, Jan Hatzius, an economist at Goldman Sachs in New York, said the recent further decline in mortgage rates may have given the housing market "another lease on life." But, he said, "the risk of a sharp home-price slowdown -- and outright declines in some regional markets -- is high."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For home shoppers, it all adds up to high anxiety. Daniel Ruben Odio-Paez, who operates DROdio Realty, based in Falls Church, Va., has added a "home-value clock" to his Web site. It shows average home prices in northern Virginia ticking upward at a rate of $10.32 an hour.</p>

</div><div class="author">Dow Jones Newswires </div><div>311 words</div><div>17 May 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said manufacturing in its district "deteriorated" in May to its lowest level of activity since April 2003, although the outlook for the sector remained positive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank said its Empire State manufacturing index for May dropped to a reading of minus-11.1 versus the revised 2 seen the month before, meaning that more respondents to its survey said that business conditions had worsened compared with those who said business conditions had improved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new-orders index fell to minus-7.1 in May, from April's revised minus-1.2, meaning that more were seeing a decline in orders. The employment index softened to 0.2 in May, after April's 8.5. May's job performance was the lowest in more than 2 1/2 years, the New York Fed said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists were reluctant to read too much into the persistent softness in New York manufacturing, because the report is for just one region of the economy, and broader measures of activity recently suggest the U.S. economy isn't weakening substantially.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price pressures remained a factor for the New York area manufacturers, with May's prices-paid index holding mostly steady at 42, from April's revised 43.1, while the prices-received index in May was 8, versus 13.8 the month before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the National Association of Home Builders said its index for sales of new, single-family homes rose to 70 in May from 67 in April. When the index is over 50, it means the number of builders who see "good" sales outnumber those who see "poor" sales. "Builders have seen an uptick in traffic and sales," said association President Dave Wilson. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- In a widening push to promote price competition in sales of residential real estate, U.S. government antitrust enforcers are preparing to sue the National Association of Realtors, alleging that its policies will illegally restrict discounting of sales commissions and put online competitors at a disadvantage.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move, the latest effort by the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission aimed at protecting buyers and sellers of homes, could help take some of the sting from high real-estate costs. It comes as a hot housing market has caused prices to surge, sharply boosting income for brokers and sales agents, whose commissions typically amount to 5% to 6% of the sale price.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, sales of new and previously occupied homes totaled nearly eight million units, and commissions amounted to $61 billion, up from $42.6 billion in 2000, according to estimates by industry publication Real Trends. The median sale price for an existing home was $188,833 for the first quarter of 2005, up 41% from the same quarter of 2000 and 80% from that period in 1995, according to Thomson Datastream.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Justice Department is expected to charge that the NAR, in a proposed 2003 bylaw, illegally adopted practices intended to stifle Internet-based rivals and discounters, according to lawyers close to the case. These competitors often charge commissions below the traditional 6% that is divided between buying and selling agents.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR bylaw would allow its more than 1.2 million members to withhold their property listings from online brokers if they chose to do so. The date for it to take effect, which has been pushed back several times because of discussions with the Justice Department, now is this July. The NAR is the nation's largest trade group for brokerage firms, agents and others involved in selling real estate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government is also targeting industry-backed efforts to get state legislatures and real-estate boards, which set licensing standards, to enact regulations that in effect protect full-service real-estate agents and their commissions. Some brokers offer fixed fee-for-service, or menu, pricing that can lower consumers' costs, and others rebate a portion of the commission.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Justice Department and the FTC have warned several states in recent months that such laws hamper innovation and competition, and have formally objected to industry-supported proposals in Oklahoma and Texas.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Justice Department last month sued a Kentucky state agency that sought to restrict rebate payments to customers by residential-real-estate agents and brokers. In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Louisville, the U.S. charged that the five-member Kentucky Real Estate Commission illegally conspired to impose and enforce the rebate ban in order to fix commissions and deprive consumers of price competition by brokers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commission's executive director declined to comment on the suit. The NAR said the federal agencies are simply "lobbying on behalf of limited-service brokers" and improperly interfering in a largely state-regulated industry.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government's legal assault comes as NAR members struggle with competition from discounters, especially those using Web sites to attract customers with online listing information that used to be tightly controlled by local real-estate agents. The controversy is expected to be the hot topic at a convention of the politically powerful realtors' association, which meets in Washington this week and is scheduled to be addressed by President George W. Bush.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal investigation of the association's rules has been under way for more than a year. When it was first disclosed in October 2003, the group said it would cooperate with the inquiry and that its proposed rules regarding access to Internet listings wouldn't violate antitrust law. Late Friday, a lawyer for the group acknowledged that government officials and the association have so far been unable to resolve their differences and that a federal antitrust challenge was likely soon.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Justice Department spokeswoman Gina Talamona said antitrust enforcers are "investigating the potential competitive impact of certain rules involving the display of residential-real-estate listing data over the Internet." She declined to comment on the timing of any legal action.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Laurie Janik, general counsel for the NAR, said the residential-real-estate industry "is already highly competitive" and that "a broker who works long and hard to get listings should not be forced to share them with all of his competitors."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government lawyers are expected to allege that these bylaws let full-service real-estate firms prevent discounters who are members of a local multiple-listing service from putting some listings on their Web site.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A multiple-listing service compiles information on homes for sale in a particular area, drawing on submissions from participating brokers. MLS information isn't automatically available to consumers. Some sellers desiring privacy rely on one or more brokerage firms to find possible buyers on their own.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Janik says the government in effect "wants the discount broker with minimal inventory offering minimal service to be supplied with inventory from brokers who worked hard to get those listings."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In broad terms, the battle is about whether local brokers can claim ownership of the display of home listings in which they represent the sellers. If they lose the battle, some brokers fear, more business will begin to flow to national Web sites like LendingTree.com and RealEstate.com, both units of IAC/InterActive Corp.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commissions are shared in various ways. Typically, a listing brokerage firm aims for around 2.5% to 3% of the purchase price, divided between the firm and the agent who handled the listing; the agent who finds the buyer often expects about the same percentage cut, also split with his firm. But many agents are willing to work for less, particularly on large transactions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Janik said the dispute amounts to "a question of brokers retaining control of their listings" when they choose not to share them with certain other participants in the multiple-listing service.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A settlement is still possible. "We will have to make a decision whether to modify the policy or defend it," Ms. Janik said. If the association decides to fight the case, she added, "we're confident that a federal judge will see things our way."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Justice Department has been closely monitoring the way that local multiple-listing services are used, and for any evidence that they exclude discount brokers who offer services for less or let clients choose only services they need. The department issued civil subpoenas in Tulsa, Oklahoma, recently, seeking data on how brokers divide online listings. Separately, in its letter to the Oklahoma state legislature, the department opposed a bill that would have restricted fee-for-service pricing, in favor of the full-service real-estate services provided by traditional brokers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bill "deprives Oklahoma consumers of the benefits of competition, such as lower prices and customized service levels, provided by fee-for-service brokers," said R. Hewitt Pate, the U.S. antitrust chief.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bill "deprives Oklahoma consumers of the benefits of competition, such as lower prices and customized service levels, provided by fee-for-service brokers," said R. Hewitt Pate, the U.S. antitrust chief. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the latest sign that U.S. economic activity is moderating, the Institute for Supply Management reported that the manufacturing sector grew in April at the slowest pace in nearly two years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM, which polls purchasing managers at more than 400 industrial companies, said its index of manufacturing activity slipped to 53.3 last month, down from 55.2 in March and 55.3 in February. April was the fifth consecutive monthly decline in the index, which peaked at 61.6 last July and has trended lower ever since. A reading above 50 indicates that the manufacturing sector is expanding; a reading below 50 indicates that the sector is contracting.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the decline in the ISM index was widely viewed as disappointing news, some economists were quick to note that the reading doesn't mean that the economy is heading for recession. "The current ISM number is down quite a bit, but it's still pretty good and consistent with pretty decent growth in the economy," says Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors Inc. in Holland, Pennsylvania.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Norbert Ore, chairman of the ISM's survey committee, also played down the recent decline. He said that after 23 consecutive months of expansion in the manufacturing sector, a slowdown was inevitable. "It's important to note it's the longest run of growth in manufacturing in 16 years," he said. "There has to be some expectation that the rate of growth will decline." He attributes the slowdown to a decline in demand for durable goods and to inventory excess in the automotive sector. The new-orders index, for example, fell to 53.7 in April from 57.1 a month earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM index is closely watched by economists and investors because it provides an early look of economic activity in the preceding period and tends to track changes in the health of the U.S. industrial core. But it's not clear whether the report will have any influence on members of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee, who meet today to map out monetary policy. The central bank is widely expected to raise the target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, to 3% from 2.75%. While the economy appears to have softened in recent months, Fed officials seem to be more focused on keeping inflation from accelerating than on keeping the pace of economic growth from slowing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Commerce Department said U.S. construction spending increased 0.5%, faster than expected, to a seasonally adjusted record-high annual rate of $1.052 trillion.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. manufacturers turned in their slowest pace of growth in nearly two years in April, and they probably face slowing growth over coming months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management, a private research group, reported that its index of manufacturing activity lost ground in April, moving to a reading of 53.3, after 55.2 in March and 55.3 in February.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The April reading fell short of the 55 predicted by economists in a survey by Readings that are over 50 in the overall index and in the components indicate expanding activity.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">April's performance did help the manufacturing sector to continue building its longest period of growth in 16 years, said Norbert Ore, who directs the ISM survey. But he noted that April's growth rate was the "lowest level since July 2003" and that "the trend is definitely toward a slower pace of growth" -- a development that also could bring relief on price pressures.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some ISM survey respondents noted good business conditions, while others flagged lower steel prices and an effort to contain price gains on raw materials. The report's components were generally weaker. The research group said that its production index for April was 56.7, a minor improvement from March's 56.5. Meanwhile, the new-orders index hit 53.7, versus 57.1 in March.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hiring at factories slowed. The employment index moved down to 52.3, from March's 53.3, for an 18th straight month of positive performance. The employment index was 57.4 in February.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inflation pressures marked their 38th straight month of creeping higher. For April, the ISM's price index was 71, after 73 the month before. Inflation will be in the spotlight today as the Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM also reported that its inventories index stood at 47.9 in April, down from 54.1 the month before. Growth in inventories can sometimes lead to lower production in months ahead as manufacturers draw down stocks.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Commerce Department said U.S. construction spending increased 0.5% in March, faster than expected, to a seasonally adjusted record annual rate of $1.052 trillion. Spending rose a revised 0.5% in February compared with the previously reported 0.4%. January spending growth was also revised to 0.4% from the previously reported 0.6%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential construction spending climbed 0.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $592.8 billion, after a revised 1.1% increase in February previously reported as a 0.7% gain. Nonresidential construction spending rose 0.7% in March, following a revised 0.3% drop in February previously reported as unchanged.  </p>

While the economy appears to have softened in recent months, Fed officials seem to be more focused on keeping inflation from accelerating than on keeping the pace of economic growth from slowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 20 industries tracked by the ISM, 14 reported growth in April, including the wood, furniture and chemical industries. The five industries that reported decreased activity were apparel, paper, electronic components, textiles and printing and publishing. Petroleum was the only industry reporting the same level of activity as the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One slightly positive reading came in the prices-paid index, which was 71.0 in April, down from 73 in March. The employment index declined to 52.3 from March's 53.3, which shows that companies are adjusting to the slowdown by keeping hiring down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists were encouraged by the export-orders index, which rose to 57.2 in April from 55.4 a month earlier as the weaker dollar continues to be a driver. But overall, many thought the report was disappointing, but not unexpected. "It was consistent with the general picture that says we're going to get another quarter of economic growth that is pretty lackluster," says Joshua Shapiro, an economist at MFR Inc., a New York economic-advisory firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Commerce Department said U.S. construction spending increased 0.5%, faster than expected, to a seasonally adjusted record annual rate of $1.052 trillion. Spending rose a revised 0.5% in February compared with the previously reported 0.4%.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Energy Costs Are Taking Their Toll --- GDP Growth Rate of 3.1% Is Slowest Pace in 2 Years; Signs of Further Softening</span>
</div><div class="author">By Michael Schroeder </div><div>651 words</div><div>29 April 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising energy prices dragged U.S. economic growth to a two-year low, and there are signs it will ebb further in the coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gross domestic product, the economy's broadest snapshot of all goods and services produced, rose at a disappointing 3.1% annual rate in the first quarter, the worst performance in two years, the Commerce Department said. The pace was down from 3.8% in the fourth quarter of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are indications that the softening will extend and perhaps intensify over the middle quarters of the year," said Peter Kretzmer, senior economist at Bank of America Corp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with the Commerce Department also reporting a substantial boost in prices, the economy's slower growth isn't likely to deter the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates. Fed policy makers are expected to raise their key short-term interest rate by another quarter of a percentage point when they meet Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slower business investment and government spending have become a drag on economic growth. Capital spending advanced only 4.7% at an annual rate for the first quarter, down from 14.5% in the previous quarter, the Commerce report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business purchases of equipment and software grew at a relatively modest 6.9% pace, the weakest increase in two years. By comparison, such purchases expanded at an 18.4% pace at the end of 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the slowdown in business spending occurred amid a jump in inventories, accounting for 1.2 percentage points of the economic growth for the quarter, economists say. Businesses expanded inventories by an $80.2 billion annual rate, up from $47.2 billion in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising imports also contributed to slower domestic production. Net imports soared 14.7% to $42.1 billion in the quarter, up from 11.4% in the previous period. Exports advanced 7% in the quarter from an increase of 3.2% a quarter earlier. The gap between imports and exports reduced first-quarter growth by 1.49 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the growth in consumer spending cooled, and the personal saving rate fell to 0.6%, its second-lowest quarterly rate on record. Consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of economic activity, expanded at a still-respectable 3.5% in the first quarter, down from 4.2% in the previous period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of big-ticket products, such as cars, were flat in the first quarter compared with a 3.9% growth rate in the fourth quarter. Spending on nondurable goods rose 4.9%, down from a 5.9% increase in the prior quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the inflation front, the overall price index of purchases increased at a 3.3% annual rate in the quarter, up from 2.3% in the fourth quarter. Economists attribute some of the quarterly jump to new government pay raises and rising energy prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Closely watched by the Fed, the price index for personal-consumption expenditures, which excludes food and energy, gained at a 2.2% annual rate, up from 1.7% in the final quarter last year and the highest in more than seven years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil prices, which surged to a high of $57.27 a barrel at the beginning of April, have retreated somewhat since then. Economists expect high prices at the pump to continue at least through the summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, initial claims for unemployment benefits rose 21,000 in the week ended April 22 to 320,000. The four-week moving average fell 8,000 to a six-week low of 323,000.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of new homes in the U.S. advanced 12.2% in March to a record level as mortgage rates remained low and the nation's housing market continued to soar.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New single-family home sales increased 12.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.43 million, the U.S. Commerce Department said yesterday. It was the biggest monthly increase since sales climbed 12.6% in September 1993.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">February sales rose a revised 8.2% as the government raised the annual rate to 1.28 million from its earlier estimate of 1.23 million units.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, consumers' confidence in the U.S. economy weakened this month to the lowest point since last autumn. The Conference Board, a business research group in New York, said its overall index of consumer confidence for April now stands at 97.7 from a revised 103 in March and 104.4 in February.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists say an increase in hiring by U.S. employers and relatively low borrowing costs are propping up demand for housing. High energy prices, which are limiting economic growth, might keep a lid on interest rates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department's report showed that new-home sales increased 21.9% in the Midwest, 13.8% in the South, and 9.9% in the West. Sales fell 8.9% in the Northeast.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of homes on the market in the U.S. slipped in March to a 3.6 months' supply from February's 4.3 months' supply.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer confidence has flagged because of a mixed view on employment and the worst showing in the expectations index since the summer of 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Less robust current conditions and a more cautious outlook have consumers feeling less confident in April than in March," Conference Board economist Lynn Franco said.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Today's Market Forecast]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home Bound</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scariest phrase in investing? "It's different this time." Scarier still is when people start acting on that conceit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This appears to be happening in hot housing markets, where many buyers are justifying heavy debt loads with the belief that the rising price will bail them out if they can't keep up with payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Their attitude is: Get me into that house before the price goes up any more," says Lehman Brothers economist Ethan Harris. "Get me into that rapidly appreciating asset and if I have to, I'll sell it and make a lot of money off of it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In booming markets in places like California and Florida, Mr. Harris reckons three-quarters of new buyers take out adjustable-rate mortgages, which offer lower payments than fixed-rate mortgages -- but carry the risk of higher interest rates later. And three-quarters of those ARMs buyers are paying little or no money up front.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, 15% to 20% of the people buying in these markets are buying purely for investment, which compares to just 4% or 5% elsewhere in the country. If things went awry, those speculative buyers could bail out quickly. Mr. Harris also worries that because some speculators are operating in more than one region, a downturn in one market could cause problems elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big U.S. homebuilders, too, have been acting on the belief that the good times are going to keep on rolling, argues Greg Jensen, director of research of money-management firm Bridgewater Associates. Although their earnings rose substantially last year, he says, on balance all that money and then some went into increasing their inventory of homes to sell and land to build on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those inventories will be a boon so long as sales keep booming. In a cooler housing market, they would be a burden -- particularly if speculative buyers were forced to sell into the slowdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent signs on housing have been mixed. Last week, the Commerce Department reported that new home construction fell sharply in March; the National Association of Home Builders sentiment index also fell. But yesterday, the National Association of Realtors reported that existing-home sales rose in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists expect that today's report on March new-home sales from the Commerce Department will show a drop, but it may be just a temporary payback after a strong February. It's easy to tell that housing has become too speculative, says Mr. Harris, but it's hard to tell when the speculation will stop.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of existing homes rose 1% last month to the third-highest sales pace on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales advanced to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.89 million units last month, up from a February pace of 6.82 million units, the National Association of Realtors reported yesterday. The figure includes both single-family homes and condominiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family home sales rose 1.2% to a 6.04-million-unit rate from a rate of 5.97 million units a month earlier, the report said. Condominium sales fell 0.1% to an 845,000-unit rate last month from 846,000 in February.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Michael Schroeder </div><div>623 words</div><div>20 April 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Housing starts last month saw their steepest drop in more than 14 years, while an oil-price surge drove wholesale prices to the biggest increase in four months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts plunged 17.6% in March, as groundbreaking for both single-family and multifamily homes tumbled to 1.84 million units from a revised 2.23 million units in February, the Commerce Department said. February numbers were originally reported as 2.2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the producer-price index for finished goods rose 0.7% in March, up from 0.4% a month earlier, the Labor Department reported. But the core inflation rate, excluding food and energy, edged up 0.1% for the month, unchanged from a month earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Federal Reserve disclosed that there was more discord than previously known on its decision to raise interest rates a quarter percentage point on March 22. That day, all 12 voting members of the 19-member Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's monetary-policy panel, agreed to raise the target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, to 2.75% from 2.5%. But 10 of its 12 regional banks wanted the same-size increase in the less-important discount rate, charged on short-term Fed advances to commercial banks, according to minutes of the Fed's discount-rate deliberations released yesterday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dallas Fed wanted no change in the discount rate, and the Kansas City Fed wanted a half-point increase. The president of the Kansas City Fed doesn't have a vote on the FOMC this year and the Dallas Fed vote was cast by an alternate at last month's meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regional bank directors who wanted no rate increase cited "the cumulative" increase in rates to date and "the lag in the impact of policy actions on the economy," according to the minutes. But some bank "directors preferred to remove monetary-policy accommodation more quickly through a" half-point increase, the minutes said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regarding housing starts, economists said the March weakness appears to have been exaggerated by poor weather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts last month looked particularly weak against a robust market in February, when unseasonably good weather pushed starts to a 20-year high. Building permits, a measure of future housing demand, fell 4% to 2.02 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The gap between housing starts and permits . . . is notably large and suggests that housing starts will rebound in April," said Gary Bigg, an economist at Banc of America Securities LLC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts were down across the nation, falling 29.3% in the Midwest, 18% in the South, 12.7% in the West and 3.6% in the Northeast, the Commerce Department said. But continued low mortgage rates are expected to support a strong housing market for several months, economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, energy prices rose 3.3%, while gasoline prices rose 5.3%, the Labor Department said. Meanwhile, crude-oil prices have ballooned 40% during the past year. But food prices rose more slowly, climbing 0.3% last month after a 0.8% gain in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Core wholesale-price inflation has remained in check, with prices up 2.6% in the 12 months that ended in March, down from 2.8% for the year through February, the Labor Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices of passenger cars fell for a second consecutive month, dropping 0.2% after a 0.9% drop in February. Computer prices fell 3.4% after a 0.4% increase in February.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHEN GRAEME GLADE decided to sell his Hawaiian ocean-view home recently, he didn't list it locally, figuring few people would get to tiny Haleiwa on north Oahu to see his "For Sale" sign. He also passed over national advertisements, figuring there's a limited pool of U.S. buyers ready to pay his $3.75 million asking price. Instead, he put his home on a Web site that specializes in international listings, and so far he's fielded inquiries from Japan to the Netherlands.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My home seems expensive to the locals," says Mr. Glade, a building subcontractor who did get a few nibbles from Americans, but is considering a bid from a British citizen. "But to foreigners, it's a bargain."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With an eye on the weak dollar, American homeowners are increasingly seeking out buyers who come not from around the block or even a nearby town -- but from other countries altogether. And foreigners, hoping for a deal, are more eager than ever to buy here. The upshot: The residential real-estate market is getting a small shot of globalization.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unique Homes, a U.S.-listing publication with distribution in 80 countries, has seen foreign Web hits more than double in the past year, while DuPont Registry of Homes in Florida says demand by foreign distributors for its luxury magazine is up 12% from last year. Meanwhile, in part to pitch more U.S. homes to people in other countries, New Jersey-based Century 21 has expanded to 43 countries, up from 36 two years ago, and property broker Christie's Great Estates in New Mexico is planning moves into South America and Asia.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the fact that buying homes -- and even quickly reselling them -- continues at a fervid pace, it would seem that U.S. homeowners wouldn't have to go abroad to find buyers. But in places like California's Orange County and New York, prices have climbed so high that the pool of potential purchasers has actually shrunk -- to folks who already own homes in the area and have built up equity, or who have quick access to a lot of cash. Expanding a sales pitch to foreigners, especially those whose native currency has risen against the dollar, can help pick up the slack. Another bonus: Since foreigners find it more difficult to get financing here, they tend to pay all cash.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet international buyers come with their own set of issues. In cases where a buyer does need a mortgage, U.S. and foreign banks tend to drag the process out as they check credit ratings and financial information abroad and at home. It's also standard protocol in other countries to "lowball" a property, typically offering about half of what a home is listed for. That means that haggling can take on a larger role, with some foreign buyers bargaining up to the very end. "Don't be surprised if the buyer asks for the Ferrari at the closing table," says Olivia Hsu Decker, a broker in San Francisco.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While there can always be odd demands in real-estate transactions, they sometimes get exaggerated by cultural differences, as Michael and Karen Carroll discovered while fielding proposals for a five-bedroom oceanfront home in North Carolina, (asking price: $7.4 million). One buyer from Australia proposed via e-mail that the Carrolls swap their home for his 1,000-acre ranch. "I can't go flying around the world trying to figure out what someone else's property is worth," says Ms. Carroll, who is still looking for a buyer after turning down offers from the U.S. and abroad.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ken Knowles has gotten even stranger requests. Since putting his Kentucky home on the international market for $1.2 million a month ago, the electronics-firm owner has received an offer from a shopper in Mexico who asked that a caretaker be included in the deal and an Australian who wanted Mr. Knowles's grand piano and backyard lawn tractor. "I never realized I'd have to sift through so much mumbo-jumbo," says Mr. Knowles, who is still looking for a buyer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While no one keeps records of how many foreign buyers are entering the U.S. market, brokers say foreigners prefer resorts or second-homes markets over most major cities. According to the National Association of Realtors, a record 2.82 million second homes were sold in 2004, up 16.3% from the year before. Those purchases were more affordable for foreigners whose buying power has increased: The Canadian dollar has risen 30% against the U.S. dollar over the past three years; the euro is up 50% over the same period, and the Australian dollar has jumped 39%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all sellers are casting abroad for buyers, of course, but the concept is catching on -- and could grow if U.S. interest rates continue to rise, as they did recently. In that scenario, the dollar would likely strengthen, economists say, but more U.S. residents who couldn't afford an interest-rate increase would get squeezed out.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, many real-estate businesses are stepping up outreach efforts. Later this year, Century 21 plans to roll out an online service that will hook up a foreign buyer with a U.S.-based agent who speaks his language. (Once the buyer finds an American property on the company's site, he will be able to fill out an online form that will be forwarded via the site to a U.S.-based agent who speaks his language; the agent will follow up.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To encourage real-estate agents to cooperate more across borders, the National Association of Realtors launched a program in November that has begun registering agents world-wide, if they pass a new online exam in NAR's database. (The idea is that sellers will trust a foreign agent with the certification and be more likely to pursue a deal.) So far, 150 agents have registered.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even builders are trying to cash in. Marshal Rothman, a builder in California, just sold a six-bedroom home to a British couple for $4.5 million, after advertising on a free Internet site. In Florida, Realmark Group has started targeting foreigners with ads in Lufthansa inflight magazines; it also posts signs and ads near the exit at the nearby Fort Myers International Airport. "We don't want to miss anybody," says Will Stout, the company's American-born owner. The company says about 15% of its buyers are foreigners, up from 10% two years ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But reaching buyers who live abroad isn't always easy. Because most foreign countries don't have multiple-listing services, simply getting your house in front of the public can be challenging. What's more, some brokerage firms that work with foreigners have pretty high standards dollarwise -- homes listed by Christie's average $5 million -- and tend to work in only a select number of states. For their part, foreign buyers complain that U.S. Web sites provide ample listings, but can skimp on practical information about financing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it can be just as hard to snag a foreign buyer willing to pay your price as it is to find an American one. In spite of a flurry of inquiries from Europeans at the end of last year, real-estate broker Mercedes Huff in Wyoming says no deals ever materialized. The pickings have been even slimmer in Los Angeles, according to broker Jeff Hyland. "We haven't seen Europeans take advantage of the dollar here. I'm still waiting for it."  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE HOUSING MARKET may be red-hot in most places, but newly constructed homes are beginning to pile up in some Midwestern and Southern cities, forcing builders to offer incentives to lure prospective buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the current weakness is in the market for moderately priced or entry-level homes. So far, sales are slowing mainly in areas where population and job growth have been relatively weak, such as Ohio, which has lost more jobs than any other state since 2000. Other lackluster markets include Michigan, Indiana and Kentucky. The Midwest economies have been hurt by problems in manufacturing, partly tied to the automobile industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, home sales remain red-hot, and few economists expect the problems in the Midwest to spill over to the rest of the country -- at least not anytime soon. With the national job picture relatively healthy, real-estate experts expect sales to remain brisk overall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, oversupply is hitting some markets with a robust employment picture. Charlotte, N.C., for instance, currently has a job growth rate of 3.5% -- higher than the national average. But so many builders moved into the Charlotte market hoping to capitalize on the expanding economy that competition for buyers has become fierce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent softness has forced builders to offer an array of incentives to attract new buyers, ranging from small perks, such as swanky blinds, to ones valued at thousands of dollars. Developers are offering to pay closing costs, upgrade kitchens at no charge, subsidizing down payments, landscape the property or install air conditioning, or offer additional parking spaces in smaller subdivisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders have periodically had to resort to incentive programs to keep sales brisk, even in hot markets. The latest round, though, is mostly focused on entry-level homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a period of lackluster stock-market returns, the strong housing market has been a big driver of both the economy and individual wealth. The National Association of Realtors reported this week that its index of pending home sales -- those for which contracts have been signed but transactions aren't completed -- in February was up 10% from a year earlier. The group also has reported that the national median price for previously occupied homes was $191,000 in February, up 11% from a year before. (In one hot market -- Los Angeles -- median home prices have shot up 166% during the past five years, by some estimates.) For all of 2004, there was a 4.3-month supply of homes available for sale, the lowest annual supply on record, the association said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problems in certain regions are a reminder that the housing market is dependent on local economies, which can vary. "What goes on in Las Vegas really has nothing to do with goes on in northern Virginia," says Mike Castleman Sr., chairman and chief executive of housing-market research firm Metrostudy in Houston. "It's really the local builders, the local employers and the local job market that determines how the housing market will perform in that particular area."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amy Merrill says "it's a buyer's market" in the Akron, Ohio, area. The 43-year-old owner of a marketing and research company has been looking for a home priced at around $175,000 since January. "There's a new `for sale' sign popping up every day," she says, and that provides her with a wide array of options and allows her to be picky. "I've had no problem in terms of the number of homes I have to choose from, so I'm going to wait until I find the right home at the right price."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Detroit area, sellers of entry-level homes "are doing everything but hiring strippers to sell their homes," says Susan Carter, Realtor and associate broker at Woodwardside GMAC Real Estate in Royal Oak, Mich. In the late 1990s, Ms. Carter says, it would take her four to six weeks to sell a home. Now she tells sellers it will take closer to two to three months. This is leading sellers to offer to pay for closing costs or additional commissions to the selling agent -- anything to sell their house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising interest rates could further dissuade first-time home buyers -- typically the first group to feel that pinch. "Existing homeowners or trade-up buyers can use some of their housing equity to make moves, but it's the first-time buyers who will be generally more impacted when rates rise," says Lawrence Yun, a senior economist with the National Association of Realtors. According to Freddie Mac, the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage was 6.04% last week, up from an average of 5.52% a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the nation's biggest builders, the weakness in the Midwest isn't likely to damp earnings. For smaller builders, it is becoming an issue. Rockford Homes, a Columbus, Ohio, home builder whose houses have an average price of $220,000, says sales have declined 10% since last year. The economy in the city remained relatively stable throughout the downturn, according to Don Wick, Rockford's executive vice president, but that stability attracted too many home builders, which has led to a crowded market at the lower end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company has started to offer such incentives as $5,000 of free upgrades to prospective buyers. Mr. Wick says that while the company did hit its sales target in March, it happened on the very last day of the month. "All over the state, builders are cutting their [profit] margins, offering incentives and increasing their marketing," he says. "That's an indication that something is wrong."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beazer Homes USA Inc. of Atlanta, one the country's biggest builders, recently said it will take a $131 million goodwill-impairment charge related to the acquisition of another home builder in 2002 that operated mainly in North Carolina, Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio. The company, which builds mainly entry-level homes in those regions, said its business in those areas is suffering in part from "severe price competition" and weak local economies. The company still is projected to report strong earnings this year, as a result of strength in other markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some builders that have suffered are expecting things to turn around soon. Jim Harmon, president of Amber Homes in Aurora, Colo., says his sales declined 50% from the 1999 peak to the company's lowest point in 2003. To lure buyers, his company has offered to pay for closing costs, upgrade appliance and provide outside landscaping as added incentives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, Amber Homes, which sells mostly entry-level homes, expects business to increase at least 30% by the end of its fiscal year in June. One reason, adds Mr. Harmon, is that the flat housing market has attracted a spate of small businesses to the area since it is easy for employees to find place to live. That has propelled job growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For potential buyers, this is a welcome trend. Sheri and Joseph Bruno, a Denver couple, started looking for homes in the $350,000 to $380,000 price range last September, and found a surplus of available houses. But many of the newer homes were "highly overpriced, cookie-cutter type of homes," and the couple refused to settle for less than what they wanted, says Ms. Bruno, a 39-year-old dental hygienist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, after viewing 98 homes, the Brunos found a four-bedroom home in their price range, but only after they expanded their search to include homes that were built in the 1980s. "We finally found a house with good character and good karma, but it wasn't easy," Ms. Bruno says. "There were a lot of houses available, but not a lot of desirable ones, so we were surprised that some were asking for top dollar."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the Grinch who stole Christmas, the Taliban once banned the popular holiday of Nowroz, the first day of the Afghan year. A few weeks ago, people all around Afghanistan got the chance to celebrate[http://www.afghannews.net/index.php?action=show&amp;type=news&amp;id=2242target=_blank], for the fourth time in their free country, a new beginning. "The new year arrived with snows and rains. May it be full of peace and security as well," Allah Mohammad, a resident of Kabul, said, expressing a popular sentiment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Considering how much snow fell on Afghanistan this winter, wishing for an equal bounty of peace, security and prosperity might be somewhat optimistic. But even a moderate precipitation of good and stable government and economic growth will guarantee that this war-shattered, impoverished and traumatized country continues its slow and often painful--yet at the same time very inspiring--ascent from the nightmare of the past 25 years of its history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Below are some snapshots from that journey that no longer attracts much media attention, but one that, nonetheless, matters a lot not only to the Afghans themselves but also all those around the world who believe in the redeeming power of freedom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Society. After delays caused by logistical problems, Afghanistan's first parliamentary election[http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/0321afghan21.htmltarget=_blank] is scheduled to take place on Sept. 18[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/ISL16119.htm]:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fifty political parties, many of them run by former mujahideen who fought the Soviets and the Taliban have registered to contest the polls so far. . . . These elections will be more complex than the presidential election, as the commission will probably have to deal directly with several thousand candidates, said Julian Type, from the [electoral] commission's operational planning unit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joining the exodus from warlordism to democratic politics[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_28-3-2005_pg4_26target=_blank] are a pair of famous figures:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two of Afghanistan's most powerful northern warlords have laid down their arms to enter politics as the country prepares for its first parliamentary elections. The militias of ethnic Uzbek warlord General Abdul Rashid Dostam and his Tajik rival Mohammed Atta have clashed repeatedly in and around Mazar-i-Sharif since the fall of the Taliban in late 2001.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But calm has descended on this northern city as both men look to build political power bases. "There are always underlying tensions, but no major problems lately. Dostum and Atta wanted to be legitimate," said Captain Tim Rawlinson of the city's British-run Provincial Reconstruction Team, part of NATO's peacekeeping mission in the north.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To stand in the September 18 parliamentary elections, candidates must prove they are not linked to an armed group and although commanders such as Atta and Dostam still have ties to their militias, they have disarmed most of their men as part of a UN-backed disarmament drive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is how the election will work out in practice[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2005/3/3CE22734-E279-486F-A52C-D93832A241A1.htmltarget=_blank]:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The voting will include ballots for Afghanistan's 34 provincial assemblies as well as the "Wolesi Jirga," or People's Assembly--the lower house of Afghanistan's bicameral parliament. . . .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will not be possible this year to conduct more complicated local elections for district councils within each province. "Due to some technical and logistical problems, we cannot hold the district-council elections this year," [Bismillah] Bismil [chairman of the Afghan-U.N. Joint Electoral Management Body] said. "It is up to the Wolesi Jirga [to resolve outstanding issues related to] the borders of the districts. And then we shall be able to finalize the dates for the district council elections."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the Afghan Constitution, the Afghan president appoints one-third of the members of parliament's upper house--known as the Mushrano Jirga, or Assembly of Elders. The provincial assemblies and local district councils within each province also elect delegates from among their members.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the lack of district councils has forced the Joint Electoral Management Board to improvise. It says a temporary upper house will be created so the parliament can function until district elections are held. Under that system, there will be 51 representatives in the temporary upper house. Each of the 34 provincial assemblies elected in September will send one representative. The remaining 17 seats--one-third of the total--will be appointed by Afghan President Hamid Karzai. The registration of candidates[http://www.sabawoon.com/news/miniheadlines.asp?dismode=article&amp;artid=21911target=_blank] for parliamentary election will begin on April 26 and will continue for three weeks. Peter Erben, a member of the Joint Electoral Management Body, expects between 5,000 and 10,000 candidates to run for 249 seats:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Voters in the presidential elections of last year could cast their votes wherever they wanted but in the parliamentary elections they will have to vote in the constituencies where they registered. . . . A one-month voter registration campaign would be launched for those who did not register during the presidential elections or were not eligible then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Erben said there would be 30,000 polling stations and 5,000 constituencies all over Afghanistan with 187,000 staff working on the voting day. Around 4,300 Afghan employees and 425 internationals will be working to enhance public awareness in parts of the country about how to vote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, Afghanistan's next budget[http://www.sabawoon.com/news/miniheadlines.asp?dismode=article&amp;artid=21733target=_blank] has been unveiled:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Afghanistan's annual budget for the year 2005-2006 has been increased by 15% over last year with nearly 50% of the budget being allocated for security related expenditure. The Ministries of Interior and Defense, entrusted with the task of securing the war torn country internally as well as externally have been given 44% of the $678 [million[ annual budget (32.833 billions Afs) for the year 2005-2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While good government is essential to the future of Afghanistan, the U.S. Agency for International Development is helping with the development of another aspect of a healthy polity: civil society[http://www.usaid.gov/locations/asia_near_east/afghanistan/weeklyreports/032505_report.htmltarget=_blank]:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A strong civil society in Afghanistan will create stability, build local government accountability, and provide a public framework for upcoming national elections. The I-PACS (Initiative to Promote Afghan Civil Society) program, launched in January 2005, focuses on building a strong, sustainable civil society in Afghanistan by supporting the enactment of a NGO law, capacity building through training and mentoring, and small grant funding for CSOs (Civil Society Organizations). CSOs include, but are not limited to: NGOs, social and cultural organizations, associations, shuras (community elders), CDCs (Community Development Councils), women and youth groups, unions, and cooperatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lot of Afghan women is also slowly--but steadily--improving as many new opportunities open up for the previously downtrodden half of the population. A few weeks ago, Afghan activists celebrated  International Women's Day[http://www.iwpr.net/index.pl?archive/arr/arr_200503_165_3_eng.txttarget=_blank]:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Intercontinental Hotel in Kabul buzzed with excitement . . . as more than 500 men and women, some of the latter stylishly dressed and even a few without the once-obligatory headscarf, marked International Women's Day. The highlight of the March 8 event, sponsored by the United Nations Development Fund for Women, UNIFEM, and the ministry of women's affairs, and funded by the Afghan government along with France, South Korea and Japan, was a rare appearance by Dr Zeenat Karzai, accompanying her husband President Hamed Karzai, who was the keynote speaker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a good occasion to highlight achievements:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are 35,000 women now employed in the country's 30 ministries. Three hold key positions. And Habiba Sorabi recently became the first woman to hold the post of governor after she was appointed head of Bamian province by the president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Participants also focused on the many challenges still ahead. Says Youth Minister Amena Afzali: "We are impatient to win our rights, the rights that are guaranteed to us by Islam. But in this country, even giving birth to a girl is considered a kind of shame. That is not Islam."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To maintain momentum in this area, the Afghan government has recently launched an extensive three-month consultation process between its ministries and numerous nongovernmental organizations. The National Plan of Action for the Women of Afghanistan[http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/MHII-6AW2MG?OpenDocumenttarget=_blank], as it's officially called, aims to develop further strategies for protecting women's rights in the new Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A high-level delegation[http://www.usaid.gov/locations/asia_near_east/afghanistan/weeklyreports/031805_report.htmltarget=_blank] led by the Minister of Women's Affairs, Masoouda Jalal, visited Washington to further underline the importance of strengthening women's rights and creating opportunities for Afghan women:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The delegation met with the President and Mrs. Bush, Secretary of State [Condoleezza] Rice, Under Secretary of State [Paula] Dobriansky, House and Senate members, Deputy Secretary of Defense [Paul] Wolfowitz, civil society organizations, and the press.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Jalal said: "In Afghanistan, we women have our rights: they are guaranteed in the new Constitution. But the reality in Afghanistan is that women will never find equality unless they have education and health care."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which is why the work of USAID is so important in so many different areas, such as this program to increase Afghan women's participation[http://www.usaid.gov/locations/asia_near_east/afghanistan/weeklyreports/030405_report.html] in civil society:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To increase the impact and foster capacity building of women's role in civil society, USAID recently launched its three-year Initiative to Promote Afghan Civil Society (I-PACS). The program provides training and mentoring for capacity building of small civil society organizations (CSOs). I-PACS has set aside $5 million for small grants to enable qualifying non-governmental organizations, groups, associations and community institutions to foster political participation, income-generation, health education, and advocacy. At least 50% of these grants will go to women-focused and women-led organizations. The first grants, to women-led NGOs, were awarded in February 2005. USAID is also donating $2.5 million[http://www.washtimes.com/upi-breaking/20050314-025249-6187r.htmtarget=_blank] directly to the Ministry of Women's Affairs "to boost public awareness of women's issues and increase social justice for Afghan women." As the report notes, "USAID has provided more than $50 million to support the women of Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fortunately, all these efforts are not restricted to the relatively cosmopolitan Kabul and are spreading outside the capital[http://www.e-ariana.com/ariana/eariana.nsf/0/9202B2FDA01CB5F487256FBF005624CA?OpenDocumenttarget=_blank]:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[The] inauguration of a government building may not usually be a cause for commemoration. However when it's a building for a branch of the Ministry of Women in a far-flung province, it is an occasion for celebration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, 17 Women's Resource Centers[http://www.usaid.gov/locations/asia_near_east/afghanistan/weeklyreports/030405_report.htmltarget=_blank] are being built in provincial capitals by USAID under the Ministry's auspices. And more is being done throughout the country to educate women about the electoral process[http://www.afghannews.net/index.php?action=show&amp;type=news&amp;id=2202target=_blank]:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Afghan women's civil association has introduced seminars in the rural provinces of the country aimed at informing women about their role in the forthcoming parliamentary elections and their right to choose suitable representation. The head of the women's civil association, Hosay Andar [said] that the seminar was also hoping to help women understand the qualities and qualifications required of women in parliamentary representation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A first for the fighting women of Afghanistan[http://www.afghansportsfederation.org/news_world_girls_kungfu.htm]: "Twelve girls from the southwestern province of Helmand are preparing to launch an all girls Kung Fu Twa team in the provinces."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Women are also finally getting behind the wheel[http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticle.asp?xfile=data/todaysfeatures/2005/March/todaysfeatures_March15.xml§ion=todaysfeaturestarget=_blank], such as this one in Herat:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sitting behind the steering wheel of her red 4x4 Toyota, Sina Shireen gets a kick out of being one of the first women in this western Afghan city to throw off her burqa and learn how to drive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The diminutive 22-year-old may be hard to see behind the tinted windows of the massive car but three years ago she had to be completely shrouded in an all-encompassing blue burqa even to leave the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The most joyful moments of my life are when I'm driving--I love it," Shireen says, the excitement visible on her face as she finally gets to do what the country's male motorists take for granted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High school student Shireen is taking part at the first ever-driving course in Herat, Afghanistan's most prosperous city, which was launched in early February by the traffic department, under the auspices of the new governor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in another small and symbolic victory[http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/archive/2005/March/22/style/stories/01style.htmtarget=_blank] for Afghan women:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">UC Santa Cruz graduate Masuda Rahmati Diaz may not have won a crown during the Mrs. World contest in India, but she won a newfound respect and love for others and a chance to make a bit of history for Afghan women, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Masuda, who is a real estate agent in Carmel [Calif.], was chosen as Mrs. Afghanistan 2005, the first woman from her country to enter the Mrs. World pageant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Married to Rene Diaz, who founded S.A. Commerce LLC, a multi-million-dollar fresh cut-flower importing business, Masuda decided to enter the pageant as Mrs. Afghanistan to show the women of her native country change is possible, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Masuda left Kabul as a child when her wealthy family was forced to leave the country and eventually settled in the United States where she had to learn English and the ways of a whole new culture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees is beginning the next phase[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/IRIN/a61e90cc672680821a462cebc370138f.htmtarget=_blank] of the voluntary repatriation of Afghan refugees from Pakistan to Afghanistan, under which 400,000 refugees are expected to return over the next 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">UNHCR officials are hopeful that the repatriation operation will gather momentum towards the end of the month, as harsh winter conditions that have affected Afghanistan and Pakistan's northwestern areas ease. Each returning Afghan on the scheme gets up to US $30 in travel grant. An additional $12 per person is paid to help with integration. All payments are made to returnees at UNHCR encashment centres inside Afghanistan. Last year more than 384,000 Afghans returned from Pakistan to Afghanistan under the voluntary repatriation programme. UNHCR expects about 400,000 Afghans to voluntarily repatriate during 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One local authority is trying to assist the returnees[http://www.southasianmedia.net/cnn.cfm?id=191438&amp;category=Human%20Rights&amp;Country=AFGHANISTANtarget=_blank]:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The provincial government in the eastern province of Kunar says it plans to hand out 54 acres of land to returnees from Pakistan, who have settled in Pashad, Khas Kunar and Sawkai district. The governor of Kunar, Asadullah Wafa, said the land will be distributed for the purposes of building houses for the homeless people, after consulting with local elders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We returned here because we believe our country needs us for the reconstruction effort," says one of the returnees, Sayed Gul. "Thank God the Afghan government paid attention to our problems and promised to give us plots of land."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, for those most in need, "the Afghan Red Crescent Society has distributed food[http://www.southasianmedia.net/cnn.cfm?id=194784&amp;category=Social%20Sectors&amp;Country=AFGHANISTANtarget=_blank] worth 600,000 afghanis ($14,000) to 287 refugee families who have returned from Pakistan and Iran."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can also read this story of an Afghan family, one among one million Afghans, returning home[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/UNHCR/1acb051cf51fee604fc1896f44209aec.htmtarget=_blank] after 25 years in Iran.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Ali, the decision to return home after more than a quarter of a century was a complex one, based on his belief that conditions in Afghanistan were improving and his perception that he faced growing obstacles in Iran.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the massive disruption of the Soviet occupation, the civil war and the Taliban's tyranny, there is a lot of ground to be made up in education. Among many other organizations, USAID has been working hard to expand educational opportunities[http://www.usaid.gov/locations/asia_near_east/afghanistan/weeklyreports/031105_report.htmltarget=_blank] across the country:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of its overall objective to create conditions for stability, USAID is increasing access to education by training teachers, distributing supplies, and reconstructing schools. The Afghanistan Primary Education Program (APEP) provides accelerated education to over-age learners who were denied primary education during the Taliban era, as well as training for teachers through specialized courses at each grade level and nationwide radio-based teacher training broadcasts. APEP also prints textbooks for primary and secondary schools throughout Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of APEP's program, Master Trainers teach provincial counterparts who in turn train village teachers. This "cascade method" provides quality training at each grade level to 6,969 teachers of APEP's accelerated learning classes. On February 21st, approximately 150 of the Ministry of Education's Master Trainers completed training. Additional Master Trainer programs are being planned to meet the needs of the 30 teachers who were unable to reach Kabul due to the severe winter weather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, this reporting period, 422 additional students in Sari Pul Province enrolled in APEP's Accelerated Learning programs. These additional enrollments bring the overall figure to 170,268--above the original target of 170,000 students. To support the expansion of the education system, USAID is building schools--137 schools have been constructed, and an additional 279 are underway. Record snowfall, however, has significantly slowed the rate of school construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">USAID is also helping women who missed out during the Taliban years to catch up on their education[http://www.usaid.gov/locations/asia_near_east/afghanistan/weeklyreports/030405_report.htmltarget=_blank]:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the years of missed schooling, in 2003 USAID established an accelerated learning program in which over-age, out of school girls can advance two grades per year. There are currently 170,000 students enrolled, of which 56% are female-compared with government schools where enrollment is 35% girls. Across 17 provinces the program has trained 6800 teachers, of which 40% are women, for this accelerated learning program.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In particular, significant progress has been made in working with and training the nine Supreme Court Judges. USAID has trained Supreme Court administrative staff and is upgrading records management which, among other things, will allow the Supreme Court to track the training needs of local-level judges.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This innovative accelerated health-focused literacy program is designed to help reduce maternal and child mortality. With 90% female illiteracy in rural areas, there are few women to become healthcare workers. Yet generally, only women can treat women in these cultures. Learning for Life builds literacy skills for 8,000 primarily young rural women and older girls, of which 5,500 are being selected and trained as community healthcare workers, community midwives and midwives. The link with health and hygiene makes literacy relevant to something a woman cares about most-her family's health-which motivates participation and retention of new literacy skills and health practices.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AINA Photo was established in 2002 by AINA, a non-profit association founded in France in August 2001 by Iranian-born photographer Reza.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The core of the new agency's professionals came from Afghanistan's first school of photo-journalism, founded in 2002 by Iranian-born international press photographer Manoocher Deghati.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's an essential precaution on the rock-strewn links of the Kabul Golf Club, which reopened on the outskirts of Afghanistan's capital last spring after more than two decades of war and neglect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the rest of the country, the government-owned course is something of a work in progress. Landscapers have dragged away most of the weapons and shrapnel that littered the grounds, though a rusted Russian tank still stands sentry atop one of several hills ringing the course. A large metal shipping container has been brought in to replace the old clubhouse, now a bombed-out shell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Abdul, the club's director in addition to its pro, has also built a water hazard. Someday soon, he hopes to fill it with water. The rough, at least, is world-class.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the challenges posed by the nine-hole course, about 100 diplomats, aid workers and other foreigners paid a small fee to golf here last year. With the club's second season about to begin, Abdul, a slim, athletic-looking man in his 40s, is keen to attract a larger crowd.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If I could get funds from the Americans or maybe the British, I could put a fence all around the course to keep the foreigners safe," he said. "Then we will need a well, so we can grow grass, and plumbing so we can build a new clubhouse.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Reconstruction. The Associated Press paints this picture of Afghanistan[http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=616057target=_blank] more than three years after liberation:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a generation of conflict, Afghans are slowly emerging from darkness. In the afterglow of last fall's presidential election, there is hope in Kabul.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Violence in the capital is now rare. Record numbers of children, including girls, are returning to rebuilt schools. U.S. trainers are forging a multiethnic Afghan army. Aid money is flowing in, and relief groups are helping put the health service and other institutions back on their feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, three years after America invaded Afghanistan following the Sept. 11 terror attacks, and the quick fall of the Taliban regime, Kabul remains a city of struggle. It is a place where life is hard, and where many promises have yet to be met. Poverty, unemployment and underdevelopment still continue to plague Afghanistan--and considering where Afghanistan is starting from, they're likely to do so for many years--but the country is finally moving ahead:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each morning before dawn, thousands of men offer themselves up at day laborer markets, carrying their paintbrushes, wheelbarrows and trowels and hoping to be among the lucky ones chosen to earn $6 and a breakfast of bread and green tea for a day's work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of that work is rebuilding the city's devastated infrastructure. Electricity supplies are improving, but much of the city is still without sewage systems or telephone service. Entrepreneurs with mobile or satellite phones power them from car batteries, selling call time by the minute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the city, workers dig neck-deep trenches looking for damaged power lines, while others give a fresh coat of paint to bomb-damaged mosques. The city's streets are congested with men pushing heavy bricks and building materials on carts among the sport utility vehicles of relief workers, government officials, diplomats and drug profiteers. There is more help for Afghan small businesses[http://www.iwpr.net/index.pl?archive/arr/arr_200503_163_3_eng.txttarget=_blank], which is likely to fuel the recovery over the long term:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Farmers, shopkeepers and private individuals in northern Afghanistan are being encouraged to apply for small loans as the country's first credit union project gets under way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the banking system in disarray outside the capital Kabul, many people have no credit facilities other than moneylenders who may charge up to 50 per cent a month in interest. . . .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Afghanistan has seen a number of donor-funded microfinance schemes designed to help poor people start businesses, but the new scheme is the first to create something approximating to a cooperative bank, offering services such as savings, loans, and even plastic cards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States-based World Council of Credit Unions, WOCCU, recently opened the first in a planned series of credit union branches in the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif, with another to follow in Shiberghan province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project is funded by the Microfinance Investment and Support Facility for Afghanistan, MISFA, an Afghan government agency which is overseeing microfinance projects. WOCCU, with headquarters in Madison, Wisconsin, has been operating for more than 30 years running similar programmes in 85 countries, with 123 million members worldwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the Afghan branch has attracted more than 1,000 members. Credit unions work as a cooperative, offering financial services to anyone who joins and obeys the rules such as saving regularly and repaying loans on time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a USAID-supported initiative[http://www.southasianmedia.net/cnn.cfm?id=191436&amp;category=Economy&amp;Country=AFGHANISTAN]:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A traders and carpet-weavers association is to be created by an American consultancy firm, On the Frontiers (OTF) in the northern city of Mazar in Baghlan province. . . . The incentive is seen by Afghan businessmen and industrialists as a positive step towards helping the carpet weaving trade and industry co-ordinate their commercial affairs throughout the country. . . . The goal behind creating this association is to encourage unification, and coordination among the business community in the carpet, dry fruit and marble industry in Afghanistan.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">75% of all Afghans live in rural areas, and most families are very poor and undernourished. Multiple USAID programs are increasing skills training for women and access to resources. In one initiative, 11,000 women have been trained in poultry technology and management, with 55,800 chicks distributed to increase family incomes and nutrition. 5,000 more women will join the program in 2005. In another effort, USAID and Development Works Canada have joined to develop a vegetable dehydration factory that employs 400 women. Some 1,400 farm families, using female home labor, will supply the factory with various produce. Microcredit programs across the country specifically target women. 6,000 women received micro loans in 2004 with USAID funds, with an average loan size of $550. . . .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">USAID has supported the Women Entrepreneurship Development (WED) program through the Ministry of Commerce since August 2003. WED has helped create significant breakthroughs for Afghan businesswomen. It established the 400 female member Afghan Women Business Association (AWBA), which has introduced women's products locally and internationally, assisted ten women to sign export contracts, supported creation of the first "Afghan Women and Business" magazine, and trained 380 women in basic and advanced business courses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">USAID will be working on another important aspect[http://www.usaid.gov/locations/asia_near_east/afghanistan/weeklyreports/031805_report.html] of Afghanistan's legal-economic structure:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Proper ownership records are an essential foundation for economic growth. A real estate title is the most common form of collateral for commercial lending which, in turn, supports new business start-ups, business expansion and education. Working in cooperation with shuras and other Afghan institutions, the LTERA (Land Titling &amp; Economic Restructuring in Afghanistan) project will identify broadly acceptable, easy-to-implement methods of formalizing property ownership in order to improve tenure security of urban dwellers. Tenure insecurity is a constant concern for many Afghans, the majority of whom have no legal title to their homes.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">USAID is funding the $12 million road, and Louis Berger Corp is working with the Afghan government on the first phase of the project--covering the first 20 km of the 70-km road into the heart of the valley.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kakrag village is in a remote and mountainous area in central Afghanistan that is home to Hazaras and Tajiks. In consultation with both Tajik and Hazara communities, USAID identified a bridge and retaining wall as high-priority needs for both communities. Because there was no bridge to cross the river, people from the Hazara village, located above Kakrag, were forced to cross the Tajik villagers' farmland with their carts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the continual traffic across the farmland damaged the fields and crops, relations between the Hazaras and the Tajiks in the area were strained. The bridge was successfully completed and awaits hand-over to the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development in Bamiyan.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The country is very traditional, and they've always worked their problems through jirgas, and they have elders come and discuss their problems," Deputy Minister Nageeba Shareef said. "Basically this was the same thing."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S.-led coalition lost 20 to 25 soldiers in the past year, Olson said. About 117 American troops have died in Afghanistan since late 2001, with slightly more than half killed in action. Lt. Gen David Barno[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/SP26211.htmtarget=_blank] agrees: "We have seen just in the last six months, since the elections in October, a dramatic downturn in enemy activity. . . . In the month of February we saw the lowest level of enemy attacks."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The amnesty programs run by the Afghan authorities and the coalition are also bearing fruit, most recently with the surrender in Zabul province of a senior Taliban commander Mullah Amanullah[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-03/27/content_2750312.htmtarget=_blank]. You can also read this interview with Habibullah Fawzi[http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/pp030705a.shtmltarget=_blank], a former Taliban diplomat at the Afghan Embassy in Riyadh, who was one of four senior former Taliban members to accept a recent amnesty offer by the Afghan government. And here's an overview[http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/world/3093562target=_blank] of recent Afghan and American efforts to bring some of the Taliban from the cold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As their enemy weakens, Afghan troops continue to grow in number and stature[http://www.centcom.mil/CentcomNews/Stories/03_05/44.htmtarget=_blank]:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost 19,000 soldiers now serve in the Afghan National Army, with another 3,400 currently undergoing basic training. Permanent corps now stand in the four regions of Afghanistan-North (Mazar-e-Sharif), South (Kandahar), East (Gardez) and West (Herat)-and in Kabul. And plans for permanent brigade headquarters are also under way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Office of Military Cooperation--Afghanistan Deputy Director of the Defense Operations Sector British Lt. Col. Andy Fenton recently completed an operational assessment of the southern region, assessing the operations and conduct of these soldiers. By all accounts, the soldiers serve nobly, stand ready and ably carry out their duties. "The soldiers," said Fenton, "displayed a good standard of tactical skill and a high standard of situational awareness" on the operations I participated in. They drew their experience from either prior, pre-ANA combat experience or from their ANA service. "They knew the area well and seemed to anticipate potential trouble," he added. "And they acted proactively to situations, rather than reactively." To help build fully professional and modern armed forces, Afghanistan's first military academy is starting to graduate cadets[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Mar2005/20050321_267.htmltarget=_blank]:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Military Academy of Afghanistan graduated its first class of basic training soldiers March 17. The 112 cadets then swore into the academy in front of three ANA generals as well as Combined Joint Task Force Phoenix commander Army Brig. Gen. Richard Moorhead and Army Col. James Wilhite of the Office of Military Cooperation-Afghanistan, as well as representatives from the Iraqi Ministry of Defense and the Turkish force commander. . . .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The basic training course included physical fitness training, basic infantry tactics, weapons familiarization and qualification, military customs and courtesies, first aid, road marches and proper drill and ceremony. . . .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The newly formed academy is the first military academy for the Afghan National Army and is being structured around the same format used at the United States Military Academy at West Point, N.Y. With the completion of the officer candidate basic training, the cadets move on to four years of higher education at the academy. Upon completion of a four-year college degree, each cadet will then be a commissioned officer in the ANA. Here's another report[http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=topNews&amp;storyID=7970214target=_blank] on the opening of the academy. In related developments, the Afghan army has opened the 27th out of the planned total of 34 recruitment centers[http://feeds.bignewsnetwork.com/?sid=eef70512555c6da4target=_blank] (one for each of Afghanistan's provinces). This one is situated in the famous Panjshir Valley, which for decades has been a hotbed of resistance, first against the Soviet occupation and then against the Taliban. There are also improvements in the way Afghan troops are being trained and mentored[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Mar2005/20050321_265.htmltarget=_blank]:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the first time in the history of the Afghanistan National Army, an embedded training team [EET] will work with its unit from the first day of training. ANA soldiers are trained in kandaks, battalion-sized elements of 800 soldiers, then sent on missions throughout Afghanistan. The ETT, made up of coalition soldiers, mentors and trains the kandak in actual military operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until now, the members of an ETT met their kandak for the first time on graduation day at the Kabul Military Training Center. They would then transport the kandak members to their assigned duty station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ETTs now have the opportunity to build trust and bond with the ANA soldiers much earlier. More importantly, an ETT has a hand in its kandak's basic training, where in the past, training had to be conducted in the field after basic training.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. soldiers are helping their Afghan colleagues computerize their communication network[http://www.menafn.com/qn_news_story.asp?StoryId=CqKtSueidywzNAgfUAxn0yw4Ty29TBxvUAwmtarget=_blank]. "We are building a communications infrastructure starting from virtually nothing," says Air Force Capt. Robert Frees, a strategic computer network consultant for the U.S.-led Office of Military Cooperation in Afghanistan. As one report explains[http://www.centcom.mil/CentcomNews/Stories/03_05/43.htmtarget=_blank]:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through tremendous effort by OMC-A [Office of Military Cooperation--Afghanistan] and the Afghan MoD's Communications Directorate, computers and networks are being installed at the MoD, at all five corps headquarters and at all training facilities. OMC-A is carrying out a $31 million comprehensive plan for initial stand-up, intermediate automation and permanent sustainment of communications systems connecting all echelons of the ANA with their first-ever automated command and control systems. . . .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A large investment in human resources is also necessary. The base of knowledge and experience ANA soldiers have with computer technology is very limited. ANA Maj. Gen. Mohammad Amin Norestani, chief of legal affairs for the MoD, recognized the importance of computer technology early in the development of the new ANA...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next project in OMC-A's comprehensive plan is to set up eight computer labs at the Kabul Military Training Center so new recruits can learn about computers before they get to their first assignment. In a related[http://www.centcom.mil/CentcomNews/Stories/03_05/48.htmtarget=_blank], but somewhat less high-tech, development, "the Afghan National Army can now talk freely--from Kandahar, to Kabul, to Herat--thanks to recently received communication equipment that replaced Soviet-era radios and systems."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Afghan army has also received some valuable military aid from the Indian government[http://www.cfc-a.centcom.mil/default.asp?StoryID=143target=_blank]:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Balloons were tied to new trucks aligned in an L-shape, ready to be driven away. But salesmen weren't haggling with customers trying to make deals. Instead, the government of India turned over the keys to 50 four-and-a-half-ton trucks it donated to Afghanistan in a ceremony held at the Afghan National Army's 1st Brigade, 201st Corps, motor pool at the Presidential Palace in Kabul.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Throughout Afghanistan, the disarmament program is slowly coming to a successful conclusion:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Afghanistan has completed the cantonment of heavy weapons in the Panjshir valley[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-03/06/content_2657769.htmtarget=_blank], the former stronghold of late Afghan guerrilla commander Ahmad Shah Masoud and anti-Taliban fighters, a UN spokesman said here Sunday. "The collection of heavy weapons in the Panjshir valley is concluded on Friday with collection of 115 pieces in total," said spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva. . . .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over 200 pieces of heavy weapons have been held in the Shindand District, Herat province, and Kunduz province, which have been regarded as significant areas for storing heavy weapons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The program is now entering the final stage[http://www.southasianmedia.net/index_story.cfm?id=194233&amp;category=Frontend&amp;Country=AFGHANISTANtarget=_blank]:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gen. Zahir Azemi, a spokesman for the defense ministry, said that the DDR program had four phases and the third stage has been completed. The first phase, which was considered a pilot scheme, was confined to some provinces, the second and the third phases were fully implemented by the disarmament of militias throughout the country later.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Weak payroll growth and declining unemployment suggest that the U.S. job market is growing at a slow but steady pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employers added a disappointing 110,000 jobs in March, the fewest since July and a big decline from 243,000 in February, the Labor Department reported. Meanwhile, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell to 5.2% in March from 5.4% in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists believe that last month's lackluster performance in payroll growth is an indication of businesses turning more cautious in the face of profit pressures and another spike in energy prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Commerce Department reported that construction spending increased 0.4% in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.05 trillion. In addition, the Institute for Supply Management, which polls purchasing agents at more than 400 industrial companies, said its index of manufacturing activity was relatively unchanged at 55.2 in March. The new-orders index ticked higher to 57.1 from 55.8, while the employment gauge slipped to 53.3 from 57.4.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Index readings above 50 indicate the sector is expanding. The March number represents the 22nd consecutive month of manufacturing growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM also reported its nonmanufacturing index rose to 63.1 in March from 59.8 in the prior month. The employment gauge in this survey also slipped, to 57.1 from 59.6.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The ISM survey provides a picture of the manufacturing sector that is growing at a moderately strong rate and yet struggling to overcome higher commodity prices," said Daniel Meckstroth, chief economist at the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, a policy research group in Arlington, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But pressures on profits are holding down hiring, he added. The Labor Department's report said that manufacturing employment fell 8,000 in March and the factory head count is down 20,000 since December 2004. Job losses at factories and in the retail sector tempered gains in professional and business services, construction, education and health services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The low jobless rate may overstate the underlying strength in the labor market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were 7.7 million people unemployed in March, with an average duration of 19.5 weeks, the highest since November. The labor-force participation rate remained steady at only 65.8% for the month, the lowest level since 1988.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The participation rate, however, likely will improve if the economy continues to expand. "The slowdown in the labor force has been largely due to young people staying in school. This suggests labor-force growth will reaccelerate in the upcoming years as young people go to work," according to a report by ISI Group in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there is a silver lining to the lukewarm jobs report, it is that it could benefit consumers by keeping a lid on mortgage rates. "The report provides further evidence that labor markets are improving only very gradually, allowing the [Federal Reserve] to maintain its measured pace of tightening" interest rates, said Peter Kretzmer, senior economist at Bank of America Corp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The jobs report, for now, has eased worries that the Fed might boost short-term interest rates half a percentage point at its May 3 policy meeting. The fact that employment growth remains sluggish while economic growth is strong suggests that growth in output per worker -- productivity -- has picked up again after slowing late last year. Higher productivity helps companies keep a lid on costs and thus prices. Despite the fall in the unemployment rate, there is still no sign of accelerating wages. Even so, the Fed remains worried about inflation, and price reports will likely play a bigger role in its interest-rate decisions than job reports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the University of Michigan survey showed that inflation fears sent consumer confidence down to 92.6 in March from 94.1 a month earlier.</p>
