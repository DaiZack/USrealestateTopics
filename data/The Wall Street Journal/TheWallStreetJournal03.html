<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of real-estate speculation is slowing, a sign that the outlook in the U.S. housing market is darkening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small-time investors who flooded into real estate in the past decade to take advantage of low borrowing costs and rising home values are starting to cut back. The moves indicate that the market's short-term risk takers see limited upside -- and possible turbulence -- ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of new-home loans issued with terms of three years or less, typically used by investors looking to make a quick profit, dropped 11% in the July-to-September period from a year earlier. It was the smallest amount since the second quarter of 2015, according to Attom Data Solutions, a real-estate data firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher interest rates have put a damper on the U.S. housing market, a building block of an otherwise solid economy. Housing long provided a boost as the U.S. rebounded from the latest real-estate bubble, but in recent months it has threatened to turn to a drag.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of real-estate speculation is slowing, a sign of the darkening outlook in the U.S. housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small-time investors who flooded into real estate in the past decade to take advantage of low borrowing costs and rising home values are starting to cut back. The moves indicate that the market's short-term risk-takers see limited upside—and possible turbulence—ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of new home loans issued with terms of three years or less, typically used by investors looking to make a quick profit, dropped by 11% in the July-to-September period from a year earlier. It was the smallest amount since the second quarter of 2015, according to Attom Data Solutions, a real-estate data firm.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the current cycle, investors have found it profitable to buy properties and quickly fix them up to resell or rent.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A semiprofessional borrower might have a full-time job and do this part-time," said Matthew Neisser, chief operating officer at LendingOne LLC, which lends directly to such investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regional and national direct lenders have popped up to provide short-term loans to investors, helping individuals access the cash that a regular mortgage broker typically wouldn't provide.

</div><div class="author">By Melissa Korn </div><div>684 words</div><div>8 December 2018</div><div>07:00</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2018 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Stanford University</span> is making changes in how it calculates undergraduate students' financial aid[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/how-to-get-the-most-financial-aid-for-college-1536545221] to exclude the value of home equity, acknowledging that many families may be house rich but cash poor and see college as out of reach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move, in which Stanford joins <span class="companylink">Harvard University</span> and the <span class="companylink">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span>, will benefit families who live in parts of the country with high home prices[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/home-price-gains-continue-to-slow-in-september-1543327892]. Not all schools take home values into their financial aid assessments, but for those that do it can change packages dramatically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Silicon Valley, Seattle, Denver and Dallas, median home values</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
have risen by roughly 30% to 70% since the peak[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/the-u-s-housing-boom-is-coming-to-an-end-starting-in-dallas-1543248073] of the last housing boom more than a decade ago, meaning students from relatively modest backgrounds may now live in homes that would price them out of many grant offers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stanford doesn't have to dangle many deals to attract students. The university admitted just 4.4% of applicants for the current first-year class, but officials there say they want to make sure they're not scaring anyone off because of price. Starting this year, the school won't report its application figures[https://news.stanford.edu/2018/08/30/stanford-will-no-longer-announce-undergraduate-application-numbers/].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Previously, Stanford considered home equity up to 1.2 times income, for most families earning more than $150,000. For example, a family living in a house valued at $1 million and earning $250,000 would have no more than $300,000 in home equity count toward their assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Schools expect families to put anywhere between 2% and 12% of parental assets toward college costs, financial aid experts say. At 5%, a common figure, a $300,000 asset could add $15,000 to the family's projected annual tab.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Families that feel particularly pinched are families in that $100,000 to $150,000 range that live in higher-cost parts of the country," said Nick Ducoff, co-founder of Edmit, a website that predicts aid packages and provides advice on the value of different colleges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said nonprofits that award scholarships "aren't playing tiny violins for those families," and the idea of being on the hook for $50,000 a year or more for college can seem insurmountable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For lower-income families, Stanford already doesn't expect parents to chip in anything if they earn less than $65,000, and it covers parental contributions for tuition when income is below $125,000. Harvard and a handful of other elite colleges have similar thresholds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or Fafsa, form doesn't count primary-residence home equity when assessing aid packages, and some schools rely just on that calculation. The form does request information on rental properties and vacation homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two hundred and fifty-four schools also ask aid applicants to complete the College Board's CSS Profile, which they use to allocate institutional grants[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/prizes-for-everyone-how-colleges-use-scholarships-to-lure-students-1523957400] and does have a question about primary-residence equity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MIT hadn't considered home equity for families earning less than $100,000 for years. It raised the cap to $150,000 in 2014, then eliminated it entirely in 2016. Harvard also doesn't look at home equity on a primary residence. Yale caps home equity at three times a family's total income, and Brown also takes it into account.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some schools, like <span class="companylink">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</span> in Troy, N.Y., consider 100% of the equity in an undergraduate applicant's primary residence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Occidental College in Los Angeles is in the third year of a pilot program that eliminates home equity—up to $1 million—from aid considerations for California applicants whose families earn between roughly $125,000 and $180,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's something that was coming up as a concern over and over again for a lot of our families," said financial aid director Gina Becerril, with middle-class families not qualifying for aid but not actually able to afford sticker price.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales for high-end home builder Toll Brothers Inc. were weaker during the latest quarter, and the company declined to offer guidance for the full year ahead, in another sign of uncertainty in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The value of Toll contracts for new homes signed declined by 15% in the quarter that ended in October. Rising home prices, higher mortgage rates and fewer foreign buyers cut into sales, the company said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The high-price California market, where the number of Toll contracts signed was down nearly 40% in the quarter, was the biggest factor in the slowdown of its home sales. <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span>' share price initially declined about 3% on the news Tuesday along with a decline in the equities market but recovered and ended down 1.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Despite a healthy economy we [are] seeing a moderation in demand," Toll Brothers Chief Executive Doug Yearley said on a Tuesday call with analysts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span>' results in the quarter ended in June were a bright spot amid a slowing housing market, as its slice of affluent consumers who tend to put more cash down on purchases seemed initially resilient to rising housing costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the market slowed further and the company uncharacteristically didn't provide guidance for the coming year, instead offering guidance only for the first quarter. Executives said it is difficult to predict how long the current housing slowdown will last and how other factors, such as tariffs, could affect material prices. November, the first quarter of the company's 2019 fiscal year, showed further softening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These current market conditions create a range of possible scenarios for our full-year results," Chief Financial Officer Martin Connor said on the call.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders' stocks have been beaten up this year. The share price for <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> and <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span> are both down more than 30% year to date.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The number of U.S. existing homes going under contract declined in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> on Thursday said its pending home sales index, which tracks contract signings for purchases of previously owned homes, dropped 2.6% from the prior month to 102.1 in October. Sales, unless they fall through, typically close within a month or two of signing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a 0.3% gain in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index was down 6.7% in October from a year earlier, marking the 10th straight month of annual decreases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The recent rise in mortgage rates have reduced the pool of eligible home buyers," said Lawrence Yun, the trade group's chief economist. "However, mortgage rates are much lower today compared to earlier this century. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More widely, housing-market inventory has been tight, driving up home prices and pricing some potential buyers out of the market. At the same time, skilled-construction-labor shortages, higher input costs and rising mortgage rates are also making the overall cost of buying a home more expensive. Sales of previously owned U.S. homes posted their largest annual decline since 2014 in October.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Adam Bonislawski </div><div>512 words</div><div>30 November 2018</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2018 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to home values, it's good to live close to a highway -- but not too close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's the finding of a 2016 study in the journal Transportation that used housing data from the Dutch Land Registry that looked at sales prices of 269,000 homes before and after the 2004 completion of two large highways in the eastern Netherlands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers found that highway construction has a "generally positive" effect on area housing prices. However, that effect varies depending on a home's precise location. Improved accessibility raised home values, but for properties right by the new road this effect was counteracted by increases in noise and traffic density.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the positive effects were spread across tens of thousands of home, while the negative effects were concentrated among several hundred homes, "the net effect [of the new highways] was overwhelmingly positive," said Or Levkovich, a postdoctoral fellow in spatial economics at <span class="companylink">Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam</span>. He and the other researchers found that the highway developments boosted home prices by roughly 5% in the run-up to their opening and by 2.5% to 4.3% in the years following their completion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those increases, however, were driven entirely by housing near one of the two highways, the A50. Houses near the other highway, the A30, actually lost value in the run-up to completion (4%) and showed no increase in value following completion. Dr. Levkovich and his colleagues suggest that this is likely due to the fact that homes along the A30 experienced only a slight increase in accessibility, as many were already located near major roads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results track with those from a 2015 study published by researchers at <span class="companylink">Florida Gulf Coast University</span> and appraisal firm American Valuation in the Journal of Sustainable Real Estate that found a similar balance between noise and accessibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In that paper, the researchers used a spatial regression to look at 1,025 single-family homes in 19 suburban Florida neighborhoods located along existing highways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They found that sales prices were 4% lower for homes directly adjacent to the highway compared with homes not directly adjacent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, prices dropped 2.5% with each additional mile of driving distance between a house and the nearest highway on-ramp, indicating that, as with the Dutch study, proximity to transportation is desirable.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When actor Brian Kerwin decided to sell his longtime Manhattan home—an 1880s Romanesque townhouse he and his late wife had carefully restored—he was hoping it would go for about $12 million, based on similar sales in the neighborhood. When he and his agent, Kim Mogul Wright of <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</span>, agreed on a price tag of $8.5 million, he thought there would be "five takers within a week," said Mr. Kerwin, 69, who has appeared in movies such as "The Help" and "27 Dresses."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So he was shocked when the Upper West Side listing got "absolutely zero interest." Finally, after a year on the market and several price cuts, the redbrick house is now in contract for about $5.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Accepting that the home would sell for far less than he had imagined was a gradual—and emotional—process, said Mr. Kerwin, who bought the house for less than $1 million in the early 1990s and raised his children there. "It's like hitchhiking; after standing there for 10 hours you'll take anything," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kerwin is one of many Manhattan homeowners struggling to accept the new reality of the New York City real-estate market, as prices slide after a decadelong boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year has brought into sharp focus all the pressures on the market. The slowdown began at the time of a stock market rally and record-low New York City unemployment—factors that typically accompany strong real-estate sales in the city. For that reason, many owners are reluctant to accept lower prices, even as buyers determinedly seek bargains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York is facing the convergence of several large economic forces: an oversupply of new condos, a drop in international buyers as some countries impose capital controls, changes to the tax law that cap state and local deductions[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/the-hamptons-home-market-falters-1543505357], and rising interest rates. There is also a shift in taste from uptown to downtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Lee J. Stahl of the design/build firm the Renovated Home put it: "It's a crazy Bermuda Triangle of forces that have lined up against people trying to sell and buy these properties." The Upper East Side luxury co-op market in particular is "a train wreck," said Mr. Stahl, who often works with agents listing properties in need of renovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, for example, financier Ramesh Singh sold his sprawling Park Avenue duplex for $13.75 million—far less than the $20.365 million he paid in 2008, according to public records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's a far different scenario from 2016, when New York City real-estate prices climbed to new heights as moneyed buyers from all over the world stashed cash in ultraluxury megatowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just two years ago, "the units sold themselves," said agent Ann Cutbill Lenane of <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</span>. "We were like Vanna White pointing at the letters and they magically turned over."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the third quarter of this year, the overall number of Manhattan home sales dropped 11%, according to a report from <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>. Some sellers of Manhattan apartments have taken losses of up to 30% or more from what they originally paid for them at various points in time, according to a data analysis for The Wall Street Journal by the real-estate listings website StreetEasy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other boldface names who lost money on recent deals include U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who last year sold his four-bedroom Midtown Manhattan penthouse—with a dining room that comfortably seats 30—for $15.95 million, down from the $18 million he paid for it in 2007, according to public records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards sold his Greenwich Village penthouse this fall for $9 million, four years after buying it for $10.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One factor is the dramatic oversupply of high-price, new construction condos. Some 1,775 new Manhattan condos are forecast to hit the market by the end of 2018, according to Corcoran Sunshine; in 2011, there were 277. Of the active condo listings on the market, nearly 800 are listed for $5 million or more, up 61% from 462 in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan condo builders paid record prices for land and built increasingly tall towers, leaving the city with a huge pool of expensive supply. "People started doing these developments with pricing expectations that were insane," said New York developer Ian Bruce Eichner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now many of those developers are cutting prices and offering incentives such as paying buyers' transfer taxes, says Stephen Kliegerman, president of Halstead Development Marketing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agent Tal Alexander of <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> said he also sees agents promise sellers unrealistic prices to secure listing exclusives, so properties linger on the market for years and undergo price cuts. "It leads buyers to believe that the market is weaker than it actually is," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
John Iacono, co-president of New Jersey-based car dealership Bram Auto Group, said that when he and his wife listed the Financial District condo they bought in 2009, they encountered stiff competition from new developments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New buildings "are now very negotiable," Mr. Iacono said, and buyers are "not afraid of asking for a reduction in price."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple switched real-estate agents and cut the price, and finally, in October, they sold the apartment for $2.32 million, compared with the $2.97 million they paid in 2009. Mr. Iacono said he preferred to cut his losses and move on rather than wait for the market to rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If it comes back, how many years is it going to take?" he said. "Am I willing to gamble? It's not worth it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But agents said the slowdown extends beyond new condos, hitting every segment of the market. While the cooling is more significant at the high-end, smaller units also are affected. In the third quarter, the median price for a one-bedroom Manhattan home was $815,000, down 4% from the same period in 2017. The volume of sales fell 12.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What's most significant about 2018 is that even the sub-$1 million market is slowing because of rising mortgage rates," said appraiser Jonathan Miller. Rates for a 30-year mortgage averaged 4.81% in late November, up nearly a full percentage point from the beginning of the year, according to <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Takk Yamaguchi, an agent at Compass, said he has been sitting for hours at Sunday open houses at his sub-$1 million listings across the city, waiting for buyers who never show up. "Last year, there would have been a bus load of people waiting for me to arrive," he said. "Now, it's just me and a bunch of brokers standing around."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some agents predicted there would be an oversupply of luxury condos after the building boom. Many new towers were built for the ultrawealthy, with few options for middle-class New Yorkers or first-time home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop in international buyers shopping for Manhattan homes is another reason the market has slowed. Kelly Kennedy Mack, president of Corcoran Sunshine, said the number of international buyers has fallen roughly 10% in buildings the company represents. She attributed the decline in part to tighter capital controls overseas, which have made it hard for some to buy in the U.S. The Chinese government, for example, has been cracking down on individuals making overseas investments—tightening restrictions that curb capital outflows and making it harder for its citizens to move large sums of money to the U.S. for real-estate purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When the market was really robust and there were all these deals above $20 million, everybody jumped into that pond," said Pam Liebman, CEO of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, about developers' rush to build expensive units. "They forget that absorption of these units, even though it was at its highest levels in history, is still not hundreds of units a year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Digital-media entrepreneur Javier Saralegui and his wife, Angela Bedoya, recently slashed the price of their Upper East Side townhouse to $11.995 million, the latest in a long series of price cuts since they first listed it for $19.995 million in October 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We know that it's a gorgeous townhouse, but there's a certain point where you have to just leave your ego at the door and accept that the market has changed," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, there are now more than 100 Manhattan homes actively listed at more than $20 million, and those are selling at a rate of only about four a month, Ms. Liebman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industry insiders also blame the 2017 tax-reform package that limits deductions on federal returns for state and local taxes. In high-tax states like New York, the result is significantly higher tax bills for some residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That change in the tax law really infected the real-estate bloodstream in New York," said Manhattan real-estate agent Donna Olshan. Many of her clients pay six or seven figures in city and state tax bills each year and can no longer deduct the lion's share, she said. That has pushed some buyers to move to lower-tax states, she said, or to reduce their purchase budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other buyers are simply unsure what their tax bills will be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At the moment, it's like this fear," said Hall Willkie, president of Brown Harris Stevens. "And it's another reason to delay a decision if you can."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the tax changes were announced, Allegra and Morgan Eifler were in the midst of looking for a larger apartment near their prewar one-bedroom co-op in Yorkville on the Upper East Side. Ms. Eifler, a 33-year-old interior designer, said the young couple was "really worried" about how the changes would affect them. For that and other reasons, they took their time with their home search. When a two-bedroom unit in their building came on the market, they made an offer well below the $1.975 million asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We went in with what we truly believed it was worth," said Mr. Eifler, 31, who works in finance, noting that the unit needed work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When they didn't get a counteroffer, they continued with their search and were surprised when, four months later, the listing agent called to say their offer had been accepted. They closed, paying $1.55 million, and plan to start renovating soon. Meanwhile, they have listed their one-bedroom for $739,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Eifler said the experience of buying in this climate was far different from when he purchased his first apartment in 2013. Back then, "everybody was like 'You have to make an offer that day or you'll lose it,' " he recalled. "Whereas now you don't feel the pressure to pull the trigger."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate advice is increasingly in demand. When agent Jason Haber of <span class="companylink">Warburg Realty</span> mentioned his profession at a recent Columbus Circle cocktail party, he was "accosted" by fellow guests demanding to know whether they should buy now and lamenting that they hadn't sold a year ago. "I felt like I was in the White House briefing room," Mr. Haber said, who said he spent so much time fielding questions, he hardly got to touch his pan-roasted chicken and broccoli rabe, and had to grab a slice of pizza on the way home. "Next time I'll tell them I'm a juggler, maybe they'll leave me alone," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan homeowner Laurence Strubing, 73, a retired executive, has been trying to sell his Upper East Side co-op for a year. Initially listed at $2.65 million, it is now priced at $1.8 million—less than he paid for it. "You never think about real estate as depreciating," Mr. Strubing said. "The thought is that it always appreciates in value, especially in New York."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Strubing and his wife, Kathryn, live primarily in Connecticut but bought the two-bedroom, Upper East Side pied-à-terre for $1.9 million in 2014. The couple liked its location close to museums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They enjoyed the apartment, staying overnight after trips to the <span class="companylink">Metropolitan Museum of Art</span> or evenings at the theater. But recently they bought a beach house in the Hamptons and decided to sell the Manhattan apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They and their agent, Ellen Devens of Brown Harris Stevens, were surprised when it sat and sat on the market despite multiple price drops. Buyers seem deterred by things that were never an issue in the past, like the fact that the laundry is located in the basement rather than in the apartment itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, experts don't expect this downturn to be as severe as the one in 2008, because banks have continued lending and buyers still want to purchase homes in New York City—as long as they feel they're getting a good deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Pretty much everything sells" eventually, said Mr. Eichner, adding that he has been negotiable on prices at his building on Madison Square Park. "The question is how long does it take and how much discount do you have to give."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other parts of New York City, such as Queens, might see a boost from the announcement that <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> is opening a new headquarters in Long Island City. However, insiders say the move is unlikely to be a major factor for the Manhattan luxury market, especially because the average wage of the jobs created from the move will be $150,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hedge-fund billionaire and <span class="companylink">Milwaukee Bucks</span> co-owner Marc Lasry recently sold his Beaux-Arts townhouse on the Upper East Side for $31.95 million, after putting it on the market last year for $39 million. He said he didn't mind the reduced price. He bought the house for $11 million in 2001. He and his wife had moved into a new apartment and simply wanted this property off their hands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is what it is," Mr. Lasry said. "If the market was $50 million for it, great. If it was $30 million, that's fine too."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Uptown vs. downtown: Changing Tastes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real-estate slowdown affects all areas of Manhattan, but high-end homes on the Upper East Side and Upper West Side have been particularly hard hit, agents said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Uptown is not considered hip right now," said Manhattan real-estate agent Royce Pinkwater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past five years, she said, wealthy buyers have increasingly gravitated away from the famed prewar co-ops of Park Avenue and Central Park West—New York's traditional bastions of the moneyed classes—and moved to Lower Manhattan neighborhoods, such as Tribeca and Chelsea, closer to nightlife.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They think it's cooler to live downtown," said Ms. Pinkwater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many Uptown buildings also have strict co-op boards, which complicates matters in a soft market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Park Avenue has definitely suffered," said Corcoran CEO Pamela Liebman. "There are a lot of other choices out there."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A case in point: After buying a $33.6 million penthouse at the new West Chelsea condo tower 551 West 21st Street, <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> partner Armen Avanessians and his wife, Janette, listed their apartment at the El Dorado, the twin-spired prewar apartment overlooking Central Park. They had bought it from the actor Bruce Willis in 2015 for $12.75 million, but ended up selling it for $9.9 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lucky buyer who scooped up the discounted apartment? Mary Solomon, the wife of new Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, according to public records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Avanessianses also took a loss on another El Dorado unit they owned, selling it for $3.85 million in May of 2017, two years after buying it for $6.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Candace Taylor</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luxury Supply Is Still Growing as Sales Cool</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• So far this year, more than 50 Manhattan owners have sold their properties for less than they paid, according to StreetEasy. The biggest loss recorded was $6.61 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• There were more than 100 Manhattan homes listed for $20 million or higher at the end of the third quarter, according to <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>. On average, these homes sell at a rate of fewer than four a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Some 1,775 new Manhattan condos are forecast to hit the market by the year end, said Corcoran Sunshine; in 2011, there were 277. Of the active condo listings already on the market, nearly 800 are listed for $5 million or more, up 61% from 462 in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• By the end of the third quarter, Manhattan apartment inventory rose 15% year-to-year, to 12,186, according to Corcoran Sunshine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• By the third-quarter end, there were 992 Manhattan condo and co-op listings above $5 million, up 48% from the 2013 quarter, according to Corcoran Sunshine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• The median sales price for a Manhattan home was $1.117 million in the third quarter, down 4.5% from the 2017 period. The median price of a new condo unit fell 9% to $2.55 million, according to Miller Samuel.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slid 8.9% in October</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new U.S. homes slid sharply in October as higher mortgage rates and rising construction costs created significant headwinds for home builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of newly built single-family homes fell 8.9% from September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 544,000 in October, the Commerce Department said. From a year earlier, sales were down 12%. The 8.9% decline was the steepest since December 2017 and marks the fifth month of declines this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While new-home sales represent a small segment of the overall housing market, they are an important one because they help drive economic growth through construction work as well as sales of furniture and appliances.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Sales of new U.S. homes slid sharply in October as higher mortgage rates  [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/mortgage-rates-fast-approaching-5-a-fresh-blow-to-housing-market-1539266400]and rising construction costs  [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/apartment-developers-are-slowing-construction-that-could-mean-higher-rents-1542110408]created significant headwinds for home builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of newly built single-family homes fell 8.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 544,000 in October, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. From a year earlier, U.S. sales in October were down 12%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 8.9% decline was the steepest since December last year and marked the fifth month of declines this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While new-home sales represent a small segment of the overall housing market, they are important because they help drive economic growth through construction work, as well as sales of furniture and appliances. The lackluster new-home sales performance also underscores that the housing slowdown affects more than one segment of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Dietz, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders, said Wednesday buyers are pulling back sharply as mortgage rates rise. The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in October was 4.83%, up from 4.03% in January, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market reacted more negatively than I expected." Mr. Dietz said. "Buyers really did react with a lot of caution."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other factors have also slowed sales. Builders face higher material and labor prices, which they are trying to pass along to consumers in the form of higher home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The math is growing difficult as home buyers are already squeezed by higher rates. "There's not a lot of room to maneuver," Mr. Dietz said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A tax law that passed nearly a year ago decreased the financial incentives  [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/new-tax-laws-have-home-buyers-checking-new-places-1528295467]for homeownership, especially for pricier homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowdown in sales has been widespread across the country [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/the-u-s-housing-boom-is-coming-to-an-end-starting-in-dallas-1543248073?mod=trending_now_2], suggesting that the tax bill isn't the primary culprit. Sales fell in all four regions of the country in October compared with the prior month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The months supply of homes on the market rose to 7.4 in October, the largest supply figure since February 2011. Mr. Dietz said about 40% of home builders are now offering price cuts, up from about one-quarter a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes rose 1.4% in October from the previous month although they fell on an annual basis, signaling continued weakness in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Almost all the trends in the U.S. housing market have been negative in recent months as housing market activity continues to adjust to higher mortgage rates," Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's chief economist, said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dietz said that if current trends continue, new-home sales are likely to be flat this year compared with last year, a disappointing result because many economists had hoped this would be a strong year for the new-home market given pent-up demand and years of limited supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As we close in on the end of 2018, it is abundantly clear with the benefit of hindsight that the new-home sales market took a turn this year, and not for the better," said Aaron Terrazas, a senior economist at Zillow, a real-estate database company.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price gains slowed in September for the sixth consecutive month, another sign that rising mortgage rates are helping sap the momentum out of the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which measures average home prices in major metropolitan areas across the nation, rose 5.5% in the year ended in September, down from the 5.7% year-over-year increase reported for August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price gains accelerated for most of the past two years, growing significantly faster than both incomes and inflation. But in recent months price growth has been steadily slowing as interest rates have risen and inventory in some markets has been growing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is absolutely a cooling market," said Ralph McLaughlin, deputy chief economist at CoreLogic Inc., a housing-data firm. "Interest rates have increased and that's really tamped down demand."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slowing home-price growth isn't universally bad news. For buyers, a slowdown in price gains will come as welcome relief, potentially giving wages an opportunity to catch up if the economy remains strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I really see this as a market coming into balance, rather than a market that's on the brink of a collapse," Mr. McLaughlin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller 10-city index gained 4.8% over the year, down from 5.2% the prior month. The 20-city index gained 5.1%, down from 5.5% the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas had the fastest home-price growth in the country for the fourth straight month, at 13.5%. It was followed by San Francisco, where prices grew 9.9% and Seattle with an 8.4% annual increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just four out of 20 cities reported greater annual increases in September than in August. The few places that are seeing price growth accelerate are ones that had some of the biggest gains and largest losses during the last housing cycle, including Las Vegas, Phoenix and Tampa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than five years of rapidly rising prices, combined with higher mortgage rates, are making homes increasingly unaffordable for buyers. Rates for a 30-year mortgage averaged 4.81% last week, up nearly a full percentage point from the beginning of the year, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most sectors of the housing market are slowing, including new-home sales and housing starts. Existing-home sales posted their largest annual decline since 2014 in October, but did rebound somewhat compared with a month earlier, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said last week. Lawrence Yun, the group's chief economist, said sales seem unlikely to rebound in the short term.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PLANO, Texas -- A half-hour drive straight north from downtown Dallas sits one of the fastest-growing counties in the country. Cotton fields have been replaced with Toyota's new North American headquarters, a <span class="companylink">Dallas Cowboys</span> training facility and a sand-colored shopping strip with a Tesla dealership and a three-story food hall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet even with the booming growth, Dallas's once vibrant housing market is sputtering. In the high-end subdivisions in the suburb of Frisco, builders are cutting prices on new homes by up to $150,000. On one street alone, $4 million of new homes sat empty earlier this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some home builders are so desperate to attract interest they are offering agents the chance to win <span class="companylink">Louis Vuitton</span> handbags or Super Bowl tickets with round-trip airfare, if their clients buy a home. Fresh-baked cookies sit uneaten at sparsely attended open houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. economy just had one of its best six-month stretches in a decade, as the unemployment rate hovers around its lowest level in half a century. Still, along with a recent swoon in the stock market, the housing market -- which makes up a sixth of the U.S. economy -- has been a troubling weak spot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. existing home sales have declined on an annual basis for eight straight months, the longest slump in more than four years, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. The slowdown has been driven by places that had earlier seen some of the strongest price growth during this recovery, including Seattle, Denver, New York, Boston and the Bay Area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dallas, which had the second-strongest annual increase in employment of any metropolitan area in the country in September, helps explain why. Even though the economy in the sprawling metro area has boomed, home prices have grown much faster than wages, and buyers have been straining to afford homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those price challenges have been masked in part by cheap credit, but that era is coming to an end. Since the beginning of the year, mortgage rates have risen about a percentage point, to the highest level since 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have this huge affordability crisis," said Ted Wilson, principal at Residential Strategies, a Dallas consulting firm. "With mortgage rates going higher, we're hitting a ceiling."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New and existing home sales in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area fell 3.6% in October compared with a year earlier, according to the Real Estate Center at <span class="companylink">Texas A&amp;M University</span>, while median home price growth slowed to less than half the pace of a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dallas has been the "canary in the mine shaft" this housing cycle, said Paige Shipp, regional director for Metrostudy, a consultant to home builders. Homes are taking longer to sell, bidding wars are rarer and price cuts are more common as buyers absorb the impact of higher rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cleave Treanor, a 29-year-old project manager, and his wife, Rebecca, decided at the beginning of the year it was time to move out of their 1,500-square-foot house. Their home had appreciated about 40% since they bought it four years ago, and they were tired of stepping on their two children's toys from a lack of space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They toured several dozen houses priced in the low $300,000s, but they once got a call that a house they had looked at sold that night for more than the asking price. Mr. Treanor recalled the housing market "felt extremely hot."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple decided in early March to buy a 2,800-square-foot newly built home. By the time they had made some repairs on their old house and put it up for sale in May, average 30-year mortgage rates had already risen to about 4.6% from 3.95% at the beginning of the year, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. "The market had died down," Mr. Treanor said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house sat for months before they dropped the price by $16,000. "It was a mess," Ms. Treanor said. The home finally sold in mid-October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates are closely tied to yields on 10-year Treasury notes, which have been going up this year because of growing inflation fears.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Some [buyers] are adjusting their budget. They're shopping more for different mortgage companies," said Amy Downs, an agent at <span class="companylink">Keller Williams Realty</span>. "They still think they can find a lender that can get them a better rate, but it doesn't really exist."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dallas is one of the markets where affordability has gotten furthest out of whack with historic norms. The metro area largely avoided the last housing boom, with home values from 1997 through 2006 rising a moderate 2.5% a year on average, according to Zillow. Builders would joke that they were "building for practice" in Dallas because margins were so thin, Ms. Shipp said. Since they were less inflated, home values in the Dallas area fell less than 10% during the last housing crash, compared with 26% for the U.S. as a whole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But prices have shot up in the past five years, to $235,500 for the median home, more than 50% above their 2007 peak and in line with increases in places like San Francisco and Seattle, according to Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A shortage of land and labor, along with the loss of many smaller, regional builders during the downturn led to more constricted supply. At the same time, the local economy boomed, and the Dallas metro saw a wave of companies relocating from California and other more expensive states. The metropolitan area has added roughly 100,000 jobs a year over the past five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dallas market is more sensitive to fluctuations in mortgage rates than other hot locations around the country. While cash buyers and large down payments have been king in the booming West Coast markets, the average household in Dallas finances 83% of its home purchase, slightly higher than the national average of 81%, according to <span class="companylink">Black Knight Inc</span>., a mortgage data company. In San Francisco and Seattle, buyers on average finance 74% and 79% respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As mortgage rates rise, buyers increasingly look for less-expensive homes. That is pushing builders further out to the fringes in search of lower-cost land where they can try to build more homes priced at $300,000 or less. The median price for a new home in Dallas has dropped by some $3,000 this year compared with last year, according to Metrostudy, which suggests builders are building at lower price points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That can be a risky strategy after the heat has already started to come out of the market. During the last downturn, it was precisely those exurban neighborhoods that got hit the earliest and the hardest as buyers migrated back to more desirable neighborhoods when prices fell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Altura Homes' new Eagle Ridge development sits half-an-hour east of downtown Dallas, where strip malls give way to grassy fields and rusting farm equipment. The cheapest home, a 1,700-square-foot three-bedroom, starts around $240,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The model home features few frills: no pool, no bathroom for each bedroom, no flashy off-site design studio to see decorating options, just some swatches and flooring samples in the garage of a model home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales have been slow here, too, in recent months. Altura is offering to put money in at closing to help buyers lower their monthly payments. The rise in mortgage rates "has scared some people away," said Kelly Hoodwin, vice president of sales and marketing at Altura Homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Donnie Evans, the company's division president, said he wants to try to build even less-expensive homes. He believes there is demand for homes priced less than $250,000 but said rising land, labor and material costs make that difficult. Buyers, accustomed to living in amenity-rich apartment buildings, also seem less willing to accept a no-frills option than they once were. "If we could get [prices] lower we could sell more houses," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agents say it is becoming tougher to persuade buyers to move and give up their sub-4% mortgage rates -- which they fear they won't see again. That combined with how much they would have to spend to trade up because of how much prices have risen in recent years has persuaded more people to simply stay put and renovate.</p>

Buyers, accustomed to living in amenity-rich apartment buildings[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/big-jump-in-americans-saying-renting-is-cheaper-than-owning-1539705295], also seem less willing to accept a no-frills option than they once were. "If we could get [prices] lower we could sell more houses," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast, supply is tight in the small slice of the market where homes are still priced below $200,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agents say it is becoming tougher to persuade buyers to move and give up their sub-4% mortgage rates—which they fear they won't see again. That combined with how much they would have to spend to trade up because of how much prices have risen in recent years has persuaded more people to simply stay put and renovate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, buyers are enjoying having the upper hand. Doyle and Janice Eiler, a retired couple from Oklahoma City, recently purchased a new home in the northern Dallas suburbs. When Ms. Eiler walked into the home for the first time she started crying: The kitchen had far too little cupboard space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Eilers' real-estate agent, Connie Durnal at Redfin, went to the home builder and demanded the company add additional cupboards without charge or the buyers might walk away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company agreed. "A year ago they wouldn't have done that," Ms. Durnal said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 80% of borrowers who refinanced mortgages in the third quarter chose the "cash out" option, the highest share since 2007. Business &amp; Finance headlines on Nov. 26 with an article about cash-out refis incorrectly said they reached a record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(WSJ December 20, 2018)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising mortgage rates are crushing much of the refinancing market. But Americans are still using refis to pull cash out of their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 80% of borrowers who refinanced in the third quarter chose the "cash out" option, withdrawing $14.6 billion in equity out of their homes, according to government-sponsored mortgage corporation <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. That is the highest share of cash-out refis since 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend attests to the current state of the U.S. economy, which is more than nine years into an expansion that has lifted home values sharply but raised workers' pay at a much slower pace. Now many are finding their homes to be a tappable source of wealth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home equity is the big pot of gold," said Sam Khater, chief economist at Freddie Mac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase is also a reminder of how rising mortgage rates are roiling the market. Higher rates, which make buying a home more expensive, are slowing home sales. Rate-based refinancings, where homeowners get a lower rate on their mortgages, are also drying up, which has caused the higher proportion of cash-out refis. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is 4.81%, according to data released Wednesday by <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, up from 3.99% at the end of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a cash-out refi, a homeowner essentially trades in a mortgage for a new one with a larger principal balance. The borrower can then pay off the old mortgage and still pocket a chunk of cash. Lenders say that homeowners often use the cash for home renovations or to pay down other debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mandy Whitworth of Dallas completed a cash-out refi a few months ago. She said she is happy that the roughly $75,000 in cash will let her pay for a home addition and pay off a credit card, even though she had to trade in a mortgage with a 3.625% interest rate for one with a 5.75% rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For me, I don't have that much cash on hand," she said. "It allowed me to pull out equity from the home to reinvest in the repairs and addition."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash-out refis played a big role in the decade-ago housing crisis, when many homeowners used their properties as ATMs just before home prices plunged. But the amount of cash that homeowners are extracting now is far below precrisis levels, a sign that borrowers and lenders are more cautious this time around. In 2006, there were three straight quarters during which borrowers withdrew more than $80 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Summer Garrett, a mortgage-loan originator at <span class="companylink">Homebridge Financial Services Inc</span>. in Dallas, said borrowers are showing more interest in cash-out refis as home prices continue to rise in the area, even though interest rates also are rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Even with that higher interest rate, it is still less expensive than other avenues," she said. The average rate on a credit card is nearly 18%, according to Bankrate.com, a personal-finance website.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some industry watchers worry that the products could be marketed to homeowners who don't understand them by lenders anxious to keep up loan volume in a cooling housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are issuers that really want to make their profitability targets," said Michael Bright, chief operating officer of government-owned mortgage corporation Ginnie Mae. "The only way to do it is to convince borrowers to take cash out of their house."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A homeowner who uses money from a cash-out refi to pay down other, higher-rate debt could still end up paying more in the long run. A borrower who trades in a 4% mortgage for a 5% mortgage might be able to pay off credit-card debt but could end up paying thousands of dollars more in interest over the life of the mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowers who swap credit-card debt for mortgage debt are essentially trading unsecured debt for secured debt, where the repercussions for missing payments are much steeper. Borrowers who miss mortgage payments can end up in foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, if home prices fall, homeowners can wind up owing more than their homes are worth, which happened to many borrowers in the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bright said <span class="companylink">Ginnie Mae</span> is "preparing to take additional steps" to ensure "that borrowers aren't being solicited for refinancings that don't make sense."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ian Young, a cybersecurity architect who lives in Huntsville, Ala., did a cash-out refi in 2016, pulling $50,000 out of his home to cover the cost of renovations and pay down student loans. Since then, he has incurred more debt from pursuing another degree. But even though the value of his house has increased, he decided against another cash-out refi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I would rather keep the mortgage low enough that I could still sell the house and move," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, some borrowers find cash-out refis attractive. Jameson Wildwood, a software engineer in North Carolina, did a cash-out refi over the summer on an investment property he owns in Sacramento, Calif. He used the approximately $31,000 he pocketed to make another real-estate investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think the market, especially in California and other areas, has increased a lot, so there's a lot of equity that active investors can use to make more investments," he said. "For me, it was a great way of putting those funds to work."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sarah Chaney </div><div>379 words</div><div>25 November 2018</div><div>15:00</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2018 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. will see the second reading of third-quarter economic growth, October new-home sales data and personal-income figures. China will release data on factory activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WEDNESDAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department releases its second estimate of third-quarter gross domestic product[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-economic-growth-slated-to-cool-in-third-quarter-1538065930]. In its original report, the agency estimated GDP—the value of all goods and services produced in the U.S.—rose at a seasonally and inflation-adjusted annual rate of 3.5% from July through September. Strong consumer spending powered economic growth over this period, helping to offset weak business investment and a drop in U.S. exports. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal forecast GDP growth was unrevised at a 3.5% annual rate in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department releases data on new-home sales for October. Purchases of newly built single-family homes—a relatively narrow slice of all U.S. home sales—fell 5.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 553,000 in September. This marked the fourth monthly fall for new-home sales and underscored a weak stretch in the housing sector. Economists surveyed by the Journal forecast new-home sales clocked in at an annual rate of 575,000 in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THURSDAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department releases personal-income, consumer spending and inflation figures for October. Personal income, reflecting Americans' pretax earnings from salaries and investments, edged up 0.2% in September, while consumer spending increased a seasonally adjusted 0.4% in September from the prior month. Core prices, the report showed, were up 2.0% from a year earlier. Economists surveyed by the Journal forecast personal-income grew 0.4% in October; they forecast core PCE prices increased 1.9% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FRIDAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China releases its official gauge of factory activity for November. Economists expect China's official purchasing managers index to inch closer to 50, compared with October's 50.2. Continued softness in the leading indicator points to weakening confidence toward future operations among Chinese manufacturers due to rising uncertainties from a trade spat with the U.S[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/china-weighs-skipping-trade-talks-after-u-s-tariff-threat-1537115334].</p>

Amazon: Amazon's Plans Cool Seattle's Housing</span>
</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto </div><div>619 words</div><div>21 November 2018</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B9</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2018 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Amazon.com Inc</span>.'s announcement last week that it will add new headquarters in New York and Virginia, far from its hometown, injects new uncertainty into the already slowing Seattle market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seattle home sales are already down this year compared with last and home price growth has eased. Price cuts are becoming more common and bidding wars more scarce. Rental landlords are struggling to lure tenants, promising perks like free rent and $2,500 <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> gift cards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Amazon</span> has increased its head count in Seattle to 45,000 people from 5,000 over the past eight years. At the same time, home prices have increased about 50%, driven by the expansion of <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> and other technology firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are a range of reasons for the slowdown over the past six months, but one has been anxiety over <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s growth in the city, local brokers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> will remain in Seattle and is expected to keep adding jobs there, the Long Island City and Crystal City locations, in New York and Northern Virginia, are likely to divert the spotlight and could slow that momentum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you've got that much going on and you're really trying to get New York and Virginia up and running, you have a tendency to ignore Seattle," said Greg Willett, chief economist at RealPage Inc., an apartment-data company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to slower hiring, some <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> employees could decide to move to one of the new headquarters. According to Redfin, a Seattle-based real-estate brokerage, if one in 20 <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> employees in the city were to list their homes that could lead to a roughly 10% increase in listings in the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin and a former behavioral economist at Amazon, said buyers who relocated to Seattle from the Northeast may decide to move back home. She said one friend who works at <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> already has her mom calling and asking if she's going to relocate back to the Washington, D.C., area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On balance, however, economists and real-estate agents said the <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> news is benign compared with the negative effect that rising interest rates and high prices are having in deterring buyers. In October, the median home value in the Seattle metropolitan area grew 7.1% from a year earlier -- the slowest pace of appreciation since January 2013, according to Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The announcement of the HQ2 winners could even provide a small boost to Seattle's slowing housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For one, the winning cities are just as, if not more, expensive than Seattle, alleviating fears there would be an exodus of <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> employees to a new location where housing is more affordable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> had announced it was moving to a location where homes were more affordable, it may have been compelling for someone to leave," said Seattle Redfin agent Jessie Culbert.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow saw a roughly 400% increase in online searches for listings in the Long Island City and Crystal City areas on the day <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> announced the HQ2 winners. But only a small share of those searches have come from Seattle, said Aaron Terrazas, a senior economist at Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The greater impact may be on the apartment market because <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> employees tend to be young urban dwellers who live in the high rises in and around the downtown core, said Matthew Gardner, chief economist at Seattle-based real-estate brokerage Windermere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rents in downtown Seattle and the South Lake Union area, near <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s headquarters, have actually fallen about 2% this year, according to <span class="companylink">RealPage</span>. Rents rose about 3% nationally during that period.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. housing starts rose last month on a bounceback in multifamily building, but underlying figures signal weakness in the construction pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts climbed 1.5% in October from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.228 million, the Commerce Department said Tuesday [https://www-census-gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf]. The growth was due to a rebound in construction of buildings with two or more units. Starts fell in October for single-family construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential building permits, which can signal how much construction is planned, dropped 0.6% from September to an annual pace of 1.263 million last month. Permits were down for single-family homes as well as buildings with multiple units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer optimism toward home buying is waning and builders are beginning to take note, said Danielle Hale, chief economist for realtor.com, in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Looking ahead, starts could slip further if builders believe the consumer pause will continue and they adjust production accordingly," Ms. Hale said, pointing to rising home prices and mortgage rates as hurdles to home buying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cost increases for materials are also adding to builders' challenge of constructing homes at lower-price points, economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing-starts data are volatile from month to month and can be subject to large revisions. October's 1.5% increase for starts came with a margin of error of 12.9 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The broader trend shows some pickup this year, as starts grew by 5.6% in the first 10 months of 2018 compared with the same period a year earlier. This growth is modest, though, given strong economic growth this year and a historically low unemployment rate [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/wages-rise-at-fastest-rate-in-nearly-a-decade-as-hiring-jumps-in-october-1541161920]—conditions that normally tend to buoy demand for new homes. Factors such as rising prices and borrowing costs  [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/mortgage-rates-fast-approaching-5-a-fresh-blow-to-housing-market-1539266400]are locking some would-be buyers out of the market.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A gauge of U.S. home-builder confidence fell sharply in November, dragged down by heightened affordability concerns in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> on Monday said its housing-market index dropped by eight points to a reading of 60 in November, well below economists' expectations and the lowest level in more than two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index measures builder confidence in the market for new single-family homes. Figures over 50 mean more builders see conditions as good rather than bad, which means that, despite the November drop, builder sentiment is still in positive terrain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">November's drop reflects builders' rising concerns over faltering demand in light of climbing interest rates and home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Labor shortages and rising regulatory costs have held down single-family construction for several years, said Robert Dietz, NAHB chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While home price growth accommodated increasing construction costs during this period, rising mortgage interest rates in recent months coupled with the cumulative run-up in pricing has caused housing demand to stall," Mr. Dietz said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sentiment measures of current sales conditions, sales expectations and buyer traffic all fell in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said Hurricanes Florence and Michael [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/hurricane-michael-to-test-floridas-unique-insurance-market-1539250200] could have pushed down builder sentiment, so a December rebound is possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Indeed, once the hurricane distortions fade from the new home sales numbers, we expect to see a clear rebound for the next few months, before the underlying softening trend re-emerges," Mr. Shepherdson said in a note to clients. "The housing market is softening, but it is not melting down, and these data likely overdo the gloom."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index touched the highest level in 18 years in December, and pulled back this year as supply constraints  [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-dropped-in-september-1539957950?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=8]and an affordability crunch continued to weigh on the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though home-price growth has moderated in recent months, it has outpaced wage growth for years, making homes out of reach for many first-time buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, mortgage rates  are approaching 5%. [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/mortgage-rates-fast-approaching-5-a-fresh-blow-to-housing-market-1539266400?mod=article_inline]

</div><div class="author">By Micah Maidenberg </div><div>690 words</div><div>14 November 2018</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2018 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising construction costs and a tight labor market are slowing a nearly decadelong apartment boom, likely easing a burgeoning glut at the top end of the market that has been forming across the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Multifamily building permits have fallen each month since March, according to federal data. That type of slowdown suggests there should be less new apartment construction over the next two years, the typical time it takes to build an apartment property of any scale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts say absorption of new units remains strong right now, despite the falloff in permitting. While landlords may be frustrated that their projects are taking longer to complete, the slowdown in new building should help reduce oversupply concerns and could enable owners to raise rents at a faster pace next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If supply is pinched, rent negotiations "would definitely favor landlords more than tenants going forward," said Barbara Byrne Denham, senior economist at Reis, a property consultancy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some big apartment developers have indicated that budding concerns about oversupply are abating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It appears we're beginning to see some early signs of relief in supply, as both permits and starts have been declining in our markets for most of the year," Timothy Naughton, chief executive of apartment developer AvalonBay Communities Inc., told analysts on a conference call last month. AvalonBay may start benefiting from less development by as soon as late 2019, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers raced to put up new multifamily buildings after the recession in 2009, a scramble generated by the dearth of investment during the downturn and the growing demand for rental properties after the housing bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rents steadily rose on stronger demand from young people getting their first places and consumers who couldn't obtain financing to buy homes. But that growth has slowed over the past couple of years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2011, developers completed 129,900 units in buildings with at least five units, according to the Census Bureau. Completed properties with at least five units have risen each year since then, and developers added almost 347,000 units in 2017. As supply has grown, rent growth has weakened, hitting 2.9% nationally in the third quarter compared with more than 5% three years earlier, according to real-estate analytics firm <span class="companylink">RealPage Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The demand is there," said Paula Munger, the <span class="companylink">National Apartment Association</span>'s director of industry research and analysis, referring to tenants. "But labor's a big deal. It varies by position, but in general that's what we're hearing from our members. The actual completions are being more and more delayed for that reason."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartment developers on the West Coast are particularly struggling to finish off their projects. <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span>, the nation's largest apartment owner, found that a dearth of construction workers in the Los Angeles area means 2,000 rental units the company expected to be delivered this year now will arrive in 2019 instead, Chief Operating Officer Michael Manelis said in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Essex Property Trust</span>, an apartment firm with holdings in Northern and Southern California and the Seattle region, also indicated recently that the 3,000 units it expected this year will instead arrive in 2019, and another 3,000 rentals it forecast for 2019 won't come online until 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With housing demand continuing to exceed supply, we believe that housing shortages on the West Coast will continue," said Essex CEO Michael Schall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to rising costs, worries about future job growth -- a driver of apartment demand -- and the slower rent growth has damped permitting activity, Ms. Denham said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September, builders pulled permits to construct 351,000 units in new properties with at least five units on an annualized basis, down 9% from a year earlier, according to the latest data available from the Census Bureau. In March, that figure was 486,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Munger said demand for apartments remains robust. Luxury rentals in large coastal markets have faced the most pressure after years of building, she added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction firms in California are paying more to ensure they have staff on hand.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hey, what about HQ1?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seattle, the sole home of <span class="companylink">Amazon.com</span>, will soon be one of three headquarters for the e-commerce company. That, and other factors, are soaking real-estate prices in the famously rainy city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of unsold homes in Washington state's King County has doubled in just a year and nearly tripled for condominiums, according to the Seattle Times[https://www.seattletimes.com/business/real-estate/seattle-home-prices-down-80000-from-peak-amid-unprecedented-spike-in-homes-sitting-unsold/]. In the city of Seattle itself, median home prices are down by a whopping $80,000 since the spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though it is no consolation for people trying to sell, Seattle is still an expensive place to live. The two locations for <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s HQ2, northern Virginia and New York City, aren't exactly cheap either.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of home-improvement stocks have suffered sharp losses over the past month as the housing market continues to slump, pressured by rising interest rates and higher materials costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent data have shown the U.S. economy remains on solid footing, with strong hiring handing workers their best pay raises in nearly a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But housing remains a weak spot. Existing-home sales have fallen for seven straight months, marking the longest slump since 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes haven't fared much better, falling for four straight months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is partly because rising borrowing costs have pushed up mortgage rates, while pricier materials have limited both new construction and consumer spending on remodeling and maintenance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of paint maker <span class="companylink">Sherwin-Williams Co</span>. have been hit hard, shedding 6% over the past month, compared with a 4.7% fall for the S&amp;P 500. Cabinet maker <span class="companylink">American Woodmark Corp</span>. and flooring maker <span class="companylink">Mohawk Industries Inc</span>. have tumbled 13% and 24%, respectively, while window maker <span class="companylink">Jeld-Wen Holding Inc</span>. has plunged 29%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of home-improvement retailers <span class="companylink">Home Depot Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Lowe's Co</span>. haven't been immune from the recent selloff, falling 5% and 8%, respectively, over the past month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks of home-building companies have likewise suffered a bruising 2018. Shares of <span class="companylink">Hovnanian Enterprises Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Beazer Homes USA Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> and <span class="companylink">NVR Inc</span>. each have lost at least one-third of their value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising rates are likely squeezing first-time home buyers, particularly among millennials, said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel, in some cases leaving them with smaller budgets for renovations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowing costs for mortgages are quickly approaching 5%, levels not seen since 2011. The rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to 4.83% last week, according to mortgage-finance giant <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. That compares with 3.95% at the start of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Younger generations don't remember when mortgage rates were 13%, 15% or even 20%," Ms. Piegza said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For them, that may stall or completely deter them from making that purchase."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. tariffs, meanwhile, have raised the costs of aluminum and steel, while a labor shortage in the construction sector has caused home building and remodeling to slow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one bright spot for builders and home-improvement companies, the cost of lumber has decreased. Futures have fallen 24% in 2018, settling Wednesday at $341.30 per thousand board feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists are debating whether the recent data mark a soft patch as buyers readjust their finances or a shift in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traditionally, most remodeling has been associated with preparing to sell or buy an existing home, said Robert Dietz, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If we're now in an environment where existing-home sales are going to post small declines for the rest of the economic cycle, then that will weigh on the demand for remodeling even if homeowner wealth rises," Mr. Dietz said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The largest share of manufacturers in at least a decade is spending to expand facilities, as companies look to build plants closer to their customers to offset record trucking costs and seek out pockets of available workers in a tight labor market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twelve percent of U.S. manufacturers that invested in added capacity at domestic factories in the second quarter did so through building expansions, according to the Census Bureau, the highest proportion in the decade that metric has been released. Manufacturing construction spending hit a 16-month high in September, according to the Census Bureau. Executives are making some of those investments in new factories to alleviate rising transport bills and supply-chain bottlenecks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Ferrellgas Partners LP</span> added two plants in recent months to make and refill its <span class="companylink">Blue Rhino</span> propane tanks closer to customers. The new factories in Alabama and California will allow the company to cut over a dozen delivery routes and lower costs by as much as $3 million annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The freight savings is so extraordinary," said Paul Haeder, Blue Rhino's director of production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of U.S. factories where executives said material shortages and logistics problems were limiting output was also the highest in a decade in the second quarter, the Census Bureau said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Italian tissue-paper maker Sofidel Group opened its sixth U.S. plant in Circleville, Ohio, in October. It plans to open another in Oklahoma in 2020, to make its products as close to customers as possible to speed up delivery times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our products are very light in weight and very bulky," Chief Executive Luigi Lazzareschi said. He added that Sofidel tries to keep its U.S. transportation journeys to below 700 miles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The expansion comes as unemployment is at the lowest point in nearly half a century. Manufacturing payrolls rose by 32,000 workers in October, the biggest monthly increase this year. Consumer confidence and wages are rising, and many companies are counteracting higher costs by raising prices on the expectation that consumers are willing to pay more as the economy charges ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Expanding in a strong economy has its risks. Operating multiple factories or warehouses increases the amount of inventory needed to fulfill the same amount of demand, according to logistics experts, which increases costs. While companies benefit from solid demand for their goods, it also can lead to higher interest rates. A rising rate environment causes loans for building to be more expensive and inventory becomes more costly compared with cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A strong economy could both be a blessing and a curse," said Yemisi Bolumole, a supply-chain management professor at Michigan State University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of building factories, some manufacturers are making investments and strengthening supply chains to existing plants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Travel-trailer-maker Airstream, owned by <span class="companylink">Thor Industries Inc</span>., broke ground in August on a $40 million factory adjacent to its existing plant in Jackson Center, Ohio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airstream CEO Bob Wheeler said the company thought about building a plant in the Western U.S., near many of its customers, but decided against it. "We just didn't have any confidence we could re-create the workforce," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies building plants nearer to customers say the investment costs can be made up in faster turnaround times and increased orders.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sarah Krouse, Laura Kusisto and Tom McGinty </div><div>2048 words</div><div>1 November 2018</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2018 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three-bedroom house. Ocean views. Steps from the water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was once a surefire home-sales pitch. Today, some buyers fear a warmer climate will bring fiercer floodwaters, winds and hurricanes -- and that has changed the math of waterfront real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I can't get anybody to come look at it," said real-estate agent Angela Payne, describing a four-bedroom home with river views near the coast in Somerset County, Md. She has been seeking a buyer for six months. The sellers reduced the price to $219,000 in October from $224,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The area does have some flooding," she said of the property, which is in a federally designated flood zone, "so it's hard to get someone to invest that kind of money in a house when they see that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The value of homes in Somerset County flood zones at a high risk of flooding had risen 10.5% from 2012 to 2017, while homes in the county not facing that risk rose 14.4%, an examination by The Wall Street Journal found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The effects of the planet's slow heating are diffuse and its causes are debated. That hasn't stopped climate-change expectations filtering into business decisions and values of financial assets. In coastal residential real estate, those expectations are turning an old dictum on its head. "Location, location, location" is receding from the waterline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Up and down the eastern seaboard, many home prices near water's edge aren't doing as well as homes inland in the same county, a Journal examination found. Real-estate brokers, homeowners and prospective buyers say a big reason is the perception that climate change is making such properties a riskier investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To compare changes in waterfront single-family home prices with those inland for the Journal examination, the real-estate information provider Realtor.com analyzed median prices per square foot in and out of designated high-risk flood zones in 16 coastal states between 2012 and 2017. A subsidiary of <span class="companylink">News Corp</span>, the Journal's owner, operates Realtor.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 40 of the 66 counties in the analysis, the prices of homes in high-risk flood zones failed to keep pace with those in areas not deemed at risk of flooding. In 2015, that phenomenon happened in 10 fewer counties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Buyers are more aware. Recent events are fresher in their minds," said Javier Vivas, senior analyst at Realtor.com, referring to hurricanes and large storms this year and last. "Because of that awareness they are more skeptical or at least more knowledgeable about this real, tangible risk."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hurricane Florence in September inflicted an estimated $20 billion to $30 billion of damage from winds and flooding on residential and commercial properties across North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, according to housing-data tracker <span class="companylink">CoreLogic Inc</span>. Hurricane Michael a month ago caused $2.5 billion to $4 billion of damage in Florida, it said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Waterfront property has traditionally commanded a premium. That is still the case, but the premium shrank to 36% in April 2018 nationwide from the two-decade average of 41%, according to real-estate-listings company Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cost of staying is among deterrents to ownership. Lifting a house to protect against flooding can cost from $10,000 to upward of $100,000, depending on size, said Michael Brovont, sales manager at Wolfe House Movers in Bernville, Pa., which does such coastal raising work. That doesn't include the cost of permits, unhooking and re-establishing electricity and plumbing during the lift, or rebuilding the foundation, and of paying rent to live elsewhere during the process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The estimated National Flood Insurance Program premium for $250,000 in building coverage for a primary residence in a high-risk flood zone is about $2,199, compared with an estimated $1,559 for a home in a low-risk zone, according to the <span class="companylink">Federal Emergency Management Agency</span>. In the highest-risk area that rises to an estimated $9,315.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The analysis for the Journal incorporated 1.2 million home sales in Realtor.com's data, using flood zones determined by FEMA to identify properties near water. The analysis excluded some states, such as Texas and Louisiana, where deed-level data aren't disclosed, and Western states such as California, where many coastal residences sit higher above water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alabama, Florida, North Carolina and Maryland now have more counties where high-risk flood-zone property is lagging than before, the analysis shows. The trend occurred in a limited number of areas in the West, including one county in Oregon and two in Hawaii.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even where home buyers decide to be near water, "the desire to live three or four houses off the water versus right along the water has increased significantly" because of flooding concerns and rising flood-insurance costs, said Michael Hoffman, a real-estate agent at <span class="companylink">William Raveis Real Estate</span> in Scituate, a town in Plymouth County, Mass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Florida, house prices in high-risk flood zones failed to keep pace with prices in low-risk zones in 20 counties around the state's long coastline. Hurricane Michael made landfall in October in Bay County, Fla., where single-family home prices in high-risk flood zones rose 23% between 2012 and 2017, while those outside such zones rose 32%. In neighboring Gulf County, high-risk flood-zone home prices rose 42% during that period while homes further inland rose 89%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are reasons beyond climate risk that some inland homes have appreciated more. Certain inland counties are home to fast-growing communities that have drawn more buyers. Municipal-finance problems in some states have led to higher taxes on the wealthy that have spurred affluent coastal dwellers to depart for lower-tax jurisdictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some brokers and academics also contend that prices on the coast are already high, leading to lower percentage growth in median prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Journal findings dovetail with recent research. A <span class="companylink">Harvard University</span> study in May showed home prices at lower elevations are suffering, while once-modest neighborhoods on higher ground in Miami-Dade County, Fla., are appreciating more quickly, by virtue of their geography. <span class="companylink">University of Colorado</span> researchers studying data from 2007 through 2016 found homes vulnerable to rising sea levels across the country are selling at a 7% discount to similar but less-exposed properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pricing shift affects homeowners, insurance companies, lenders and the finances of towns and cities. <span class="companylink">Moody's Investors Service</span>, which rates the creditworthiness of municipalities -- and thus how much they have to pay to borrow money -- warned in November 2017 that rising sea levels and more extreme weather could spur "steady migration that undermines local economies" and redistributes wealth, workers and demand for public services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the Journal examination, Realtor.com gathered single-family home sales data in more than 470 coastal counties on the East and West coasts and bordering the Great Lakes. It whittled that to the 66 coastal counties that met a number of flood-zone and deed-disclosure-related criteria.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's what life looks like, and how it has changed, in three states facing storm risks:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Connecticut</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Fairfield County, Conn., homes in areas with a high risk of flooding actually appreciated at a faster rate than those further inland between 2012 and 2017. But coastal properties that faced additional risk because of waves -- those right at the water's edge -- lost value. The median price per square foot of homes at the highest risk of flooding in the county declined 26.1% between 2012 and 2017, while it rose 3.2% for homes at a low risk of flooding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flood risks coupled with the state's deteriorating financial health have weighed on sales volumes this year, deterring potential buyers and making home sellers there "despondent" in recent years, said Peter Stuart, a real-estate agent there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of his customers who expected to sell a waterfront four-bedroom home for $2.5 million instead sold it for $2.2 million in the summer of 2017 despite investing heavily to renovate it and raise it up 10 feet. That client moved to a town further inland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Florida</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Florida is ground zero of coastal concerns. In Monroe County, home to Key Largo, the value of homes in high-risk flood zones rose 32% from 2012 to 2017; in low-risk zones, they rose 83%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yvette Toledo-Baste, a real-estate agent at Horizon Homes Realty in the Florida Keys, is closing on the sale of a four-bedroom Key Largo home for owners who want to move further inland in Miami. The home sold for $940,000, below the $1.125 million it was initially listed for more than a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lindsay Carriera, her boyfriend, Josh Paul Dykstra, and his 12-year-old son moved from Sussex County, N.J., to Florida for a better quality of life in August 2017, just before Hurricane Irma hit and they were forced to evacuate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Knowing that we could potentially come home to nothing was very upsetting," Ms. Carriera said. The couple looked at more than a dozen coastal homes, but Mr. Dykstra ultimately bought a three-bedroom home further inland in Charlotte County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It kills us not to be able to walk out back and see water," said Ms. Carriera, 27, but "you would be spending more money to upkeep it than actually enjoying it and that's why we went inland. I guess it's just peace of mind." Mr. Dykstra bought a the newly constructed home for about $240,000 and the pair plan to move in November. The value of Charlotte County single-family homes in high-risk flood zones rose 59.2% between 2012 and 2017, compared with a 76.5% increase in the value homes further inland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Jersey</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Ocean County, N.J., a middle-class, coastal county home to multilevel beachfront houses and small summer bungalows, the value of high-risk flood-zone homes rose 1% between 2012 and the end of last year. The value of inland homes rose 26%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scale of that difference was a surprise even to Annmarie Uhl, who knows well the potential costs of repairing and retrofitting a home on the coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She and her husband saved for 20 years and by 2008 had enough for a down payment on an $820,000 four-bedroom cape in Beach Haven. Its prior owner had lifted the home 4 feet off the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four years later, Hurricane Sandy's rising tides flooded their house beyond repair. The couple received nearly $35,000 in insurance money, but they couldn't fully repair their home's electrical and plumbing systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The year after Sandy, they spent $10,000 on new plumbing and electric systems and $3,000 on landscaping to keep water at bay. The next year, the home's pipes damaged by the storm, burst and cost another $20,000 to repair. That year, the couple discovered mold had grown in their kitchen, requiring them to rip out the cabinetry, a $25,000 expense. Then their electric system broke again. "We could never restore the house to where it was pre-Sandy," Ms. Uhl said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They weighed rebuilding against selling at a loss and ultimately decided to tear down the old home and build a new one. It cost $500,000. This time they have forgone costly flood insurance. "We're 10 feet off the ground. If we get that much water and it floods our house we're done and flood insurance is not going to cover it," Ms. Uhl said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the Uhls, Phyllis Sardoni, still a schoolteacher at 83, is holding out. She raised her two-bedroom home near the Jersey Shore 12 feet after Hurricane Sandy and plans to remain there indefinitely. She climbs the 12 steps it now takes to reach her front door, tends to her garden where wildflower seeds carried in by Sandy bloom, and regularly moves her car in anticipation of high tides. "I have the beach house, which is what I've always wanted," she said. "It's everything it should be."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Annual home-price gains fell below 6% for the first time in a year in August, another sign that the slowdown in the housing market is becoming widespread and is likely to persist in the months to come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which measures average home prices in major metropolitan areas across the nation, rose 5.8% in the year ended in August, down from a 6% year-over-year increase reported in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price gains accelerated for most of the past two years, growing significantly faster than both incomes and inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">August marked the fifth straight month of decelerating price gains, as interest rates have risen and inventory in some markets has been growing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home buyers "must be breathing a collective sigh of relief that home price growth finally has slowed," said Skylar Olsen, Zillow's director of economic research and outreach. Ms. Olsen said the slowing appreciation "is a sign that fierce competition is dying down."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller 10-city index gained 5.1% over the year, down significantly for the second straight month from 5.5% the prior month. The 20-city index gained 5.5%, down from 5.9% the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fourteen out of 20 cities are showing slower price growth than a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas had the fastest home price growth in the country for the third straight month, at 13.9%, followed by San Francisco, where prices grew 10.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seattle, where Realtors have reported a significant pullback in buyer demand in recent months, fell to third place with a 9.6% annual gain in prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
David Blitzer, managing director at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, said that even though there is a pullback in the housing market, there are no signs that the current weakness will become a repeat of the crisis in 2008 because mortgage-default rates remain low. "Without a collapse in housing finance like the one seen 12 years ago, a crash in home prices is unlikely," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than five years of rapidly rising prices, combined with higher mortgage rates are making homes increasingly unaffordable for buyers. Rates for a 30-year mortgage averaged 4.86% last week, up nearly a full percentage point from the beginning of the year, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> said Thursday. Because Case-Shiller home-price data lags behind by a couple of months, it doesn't yet reflect the most recent run-up in rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Coupled with mortgage rate increases that picked up steam in September, higher prices are stifling home sales as more buyers are priced out of the market," said Danielle Hale, chief economist for Realtor.com.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">U.S. government</span> bonds weakened Tuesday as a rebound in risky assets helped investors look past disappointing housing data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The yield on the benchmark 10-year <span class="companylink">U.S. Treasury</span> settled at 3.111%, according to <span class="companylink">Tradeweb</span>, compared with 3.083% Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bond yields, which rise as prices fall, fell to session lows after <span class="companylink">S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices</span> data showed average home prices in major metropolitan areas around the U.S. rose 5.8% in the year through August, marking the first reading below 6% in a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report was the latest to suggest that the housing market is starting to slow down, hurt by rising mortgage rates that have crimped affordability for many buyers. Some uneven data, plus heightened volatility across financial markets, have recently diminished traders' confidence in the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> being able to raise rates multiple times over the next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal-funds futures, used to place bets on interest rates, late Tuesday showed a 28.7% chance of the Fed pushing through three interest-rate increases by June 2019 -- down from 34% one week ago, according to <span class="companylink">CME Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bond yields later pared some of their declines as stocks opened higher on the day, reversing a sharp slide from Monday that had taken the S&amp;P 500 to the verge of correction territory -- a 10% decline from a recent high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the recent action in the bond market has followed fluctuations in stocks, said Ian Lyngen, head of <span class="companylink">U.S. government</span> debt strategy at <span class="companylink">BMO Capital Markets</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've heard the expression 'we're all stock traders now' several times this morning," Mr. Lyngen said in a note.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Millennial Buyers Drive Uptick In Homeownership; Share of households who own their home and are headed by someone under 35 was up 1.2 percentage points from a year earlier</span>
</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto </div><div>532 words</div><div>30 October 2018</div><div>13:14</div><div>WSJ Pro Central Banking</div><div>RSTPROCB</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2018, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. homeownership rate edged higher in the third quarter, driven by many young buyers entering the housing market for the first time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The share of households who own their home and are headed by someone under 35 years old rose to 36.8% in the third quarter from 36.5% in the second quarter, and was up 1.2 percentage points from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was significantly more than the overall increase in the homeownership rate. The share of American households that own a home inched up to 64.4% in the third quarter, up from 64.3% in the second quarter and up half a percentage point from a year earlier, according to data released Tuesday by the <span class="companylink">U.S. Census Bureau</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The recovery is now at this point driven by first-time home buyers and not older generations," said Skylar Olsen, director of economic research and outreach at Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The homeownership rate data aren't terribly reliable and this quarter's change wasn't considered statistically significant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, it is clear that homeownership is once again on the rise, a rare bright spot for a housing market suffering from weaker sales and construction starts along with decelerating price gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. homeownership rate has been moving steadily upward since the beginning of 2017 and has solidly rebounded from a 50-year low [https://blogs-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/economics/2016/07/28/u-s-homeownership-rate-falls-to-five-decade-low/] of 62.9% in mid-2016. Nonetheless, it remains below the long-term norm of around 65%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Middle-aged households, millions of whom lost their homes during the housing crash, continue to struggle. The homeownership rate among households headed by someone 35 to 44 years old fell half a percentage point to 59.5% over the quarter. The rate among households headed by someone 45 to 50 years old fell by nearly a full percentage point to 69.7% over the quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Those who are hit hardest are not those recovering," Ms. Olsen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are 1.5 million more owner households in the U.S. than a year ago, according to the census. That growth is at odds with lackluster levels of both new and existing-home sales, as well as flagging home-price growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists struggle to explain the disconnect, except to say that some households are managing to overcome high prices and a lack of inventory to buy homes. But they warn that may not be sustainable for long.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Paradoxically, the rise of first-time home buyers, which has pushed home prices up, also is slowing home sales today. These events caused the homeownership rate and home sales to diverge this quarter," said Tian Liu, chief economist at Genworth Mortgage Insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was some good news in Tuesday's report for rental landlords, who have seen rising vacancy rates and rents flatten or even decline in major cities. The number of renter households increased slightly, by 60,000, compared with a year earlier, according to the census.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What the 33-year-old energy-company manager didn't know was that it would take her six months and $1.4 million to buy a 4,000-square-foot, three-bedroom, 3 1/2-bathroom house in the former middle-class enclave.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across town, in the affluent, manicured suburb of Bellaire, James Holland, a top executive at one of the largest energy-infrastructure companies in North America, spent an unexpected four-plus months to sell his stately brick 4,600-square-foot, four-bedroom, four-bathroom house with a generous backyard. And it took a price cut to get it done, dropping from $1.179 million to $902,000. Mr. Holland's home didn't flood during Harvey but his neighborhood did, and the area remains spotted with empty houses, teardowns and land lots for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year after Harvey hit, home sales in Houston are up 37.2% over 2017 and up 7.2% from two years ago (a fairer comparison because the hurricane halted activity for weeks in 2017). Some 8% of the people affected by the storm still haven't been able to return to their homes, and 15% of damaged homes remain unlivable, according to a report by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Episcopal Health Foundation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hurricanes like those that have pummeled the coastal U.S. can dramatically alter the real-estate map of cities. In addition to the arduous task of rebuilding, even well-established cities experience changes in the dynamics of individual neighborhoods. As might be expected, prices in areas that flooded tend to drop, while prices in areas with minimal damage appreciate. But even homes on streets that see little water can still be hard to sell because of greater damage nearby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The contrasting fates of neighborhoods post-hurricane in Houston is illustrated by the Heights and Bellaire. "There has been a knee-jerk reaction from certain buyers who avoid regions completely," says Paige Martin, a broker with <span class="companylink">Keller Williams Realty</span>. "We are seeing value in these areas."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the gentrifying Heights, old Craftsman and Victorian homes are being remodeled, large homes are going up on small lots, and new and rebuilt restaurants, stores and coffee shops are opening. Old car lots make way for new home developments, while family-owned hardware businesses stand strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price of homes in the Heights rose 8.2% to-date in 2018 from the year earlier, according to the Houston MLS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, in traditionally affluent Bellaire, the median sales price of homes fell 11.8% over that same period. Blocks of houses sit empty as if frozen in time, with family photos still on the walls, appliances removed and patio furniture covered. Some are waiting to be torn down; others are in the process of being elevated -- about two feet -- off the ground to comply with new building codes. Vacant lots with for-sale signs are interspersed with partially finished new construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Caserta, a 45-year-old high-level manager at ExxonMobil, searched for a year for a house when he moved to Houston from Chicago last November. At first he was interested in Bellaire, but changed his mind when his friends who lived in the Heights assured him they'd had no flooding in any of the city's major storms. That broke his initial apprehension about the neighborhood's juxtaposition of million-dollar homes with tire shops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I started to see the charm and character through the noise," he says. He marked off a 15-block radius, but when he couldn't find a home there, he ended up buying a 3,600-square-foot newly built house for $1.22 million just outside his targeted area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kara Goodloe has been looking for a house in the Heights for about four months. "You have to be really patient and jump on something when it comes up," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 40-year-old chief operating officer for an energy private-equity firm has lived in the neighborhood twice before, in-between stints in New York and Oklahoma. But this time around, she says, it has been harder to find a home because there are no medium-size houses. They are either small and need to be torn down, are approaching 4,000 square feet with no yard, or are too expensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few months ago, she put in a bid for a four-bedroom house she describes as "worn" and "needing a lot of work" that was $20,000 over its $1.29 million asking price, only to be told there were six offers and that it sold for $125,000 over asking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Reiser, 65, a broker for oil and gas insurance for upstream energy producers, says he decided to build in the Heights because it has a higher elevation than other parts of the city -- and so less of a propensity to flood. "I'm not a risk taker," he says. In addition, he liked that the Heights is a shorter commute to downtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He bought a 6,500-square-foot lot for $600,000 and spent $1.1 million building his 4,875-square-foot, four bedroom, 4 1/2-bathroom house, finished in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recovery of other areas of the city is just as complicated. Houston's map looks like a spider web. An inner loop is ringed by Highway 610, and around it is another loop, defined by the Beltway. For people who work downtown, the most desirous high-end neighborhoods are in the Inner Loop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No Inner Loop neighborhood was immune to Harvey's destruction, but the storm's impact varied greatly, depending in part on how close streets were to a bayou -- the waterways that run through the city. These bayous, which affect what areas are considered part of the floodplains, were hurt by two other events: the Tax Day 2016 flood and the Memorial Day 2015 flood, both of which reached what are called 500-year-storm levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">River Oaks -- an old-money area with its own private security force, where large stone and brick mansions line wide streets -- was a prime spot for media images of wealthy residents and their pets being rescued by boat in Harvey's aftermath. In reality, only the streets along the area's Buffalo Bayou -- known as Billionaire's Row -- along with the country club's golf course, flooded. The rest of the neighborhood didn't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price of homes in River Oaks has shot up 22.6% year-to-date compared with a year earlier. For some residents, such as plastic surgeon Forrest Roth, there is no other luxury neighborhood in Houston. "Nothing else comes close," he says. Dr. Roth has put his house on the market for $3.749 million because he is looking to downsize, but says he plans to stay in the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kathleen and David Hochberg never really considered buying in Bellaire because of the flooding, among other reasons. They chose River Oaks, where they bought a 5,000-square-foot house on a 10,000-square-foot lot for double the amount they'd intended to spend. Even so, the couple felt the effect of the storm when they tried to hire contractors, who are in high demand, to help with renovations such as painting and putting in new floors, cabinets and sinks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It took much longer and was way more expensive than it should have been," says Mrs. Hochberg. In the end they spent an additional $200,000, and Mr. Hochberg did the outlets himself to avoid a $20,000 electrician fee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phil Pyle, president of Enerflex's International Business, and his wife, Lucia Cheng, bought a newly built, 5,100-square-foot, four-bedroom, four-bathroom contemporary house with iron and glass doors, soaring ceilings and reclaimed beams for $2.65 million in April. They found a section of an Inner Loop neighborhood called West University that didn't have flooding. They had studied Houston's floodplain maps from their high rise in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You'd have to be crazy not to do that," says Mr. Pyle. The couple plan to live in the home for 10 years and "want to enjoy peace of mind from flood risk."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some Houston housing experts say the Harvey effect won't last long, and that neighborhoods like Bellaire that might be down now are where opportunity lies. There is skepticism that climate change will lead to another event of Harvey's magnitude anytime soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People forget," says Chris Kelso, a branch manager with HomeTown Lenders, who has already noticed clients ignoring the section of closing statements that address a property's risk of flooding. "In the end, people will live where they want to live."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-Home Sales Fall</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Inventories Swell</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes in the U.S. slumped for the fourth consecutive month and inventories swelled to the highest level in years, suggesting the housing market is falling deeper into a weak stretch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of newly built single-family homes -- a relatively narrow slice of all U.S. home sales -- fell 5.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 553,000 in September, according to fresh data from the Commerce Department. This is the slowest rate in about two years. Meanwhile, inventory rose to a 7.1 months' supply, the highest level since March 2011.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. Treasurys extended a rally Wednesday as downbeat data on the domestic housing market and eurozone manufacturing sapped investors' appetite for risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The yield on the benchmark 10-year <span class="companylink">U.S. Treasury</span> note settled at 3.122%, compared with 3.166% Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yields, which fall as bond prices rise, declined overnight after <span class="companylink">IHS Markit</span> reports showed manufacturing activity in the eurozone, Germany and France expanded at a slower pace than analysts had expected in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treasury yields then fell further after Commerce Department data showed sales of new U.S. homes fell 5.5% in September, notching their fourth consecutive monthly decline and far surpassing the 0.6% drop that economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taken together, the data added to a recent streak of tepid economic reports, driving up demand for Treasurys, which investors tend to scoop up when the growth outlook appears more uncertain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Fed's rising interest rates may be more harmful for economic growth than they thought, chiefly because of its effect on long-term interest rates and hence mortgage rates," said Chris Rupkey, managing director and chief financial economist at MUFG.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Sales of new homes in the U.S. slumped for the fourth-consecutive month and inventories swelled to the highest level in years, suggesting the housing market is falling deeper into a weak stretch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of newly built single-family homes—a relatively narrow slice of all U.S. home sales—fell 5.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 553,000 in September, according to fresh data from the Commerce Department. This is the slowest rate in about two years. Meanwhile, inventory rose to a 7.1 months' supply, the highest level since March 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While job and income gains remain solid, rising prices and mortgage rates have decreased affordability for some homebuyers and appear to be reducing housing demand on the margins," said Nationwide Senior Economist Ben Ayers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost all U.S. regions experienced new-home sales declines last month, with the West seeing the largest monthly drop since the end of last year. That region has struggled with intense price growth in markets like Seattle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the broader housing market, inventory has been tight, driving up home prices and pricing some potential buyers out of the market. At the same time, skilled construction labor shortages, rising input costs and rising mortgage rates are also making home buying more expensive. Sales of previously owned homes fell 3.4% in September from the previous month, continuing the longest slump for such sales in four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent spate of weak sales for new and existing homes could have downstream effects on other industries. When someone buys a new home, they typically require all kinds of services and purchase new goods, from movers or a rental truck to boxes and storage wear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, some people looking for homes may think the housing market is turning and "are in no hurry to pull the trigger on purchases," according to Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist at MFR Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is evidence pricing pressures for new homes are easing. Median sales prices fell 3.5% in September from the prior year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Should that become a trend, and should wage growth continue to strengthen, a revitalized new-home-sales market could occur next year," said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, in the first nine months of this year, sales grew 3.5% when compared with the same time frame in 2017. But the pace of new-home sales remains well below the elevated levels seen before the 2007-09 financial crisis and recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It remains difficult for builders to serve the market, [at] scale, at affordable price points," said Brad Dillman, chief economist at Cortland Partners. "This inability comes despite sizeable deficits in single-family housing today."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home of Tom Reiser in the Heights in Houston. The neighborhood, which had minimal flooding from Hurricane Harvey in 2017, has seen median sales prices for homes rise 8.2% year-to-date compared with the same period a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Reiser, 65, a broker for oil and gas insurance for upstream energy producers, said his decision to build a new house in the Heights was directly tied to its higher elevation than other parts of the city—and so its propensity not to flood.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slumping home sales and rising interest rates are brightening the outlook for apartment and home-rental stocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said sales of existing homes in September fell 3.4% from the previous month and 4.1% from a year earlier. The seventh-consecutive monthly decline was steeper than economists had expected and marks the latest in a string of data points that call into question the housing market's momentum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists and analysts blame rapidly rising home prices that have strained affordability in many cities. The Trump administration's tax bill reduced incentives to own. And mortgage rates rose this month to about 5%, their highest level since the depths of the foreclosure crisis in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts recommend getting out of housing stocks altogether. "The potential downside risks are greater than the upside reward potential," <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> analysts wrote last week in a note to clients suggesting that they move out of real-estate investment trusts and seek refuge in shares of large U.S. companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet other analysts argue that all the gloom hanging over housing is good news for owners of apartments, like <span class="companylink">AvalonBay Communities</span>, which is up 7.4% over the past six months, and <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span>, which has added 5.7% in that time. Rental-home companies have also gained, with <span class="companylink">American Homes 4 Rent</span> climbing 3.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Having pressure on home sales is a positive for the rental side of the industry," David Singelyn, American Homes chief executive, told investors recently. "It should all fare very, very well for pricing power going forward."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The percentage point added over the last year to 30-year mortgage rates adds about $135 to the monthly payment on a $250,000 house financed with a 10% down payment, said John Pawlowski, an analyst at <span class="companylink">Green Street Advisors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not only is the added cost likely to keep some renting longer, $135 is about 8% of the average monthly rent collected by American Homes, suggesting that there is room for these companies to raise rents and remain less expensive than comparable homes for sale, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The insulation for the rental landlord looks pretty good heading into next year," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To that end, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> said last week that about 78% of Americans view renting as more affordable than owning, a rise of 11 percentage points since the mortgage company released similar survey data six months ago. Freddie also said the proportion of respondents who said they have no plans to buy homes also rose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plenty are looking to rent, though. Sean Dobson, CEO of closely held <span class="companylink">Amherst Holdings</span>, said that the last 1,000 houses that the firm's Main Street Renewal unit has listed for rent have elicited about 70,000 inquiries from prospective tenants, or about 70 per property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartment owners too are reporting few problems filling up buildings and retaining tenants.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto and Sharon Nunn </div><div>983 words</div><div>20 October 2018</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2018 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is experiencing its longest slump in four years, as the divergence between a booming U.S. economy and weakening home sales that many had dismissed as temporary now looks poised to continue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A combination of rising mortgage rates and high home prices, a dearth of inventory and a new tax law that reduces incentives for homeownership have weighed on the housing sector this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned U.S. homes fell 3.4% in September from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.15 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Friday. Sales were down 4.1% from a year earlier, the seventh straight month of declines -- marking the longest slump since 2014, when the market was still recovering from the housing crash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Without a doubt there is a clear shift in the market," said Lawrence Yun, the group's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yun blamed a dearth of inventory for weakening sales in recent months. But he also pointed to signs of strong demand, suggesting that could eventually pull the housing market out of the doldrums, if the home supply increased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, even with rising inventory levels in September, Mr. Yun said fewer people were attending open houses. That shows demand could be faltering and that some potential buyers might be giving up, for now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said that rising home prices -- up more than 50% nationwide since prices bottomed out in 2012 -- have been a drag on the housing market. More recently, mortgage rates have been shooting higher, roughly a percentage point this year to nearly 5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Workers' wages are rising again, up nearly 3% over the past year, but not enough to keep up with years of rapid growth in home prices. The monthly payment to buy the average-priced home has risen 16% since the beginning of the year, according to mortgage-data firm <span class="companylink">Black Knight Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affordability is "already more stretched . . . than it has been in previous cycles," said Aaron Terrazas, a senior economist at Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agents say power is shifting more toward buyers. They now have a number of homes to choose from within their budget and feel they need to weigh their options, knowing their home may not appreciate nearly as quickly in the coming years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers have also returned to putting contingencies on their purchases to protect themselves if the home has hidden physical flaws or doesn't appraise at the purchase price -- a practice that was often waived to make offers stand out during bidding wars when the market was hot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home inspections are back," said Joselin Malkhasian, a Realtor in Boston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Phil Morris, a sales executive at Microsoft Corp., moved to Seattle from Oklahoma City last August, "this market was nuts," he said. Mr. Morris, 50 years old, gave up on buying a home and decided to rent instead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few months ago, he noticed that the number of homes on the market was "going way up." A 1950s house in West Seattle with three bedrooms and a big backyard caught his eye. He ultimately bought it at a discount of more than $15,000 from the $605,000 asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That was 100% unheard of" last year, said Mr. Morris's agent, Lindsey Gudger. Sellers have even begun to cover closing costs -- a saving of $5,000 to $7,000 for many buyers -- Mr. Gudger said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is rare for the housing sector to slow so significantly even as the job market and stock market are booming. Gross domestic product grew at a 4.2% rate in the second quarter, the strongest pace in nearly four years. Meanwhile, companies are on a hiring spree and September's 3.7% unemployment rate is the lowest since 1969.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last time the U.S. economy saw such a slump in the housing market was after the so-called taper tantrum in 2013, when then-Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the central bank could start winding down its quantitative-easing program, leading to a spike in interest rates. The housing market slowed in late 2013 through much of 2014, before rebounding strongly as mortgage rates eased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say it is unlikely that the economy and housing market can continue to diverge for much longer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one scenario, economists said continued wage growth could put more money in consumers' pockets and lead to a rebound in sales next spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alternatively, economists say a weakening housing market -- which also helps drive furniture sales, building-materials purchases and construction employment -- could start to drag down the broader economy. Home construction has faltered in recent months as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If this is the first chink in the armor and other parts of the economy start to weaken, driven by increases in rates and consumer confidence starting to wane, then I think it could be the beginning of a really soft year," said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of real-estate brokerage Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of September, the market had a 4.4-month supply of homes, based on the current sales pace, up from a 4.2-month supply a year earlier. That is below what Mr. Yun considers a balanced market of six months of inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median existing-home price in September was $258,100, up 4.2% from a year earlier, according to the Realtors group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">News Corp</span>., owner of The Wall Street Journal, also operates Realtor.com under license from the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of September's weakness was due to Hurricane Florence, which contributed to sales falling 5.4% from a month earlier in the South, according to the Realtors group. But sales were also down by 2.9% in the Northeast and by 3.6% in the West, regions unaffected by the storm.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar edged lower Friday, weighed down by weaker-than-expected U.S. economic data and a renewed appetite for risk among some emerging market investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of 16 others, was recently down 0.2% to 89.90.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned U.S. homes fell 3.4% in September[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-dropped-in-september-1539957950] from the previous month, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Friday, extending a weak stretch for the housing market in a period of otherwise strong U.S. growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shortfalls in U.S. data undercut the case for the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> to keep raising rates at its current pace and tend to weigh on the dollar, which becomes more attractive to foreign investors when borrowing costs rise.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some money managers sought out emerging market currencies Friday, after Chinese officials rushed to reassure investors[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/china-growth-slows-to-6-5-finance-officials-try-to-soothe-worried-investors-1539917129] that the country's economic fundmanetals are solid, despite slowing growth and recent stock market declines.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Katherine Clarke </div><div>934 words</div><div>19 October 2018</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2018 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over a century ago, businessman Mortimer Fleishhacker Sr., purchased a series of parcels about 30 miles south of San Francisco. Like many wealthy locals of the time, he was seeking a summer home removed from the chilly fog of the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That spot is in Woodside, Calif., now one of Silicon Valley's richest neighborhoods where the median home price tops $3.6 million and where Larry Ellison and <span class="companylink">Charles Schwab</span> can live discreetly amongst wooded estates. And now, decades after many other families have already done so, Mr. Fleishhacker's descendants are putting the 74-acre estate named "Green Gables" on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Green Gables is so large and so unusual, its sellers are refusing to set a price, arguing that the property's rarity makes it difficult to know what the market might bear. Listing agent Michael Dreyfus of Golden Gate <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span> does posit that Mr. Fleishhacker's vacation retreat is likely to become the most expensive property ever to trade hands in the notoriously pricey San Francisco Bay Area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current Bay Area record is held by a 9-acre Woodside estate just minutes away. It sold in 2012 for $117 million to SoftBank chief executive Masayoshi Son. The next-largest is the $100 million deal in 2011 by Russia-born billionaire Yuri Milner for 11 acres in nearby Los Altos Hills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S., it is rare for any family to hold on to such a significant property for as long as a century, said Mr. Dreyfus, the listing agent. Other prominent estates built by Bay Area families have been sold and subdivided several times over the years, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Green Gables dates back to between 1907 and 1911, when the area now known as Silicon Valley was a sleepy agglomeration of small towns and fruit orchards. Mr. Fleishhacker Sr., perhaps best known for founding Anglo-California Bank, came from a family whose fortune dated back to the Gold Rush.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to great-grandson Marc Fleishhacker, Mr. Fleishhacker Sr., snapped up 9 parcels of land over several years, and tapped architect Charles Sumner Greene and his brother Henry Mather Greene, who were well-known in the Arts and Crafts movement, to design the main home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fleishhacker Sr., wanted a thatched roof for the main house, so the architects tried to imitate thatch with native redwood shingles that were individually steamed and bent. The house also features sculptural fireplaces, native stone and wood. In the "card room," all the carvings on the furniture match the motifs of wood-blocked stencils on the ceiling. The card room furniture, which includes a square card table and five chairs, is original to the house and may be included in the sale, Marc Fleishhacker said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fleishhacker Sr., died in 1953. Over the years, the family has built other homes on the property for the families of different generations. There are currently seven homes, including one that is used by the estate's manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the property's notable features is a Roman pool the size of a football field, with a Roman water garden and grotto of arches designed to recall an ancient Roman aqueduct. The grounds also include live oaks, giant sequoias, Monterey pines and eucalyptus, as well as a large flower and vegetable garden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marc Fleishhacker, 56, recalled spending months on the property every summer with his siblings and cousins when he was growing up, playing hide and seek and capture the flag. He remembers reenacting "every major Greek battle" on inflatable boats in one of the property's three swimming pools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also learned to drive on the estate's two private roads, and even got into his first motor accident, backing his father's car into a cement pipe. His family still visits every summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marc Fleishhacker said the family is selling because the ownership will likely become too complicated for the next generation, with 18 children set to inherit the property and some of the heirs living outside the Bay Area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TEA AND DAIRY HOUSE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the most unusual features of the estate is a "tea and dairy house," a two-story flagstone building with a black glazed-tile roof. Matriarch Bella Fleishhacker requested the pavilion as a place to serve tea, but the property also became a working dairy house, where dairy maids churned milk and butter and kept milk and cream from the estate's cows. The family would host tea parties of the top floor of the property while the cream and butter was whipped downstairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The listing agent called the structure "fairy-tale-like." The new generation sometimes uses it as a place to meditate or do yoga, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHO WAS MORTIMER FLEISHHACKER?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortimer Fleishhacker, Sr., founded Anglo-California Bank, which ultimately became known as Crocker Bank, which became part of <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>. He also presided over the Great Western Power Company, which built a series of power plants in the California area. The Fleishhacker family is well known throughout California for its philanthropy; a different branch of the family also financed the original Fleishhacker Zoo, which later became the San Francisco Zoo. Mortimer Fleishhacker Jr., founded the public television station KQED. Marc Fleishhacker said he's the first generation not to have been named Mortimer. "I don't know how I got away with that," he joked.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sharon Nunn </div><div>457 words</div><div>17 October 2018</div><div>12:13</div><div>WSJ Pro Central Banking</div><div>RSTPROCB</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2018, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Housing construction fell last month, continuing a weak stretch for the housing market driven by rising borrowing costs and expensive properties that are out of reach for most Americans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building declined 5.3% in September from the prior month, according to the Commerce Department's latest housing report. Building permits, which can signal how much construction is in the pipeline, also fell. That stagnant construction is mirrored in recent readings of home-builder sentiment, which have pulled back throughout this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Builders seem to have taken a cautious stance with sales of new homes easing this year and inventories of unsold homes moving upward," Michael Moran, chief economist at financial services firm Daiwa Capital Markets America, said in a note to clients after the report was released.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though home-price growth has moderated in recent months, it has outpaced wage growth for years. The median new-home sales-price annual growth has bounced between 5% and 10% throughout 2018, whereas hourly wages have grown about 2% to 3% on an annual basis this year. Supply constraints, such as lack of buildable lots and increasing construction material costs, are helping drive up the price of new homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As there are less buyers at each price point, the appropriate market response is a slowdown in sales and an eventual easing in price momentum," said LendingTree Chief Economist Tendayi Kapfidze. "We need affordability to improve for the housing market to regain momentum."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, even as overall economic conditions should support demand, with a rock-solid job market and continued robust GDP growth, mortgage rates have begun to approach 5%, a level that could deter home buyers. A spate of recent economic data has illustrated this conundrum; demand should be strong, but rates and home prices are dampening it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, the broader trend shows continued new-home construction growth, as starts grew by 6.4% in the first nine months of 2018 compared with the same period a year earlier. And this particular data set is volatile from month to month and can be subject to large revisions. September's 5.3% drop for starts came with a margin of error of 11.3 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department's Wednesday report also showed starts declined in September for single-family construction and apartment buildings. Permits last month were down for buildings with five or more units and were up for single-family homes compared with August.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto </div><div>424 words</div><div>17 October 2018</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2018 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than three-quarters of Americans now view renting as more affordable than owning a home, the latest sign that rising mortgage rates and higher home prices will continue to pressure home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some 78% of people now say that renting is more affordable than owning, according to survey data to be released Tuesday by mortgage company <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. That is up 11 percentage points from only six months ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey also indicates that demand for for-sale housing could remain soft in the coming months. Some 58% of renters now say they don't currently have plans to buy a home -- up from 54% in February, according to Freddie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for rentals swelled after the recession, as millions of families lost their homes to foreclosure and tight credit made it difficult for young people to buy homes. Rents rose by double-digit percentages in many cities and the share of families who couldn't afford their rent swelled to records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, home prices plummeted and, for those who could qualify for mortgages, it was a great time to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this year, that dynamic has reversed. Rent growth has slowed in line with inflation in the past few quarters, as new rental supply hits a three-decade high. At the same time, home prices continue to grow significantly faster than incomes and inflation and mortgage rates have risen nearly a percentage point from the beginning of this year. That has made it significantly more expensive to buy a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
David Brickman, president of Freddie Mac and the head of its multifamily division, cautioned that renting remains unaffordable for many families. But buying lately has become even more unaffordable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's the worst of both worlds," Mr. Brickman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two-thirds of renters say they have had difficulty affording their rent at some point in the past two years, according to the Freddie survey. Nearly nine in 10 renters in what Freddie deems "essential" fields like health care and education say they have had significant struggles to pay rent during the past two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brickman cautioned that if more people decide to continue renting that could eventually reverse the current dynamic and make rents once again begin to rise quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I do worry that it may be short-lived, that it's some reaction to rising rates, but the underlying demographic trends are not slowing at all," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market is running out of steam, but its slowdown looks nothing like the historic collapse that took down the whole economy in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price growth has slowed for the last several months and is expected to continue slowing as mortgage rates rise. The volume of existing-home sales has fallen compared with a year earlier for six straight months. In August, the three-month moving average of new single-family homes built was just over 860,000, down from nearly 900,000 at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are a number of reasons to believe this will persist. Mortgage rates have risen about a percentage point in the past year, pinching demand for homes. Rising prices have squeezed affordability. In addition, the tax law passed in December reduced homeownership incentives, foreign buyers have pulled back, and an ample supply of rental apartments has made buying less urgent for many.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The rise in [mortgage] rates paired with this very strong price appreciation absolutely is slowing housing," said Fannie Mae Chief Economist Doug Duncan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news is compared with a decade ago the housing market doesn't have far to fall. As frenzied as the market has felt in recent years, with bidding wars and double-digit price increases, it never came close to the level of the last boom by most measures. That positions it for a much gentler slowdown, economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the last bust, prices fell 25% and single-family housing starts plummeted to just over 430,000 in 2011 from a peak of more than 1.7 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scars from those unusual swings still haven't fully healed, even with a housing recovery in its sixth year. That is giving the current slowdown its own very unusual shape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a typical housing cycle, the forces of rising prices and rising building lead to oversupply, then slowdowns or declines in both. The cycle is driven in part by interest rates -- low rates push prices and building higher and then higher rates drive them down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This cycle is much different in part because building never really took off in this expansion, even though prices recovered in many markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction workers, land developers and home builders left the industry after the last crash, stymieing new-home construction, which remains even now around the same level as in some prior recessions. In addition to labor shortages, higher material costs and increased land-use regulations also held back construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of oversupply, the U.S. has experienced the worst shortage of homes for sale in at least three decades, driving up prices even more and locking first-time buyers out of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some argue that a recession might be good for the housing market because it will slow home-price appreciation and improve affordability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike the last downturn, average home prices don't usually fall nationally, even during recessions. The next slowdown is likely to mark a return to that historical pattern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist at Veritas Urbis, analyzed data from the recessions in the early 1990s, early 2000s and 2007 to 2009 and forecast the likely effect of the next recession on current home-price growth. If the next recession resembles either the bursting of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s or the mild early-1990s recession, home prices will likely stagnate for a year or more but not fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The high end of the housing market, where the majority of new construction did take place, could be more significantly affected, as rising interest rates push buyers toward lower price points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some local markets also are at risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in Dallas grew nearly 10% in August compared with a year earlier, nearly four times the 2.8% increase in August 2005, according to Zillow. Prices in Denver are growing more than 6% compared with just under 3% during the last boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in Seattle have grown about 25% over the past two years. In recent months, Seattle price growth has slowed as the number of homes on the market rose.The number of homes for sale in Seattle was up 50% in August compared with a year ago, according to Redfin, a Seattle-based national brokerage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That could be an example of housing supply catching up with demand. However, in much of the rest of the nation, the two are still out of whack. With interest rates rising and the market undersupplied, getting them realigned won't come smoothly, but it also likely won't lead to a crash.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto and Christina Rexrode </div><div>1131 words</div><div>11 October 2018</div><div>12:35</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2018 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates hit their highest level in more than seven years this week at nearly 5%, a level that could deter many home buyers and represents another setback for the slumping housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to 4.9%—the largest weekly jump in about two years—according to data released Thursday by mortgage-finance giant <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders and real-estate agents say that, even now, all but the most qualified buyers making large down payments face borrowing rates of 5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates have been edging higher in recent months, but during "the last week we've seen an explosion higher in mortgage rates," said Rodney Anderson, a mortgage lender in the Dallas area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 5% mortgage rate isn't that high by historic standards. During much of the decade before the financial crisis, these rates hovered between 5% and 7%. But a return to more normal lending rates won't feel normal to many buyers who have become accustomed to getting a mortgage loan at 4% or lower, and they could experience sticker shock at what they would have to pay now for a home loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's almost a generation that has been used to seeing 3% or 4% rates that's now seeing 5% rates," said Vishal Garg, founder and chief executive of Better Mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a house with a $250,000 mortgage, rates of 5% add about $150 to the monthly payments compared with the rate of 4% that borrowers could have had less than a year ago, according to <span class="companylink">LendingTree Inc</span>., an online loan information site. That excludes taxes and insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With rates hitting recent highs at a time when housing prices have been going up, too, some economists suggest sellers may need to lower prices if borrowers can't afford high prices in a higher rate environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher mortgage rates have also slowed the housing market more than many expected. That's a potentially troubling sign for the broader economy, since housing is often a bellwether [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/banks-brace-for-the-downside-of-higher-rates-1538823600]for how rising interest rates could affect growth overall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many buyers who are struggling to find a home they can afford because of high prices are more sensitive to rising rates than they have been in the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Existing home sales fell in August [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-steadied-in-august-1537452421]from a year earlier, the sixth straight month of declines. Many would-be buyers sat out the buying season because of high housing prices, a historic shortage of homes to buy[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/american-housing-shortage-slams-the-door-on-buyers-1521395460], and a tax bill that reduced some incentives for homeownership. Higher mortgage rates will likely compound their hesitation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With the escalation of prices, it could be that borrowers are running out of breath," said Sam Khater, chief economist at Freddie Mac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once-hot markets are showing signs of cooling down. Bill Nelson, president of Your Home Free, a Dallas-based real-estate brokerage, said that in the neighborhoods where he works, the number of homes experiencing price cuts is more than double the number that are going into contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brad and Virginia Reitinger closed on a new home in Dallas two weeks ago, and opted for an adjustable-rate mortgage so they could get a 4% rate. With a fixed-rate 30-year loan, they would have had to pay 4.5% to 5%, Mr. Reitinger said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added that the prospect of rates going even higher motivated them to move quickly on buying the new home. And if they had opted for a fixed-rate mortgage, he estimates, their monthly payment would have been higher by a couple hundred dollars. "When you run the numbers, it makes a big difference," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adjustable-rate mortgages, which reset to market rates after a certain number of years, typically offer lower rates than fixed-rate mortgages at the beginning of their term. Some lenders say they have seen a surge of customer inquiries into the product as rates rise. They remain a relatively small part of the mortgage market, though: They made up about 12% of mortgage originations in the second quarter, according to industry research group Inside Mortgage Finance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in rates could have far-reaching effects for the mortgage industry. Some lenders—particularly nonbanks that don't have [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/the-new-mortgage-kings-theyre-not-banks-1536242400]other lines of business —could take on riskier customers to keep up their level of loan volume, or be forced to sell themselves. Many U.S. mortgage lenders, including some of the biggest players, didn't exist a decade ago and only know a low-rate environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long-term mortgage rates now have climbed nearly a full percentage point from 3.95% at the beginning of this year. House hunters who started searching months ago are acutely aware of the rise in rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have some people who prepared themselves early, and bless their heart for doing it—that's what I've been preaching," said Rick Bechtel, head of U.S. mortgage banking at TD Bank. "And they're the ones who are most pained."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A spate of recent positive economic news [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-government-bonds-fall-following-upbeat-jobs-data-1538576263]helped drive the 10-year Treasury note, to which mortgage rates are closely tied, to a seven-year high last week. The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>, which has raised its key policy rate three times this year, is expected to do so again in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And higher rates will likely kill off any lingering possibility of a refinancing boom[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/homeowners-ditch-refinancings-as-mortgage-rates-rise-1522062001], which bailed out the mortgage industry in the years right after the 2008 financial crisis. If rates hit 5%, the pool of homeowners who would qualify for and benefit from a refinance will shrink to 1.55 million, according to mortgage-data and technology firm <span class="companylink">Black Knight Inc</span>. That would be down about 64% since the start of the year, and the smallest pool since 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher rates will be hardest on first-time buyers, who tend to make smaller down payments than older buyers who have built up equity in their previous homes, and middle-income buyers, who can least afford the extra cost. Mr. Khater said that about 45% of the loans that <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> is backing are to first-time buyers, up from about 30% normally, which also means that rising rates could have an even bigger impact on the market than usual.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Affordability has already been an issue for consumers across the country," said Sanjiv Das, CEO of Caliber Home Loans Inc., one of the biggest mortgage lenders in the country. "Now it becomes an even bigger issue."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Russell Gold </div><div>481 words</div><div>30 September 2018</div><div>18:23</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2018 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Husky Energy Inc</span>. said it has made an unsolicited bid to acquire oil-sands producer MEG Energy Corp. in what would be a combination of Canadian petroleum companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calgary-based Husky said it was proposing to purchase MEG for 3.3 billion Canadian dollars (US$2.6 billion) in a cash-and-stock deal. Husky also will assume MEG's debt, which is about C$3.1 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
John Rogers, MEG's vice president of investor relations, said the management and board of directors was examining the bid "to determine whether it is in the best interest of shareholders."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the board and shareholders accept Husky's bid, the combined companies would have a large set of oil production, pipelines and refineries in western Canada's oil sands, a region where viscous oil is abundant but expensive to produce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MEG produces about 100,000 barrels a day of oil, mostly from a process of pumping steam into the underground oil formations to heat it and make it more of a liquid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Husky operates refineries in Canada and the U.S., as well as offshore oil exploration and production in China, Indonesia and Canada. Husky produces about 186,000 barrels a day in western Canada and the oil and natural gas equivalent of 322,900 barrels a day globally, according to Husky's annual report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Robert Peabody, Husky's chief executive, said he approached MEG several months ago and made a formal offer in the summer, but that he was rebuffed. He said in an interview he didn't know why MEG rejected the earlier offer. "They didn't get into it," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Peabody said Husky planned to refinance MEG's debt at a lower rate, generating savings for the companies. He also said Husky could get a better price for MEG's oil. Oil from western Canada trades at a large discount to benchmark West Texas intermediate oil because producers in Canada's oil patch have a difficult time getting their crude to refiners. Husky owns pipelines to move the crude and upgraders to convert the Canadian crude into higher-quality, more-sought-after oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're well equipped to deal with the issue," said Mr. Peabody.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MEG was founded in 1999 to focus on the steam-assisted gravity drainage method of oil production and acquired several leases in Canada's Alberta province. <span class="companylink">Highfields Capital Management LP</span> owns a 9.9% stake in the company, said Mr. Rogers. A representative of Highfields joined the board at the end of 2017 and resigned over the summer.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Martin Feldstein </div><div>879 words</div><div>28 September 2018</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A15</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2018 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ten years after the Great Recession's onset, another long, deep downturn may soon roil the U.S. economy. The high level of asset prices today mirrors the earlier trend in house prices that preceded the 2008 crash; both mispricings reflect long periods of very low real interest rates caused by <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> policy. Now that interest rates are rising, equity prices will fall, dragging down household wealth, consumer spending and economic activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the five-year period before the last downturn, the Fed had decreased the federal-funds rate to as low as 1%. That drove down mortgage interest rates, causing home prices to rise faster than 10% a year. When the Fed raised rates after 2004, the housing-price bubble burst within two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As housing prices plummeted, homeowners with highly leveraged mortgages found themselves owing substantially more than their homes were worth. They defaulted in droves, causing lenders to foreclose on their properties. Sales of the foreclosed properties forced prices even lower, leading the national house-price index to decline 30% in three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks that held mortgages and mortgage-backed bonds saw their net worths decline sharply. A total of 140 U.S. banks failed in 2009, and those that survived were terrified by how much further the market might slide. To avoid risky bets, they shied away from lending to businesses and home buyers and refused to lend to other banks whose balance sheets were also declining.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fall in home prices from 2006-09 cut household wealth by $6 trillion. Coinciding with a stock-market crash, the erased wealth caused consumer spending to drop sharply, pushing the economy into recession. The collapse of bank lending deepened the decline and slowed the recovery to a sluggish pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fast forward to today. Homes aren't as overvalued as they were in 2006, so there's little chance of an exact replay of the 2008 crisis. The principal risk now is that a stock-market slowdown could shrink consumer spending enough to push the economy into recession. Share prices are high today because long-term interest rates are extremely low. Today the interest rate on 10-year Treasury notes is less than 3%, meaning the inflation-adjusted yield on those bonds is close to zero. The hunt for higher yields drives investors toward equities -- driving up share prices in the process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But long-term rates are beginning to rise and are likely to increase substantially in the near future. Though the 3% yield on 10-year Treasurys is still low, it's still twice as high as it was two years ago. It will be pushed higher as the Fed raises the short-term rate from today's 2% to its projected 3.4% in 2020. Rising inflation will further increase the long-term interest rate as investors demand compensation for their loss of purchasing power. And as annual federal spending deficits explode over the coming decade, it will take ever-higher long-term interest rates to get bond buyers to absorb the debt. It wouldn't be surprising to see the yield on 10-year Treasurys exceed 5%, with the resulting real yield rising from zero today to more than 2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As short- and long-term interest rates normalize, equity prices are also likely to return to historic price-to-earnings ratios. If the P/E ratio of the S&amp;P 500 regresses to its historical average, 40% below today's level, $10 trillion of household wealth would be wiped out. The past relationship between household wealth and consumer spending suggests such a decline would reduce annual spending by about $400 billion, shrinking gross domestic product by 2%. Add in the effects on business investment, and this spending crunch would push the economy into recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most recessions are short and shallow, with an average of less than a year between the start of the downturn and the beginning of the recovery. That's because the Fed usually responds to recessions by cutting the federal-funds rate substantially. But if one hits in the next few years, the Fed will not have enough room to cut rates, as the fed-funds rate is expected to rise to only 3% by 2020. There also won't be much room for a major fiscal intervention. Federal deficits are expected to exceed $1 trillion annually in the coming years, and publicly held federal debt is predicted to rise from 75% of GDP to nearly 100% by the decade's end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This means a downturn brought on in the next few years by rising long-term interest rates would likely be deeper and longer than your average recession. Unfortunately, there's nothing at this point that the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> or any other government actor can do to prevent that from happening.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—The number of U.S. existing homes going under contract declined in August for the fourth time in five months, reflecting what appears to be a broader slowdown in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> on Thursday said its pending home-sales index, which tracks contract signings for purchases of previously owned homes, fell 1.8% from the prior month to 104.2 in August. Sales, unless they fall through, typically close within a month or two of signing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a 0.4% decline in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index was down 2.3% in August from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With prices having risen so quickly, many consumers were deciding to wait to list their homes hoping to see additional price and equity gains," said Lawrence Yun, the trade group's chief economist. "However, with indications that buyers are beginning to pull out, price gains are going to decelerate and potential sellers are considering that now is a good time to list and bring more properties to the market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More widely, housing-market inventory has been tight, driving up home prices and pricing some potential buyers out of the market. At the same time, skilled construction labor shortages, higher input costs and rising mortgage rates are also making the overall cost of buying a home more expensive. Sales of previously owned homes stalled in August, highlighting a growing disconnect between the sluggish housing market and robust economic growth.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal regulators approved a plan to speed deployment of next-generation 5G wireless networks around the U.S. by overriding some local rules that could delay the process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supporters say Wednesday's vote by the <span class="companylink">Federal Communications Commission</span> boosts U.S. chances of taking the lead in 5G technology, and could help accelerate deployment in harder-to-serve rural areas. The action cuts local red tape around permitting for small cells, the backpack-sized wireless devices that will be a key part of 5G infrastructure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Today's order streamlines the approval process for 5G small cells and helps ensure that our country will continue to be the innovation hub of the world," said Brendan Carr, the Republican FCC commissioner who developed the order.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The order limits fees that regulators can charge for reviewing small cells, sets time limits for applications that are under review, and affirms that local governments can apply reasonable aesthetic considerations.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price gains slowed for the fourth straight month in July, as higher mortgage rates begin acting as a brake on rapid price growth, offering some respite for buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which measures average home prices in major metropolitan areas across the nation, rose 6% in July compared with a year earlier, down from a 6.2% year-over-year increase in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price gains accelerated for most of the past two years, growing significantly faster than both incomes and inflation. But in recent months price growth has begun to taper, as interest rates have risen and inventory in some markets has been growing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The slowing in the market is widespread,"said David Blitzer, managing director at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller 10-city index gained 5.5% over the year, down from 6% in June. The 20-city index increased 5.9%, also down half a percentage point from 6.4% the previous month. Fifteen out of 20 cities saw smaller increases in July than a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas had the fastest home-price growth in the country for the second straight month, at 13.7%. Seattle, which dropped to second place in recent months, saw prices grow 12.1% in the year ended in July. Buoyed by a strong tech economy, San Francisco's already high home prices grew 10.8% in July from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than five years of rapidly rising prices, combined with higher mortgage rates are making homes less affordable. Rates have climbed back near the seven-year high they hit in May, with rates for a 30-year mortgage averaging 4.65% last week <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A paper released by the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> shows a drop in the affordability index, which measures the share of homes that households can afford with a typical down payment. A household making the median income could afford 62% of homes on the market in the second quarter, down from 64% in the prior quarter and the three-decade high of 79% of homes in late 2012.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto and Sharon Nunn </div><div>618 words</div><div>21 September 2018</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2018 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home sales stalled in August, highlighting a growing disconnect between the sluggish housing market and the strong economy that is powering stocks to new highs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales fell in August from a year earlier, the sixth straight month of declines. Sales of previously owned homes fell 1.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.34 million homes, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> reported Thursday. Sales were flat compared with July's pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said that low inventory, rising home prices and higher mortgage rates continue to pressure the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lackluster home sales stand in sharp contrast to the booming stock market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500 both hit records Thursday as expectations of strong corporate profits and continued economic growth offset lingering investor concerns about the trade dispute between the U.S. and China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A strong economy typically boosts demand for housing, too, putting more money in consumers' pockets and giving them confidence to make what for many will be the largest purchase of their lives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet 78 straight months of annual home price gains coupled with rising mortgage rates have made homes less affordable. That has prompted some would-be first-time buyers to continue renting, and made existing owners reluctant to sell if it means trading up for a much more expensive home at a higher mortgage rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Consumer confidence may be near record levels, but no one appears confident enough to sell their home either to trade up to something bigger for a growing family or to downsize as the baby-boom generation hits retirement age," said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sale price for an existing home in August was $264,800, up 4.6% from a year earlier. Meanwhile, mortgage rates climbed back near the seven-year high they hit in May, with rates for a 30-year mortgage now averaging 4.65% this week, up from 4.6% a week earlier, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upper end of the housing market -- where many buyers have benefited from the stock market's gains -- remains strong, with nearly 12% growth in single-family home sales over $1 million and nearly 9% growth in sales from $750,000 to $1 million. In contrast, sales of single-family homes priced below $100,000 fell about 12%, and sales from $100,000 to $250,000 fell roughly 2%, according to <span class="companylink">NAR</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Lawrence Yun, the trade group's chief economist, said the strongest demand their realtors are indicating is "in the lower price points, but sales are down because of lack of inventory."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists have blamed a lack of inventory for the slowing market, but growing inventory levels and moderating price gains suggest demand is also tapering. The supply of existing homes in the U.S. increased 2.7% in August from a year earlier, the first rise in inventory on an annual basis in more than three years, according to <span class="companylink">NAR</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pricier markets on the West Coast have seen even more dramatic growth in supply. In Seattle, inventory grew 30% in August from a year earlier, while Portland, Los Angeles and the Bay Area have all also seen near-double-digit increases in inventory, according to Ruben Gonzalez, chief economist for real-estate brokerage Keller Williams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">NAR</span>'s Mr. Yun said the moderating prices and increase in supply are healthy developments for the market because they could help lure buyers back from the sidelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gonzalez said inventory has increased but still not enough to boost sales.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. housing starts grew modestly last month, driven by an outsize jump in apartment building that masked weakness in the pipeline for single- and multifamily construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts increased 9.2% in August from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.282 million, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits, a more stable measure that can signal how much construction is in the pipeline, were down for multifamily building, a sign that demand continues to cool for apartments and condominiums.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the church has had a plan for dealing with complaints against priests since 2002, there was previously no formal method to address complaints against bishops, who oversaw that process. Now the church will establish a new system, run by a third party, for people to confidentially report misconduct by bishops, the administrative committee of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The complaints will be directed "to the appropriate ecclesiastical authority and, as required by applicable law, to civil authorities," the committee said. In addition, the committee is beginning to develop a "code of conduct" regarding sexual abuse and harassment by bishops or negligence of duties in dealing with such issues.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. housing starts grew modestly last month, driven by an outsize jump in apartment building that masked weakness in the pipeline for single- and multifamily construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts increased 9.2% in August from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.282 million, the Commerce Department said Wednesday [https://www-census-gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf]. This rise in building was driven by a robust 29.3% climb in the volatile multifamily sector that likely won't be sustained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits, a more stable measure that can signal how much construction is in the pipeline, were down for multifamily building, a sign that demand continues to cool for apartments and condominiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Permits were also sluggish for the single-family sector, even as steady job and wage growth are helping drive home-buyer demand. Rising material costs and labor shortages are posing challenges for builders seeking to ramp up construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Builders know that there is demand at a lower price point," said Aaron Terrazas, senior economist at Zillow. "They can't meet that price point given all the costs."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing-starts data are volatile from month to month and can be subject to large revisions. August's rise for starts carried a margin of error of 11.4 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The broader trend shows the housing market notching some pickup, as starts climbed by 6.9% in the first eight months of 2018 compared with the same period a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, would-be buyers are also dealing with rising prices and borrowing costs, deterrents to home buying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is fundamental softness in housing," wrote Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities, in a note to clients. "Even if the weather had been more favorable in recent months, housing activity would probably not have been much better than flat after advancing at a substantial pace in prior years."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> on Tuesday said its gauge of builder confidence remained unchanged in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, he said labor costs and affordability are going to become an increasing challenge to the industry. He expects housing to become an issue in the coming midterm elections and the presidential election in 2020.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Josh Barbanel </div><div>721 words</div><div>19 September 2018</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A12A</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2018 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A decade after the financial panic of 2008, housing prices in New York City have bounced back and recently edged above peak pre-crisis levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An analysis of long-term sales trends by StreetEasy.com found that sale prices for houses and apartments across the city are 2% above peak levels in November 2006, and 28.5% above the low point in November 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It put the median resale price of an apartment or home across the five boroughs, from tony Fifth Avenue co-ops to small frame houses in neighborhoods hard hit by foreclosures such as Jamaica, Queens, at $656,188 in July, exceeding the 2006 peak of $643,255 in January 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who bought and sold a New York City house or apartment after September 2008, when the bankruptcy filing by <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> set off a financial panic, realized outsize gains, the report found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those sellers scored gains of 33%, or 7.5% a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four out of five of these sellers saw gains of at least 10% -- enough to break even and cover transfer taxes, brokerage fees and other closing costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only half of those who bought in the two years before the financial-services firm's bankruptcy and later sold saw such a gain on their sale after closing costs, the report found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Manhattan's luxury market beat to a different drum, overall sale prices in New York City reported by StreetEasy closely tracked the pattern across the country, where the housing market collapsed as years of lax lending standards gave way to tightening credit, and stagnating incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, overall New York City housing prices reached a 2006 peak about four months after those in the rest of the country and hit bottom about four months earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York City, with its concentration of banks and financial-services firms, was hard hit by the financial crisis. But the city also bounced back faster than other parts of the U.S., as the economy and employment grew at a faster pace than the country as a whole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan, with its many wealthy residents, international buyers and luxury housing, was less dependent on credit conditions. There precrisis prices peaked much later, in spring 2008. After a freeze in luxury sales, prices pushed above that level by 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The credit crisis that came along with the financial crisis definitely hit the other boroughs more than it hit Manhattan," said Grant Long, StreetEasy's senior economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The value of all residential transactions in New York City exceeded the $42.7 billion spent in 2006 only in 2016, according to data compiled by the <span class="companylink">Real Estate Board of New York</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Manhattan, the $20.2 billion spent in 2008 was surpassed by 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The StreetEasy report raised a question about the investment value of a home purchase, especially when compared with the outsize gains of the stock market in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the housing market in the city bottomed out in 2011, the S&amp;P 500 index has risen 125%, compared with a gain of nearly 30% in housing prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Even for those who did manage to time the market well, the numbers are less attractive when compared with other investments," the StreetEasy report said. "New York City real estate dramatically underperformed the stock market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report cited the profitable sale of a large studio at 88 Greenwich St., a 1929 art deco building that was converted to a condominium in 2007. It was purchased from the sponsor in 2010 near the bottom of the market for $490,000 and sold five years later for $655,000 for 34% gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast, another studio in a co-op at 244 Madison Ave. near East 38th Street in Midtown Manhattan was purchased in 2007 for $575,000 and sold in 2014 for $635,000, a gain of 10%, which works out to a 1.3% annual return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, prices are showing signs of weakening in Manhattan and Brooklyn. "A cycle of swift growth in New York home prices seems to be coming to an end," the StreetEasy report said, citing a surge of inventory that is likely to increase this year.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will yesterday's rescue be tomorrow's risk?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. stock market is now 10 years removed from the financial crisis, which sparked a deep recession, resulted in millions of people losing their jobs and homes, and decimated the stock market, with the S&amp;P 500 losing more than half its value. Massive steps were taken by governments and central banks across the world to stop the crisis, but in what could become an ironic outcome, those measures may have simply laid the foundation for the next crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's according to <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span>, which analyzed the causes of, and response to, the crisis in a recent note. According to the investment bank, the economy remains propped up by the extraordinary steps taken in 2008, and changes to this environment—which have already begun, and which will accelerate next year—are an underappreciated risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A primary step taken during the financial crisis was massive monetary stimulus, including both the Troubled Asset Relief Program—where the government bought toxic assets from weakened financial institutions—and quantitative easing, where the Federal Reserve bought government bonds in order to lower interest rates and spur more investments and make equities more attractive. Overall, central banks bought some $10 trillion in assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This accommodation is now expected to reverse, starting meaningfully in 2019. Such outflows (or lack of new inflows) could lead to asset declines and liquidity disruptions, and potentially cause a financial crisis," <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> wrote. "The main attribute of the next crisis will be severe liquidity disruptions resulting from these market developments since the last crisis."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Changes to central bank policy are widely seen as a risk to stocks, which by one measure have been in the longest bull market in history since the bottom of the crisis. Barry Bannister, head of institutional equity strategy at Stifel, recently wrote that stocks were in "the danger zone," and that rising interest rates could spark a bear market with "stocks falling faster than the Fed can react."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Fed has been reducing the size of its balance sheet, which swelled to nearly $4.5 trillion with the various rounds of quantitative easing. The unwinding of the balance sheet is seen as removing a steady drumbeat of equity support from Wall Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> referred to its hypothetical scenario as the "great liquidity crisis," and said that the timing of when it could occur "will largely be determined by the pace of central bank normalization, business cycle dynamics, and various idiosyncratic events such as escalation of trade war waged by the current U.S. administration," the report read.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Changes to monetary policy will also have implications for the bond market. Since hitting a record-low below 1.4% in July 2016, the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note has climbed to 2.97%. That means that bond prices have dropped, as prices and yields move inversely to each other. If June 2016 does mark a turning point for the bond bull market, that could have significant implications for risk across asset classes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Over the past two decades, most risk models were (correctly) counting on bonds to offset equity risk. At the turning point of monetary accommodation, this assumption will most likely fail. This increases tail risk for multiasset portfolios," <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> wrote. "In the next crisis, bonds likely will not be able to offset equity losses (due to low rates and already large CB balance sheets)."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, Jeffrey Kleintop, the chief global investment strategist at <span class="companylink">Charles Schwab</span>, warned that global levels of debt could exacerbate the severity of the next financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Citing data from the <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span>, he wrote that global debt stood at $164 trillion at the end of 2016, the most recent period for which data are available. That represents 225% of global GDP, and growth of $50 trillion from pre-financial-crisis levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While a high debt burden isn't necessarily a problem by itself, it increases the vulnerability of the system to a shock—in particular, a shock that would lift interest rates," Mr. Kleintop wrote. "In theory, all that debt means the potential losses from a rise in interest rates would be more costly than in the past, especially combined with a stronger dollar pushing up the cost of dollar-denominated debt outside the United States."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> didn't forecast a crisis in the near term, saying that current imbalances in the U.S. economy were "ample but not glaring," and that "the lack of severe imbalances suggests the next recession will be less likely to trigger a 2008-style crisis." The most likely recession scenario, it added, "seems milder than 2008 and more akin to 1990 or 2001."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, it models a 25% chance of a recession starting in the next year, "not far from the historical average of 17%."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most home buyers across the country finance their purchases with a mortgage. In Detroit, though, the vast majority pay cash, even as home prices in the city are rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low housing prices, affluent buyers, challenges with appraisals and strong interest from investors hoping to make gains on a revived Detroit are making cash deals more common. An eye-popping 87% of all single-family home and condominium buyers in the first half of 2018 paid cash in the city, compared with 28% nationwide, according to Irvine, Calif.-based housing-research firm ATTOM Data Solutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The City of Detroit has an absurdly low share of financed home purchases relative to the nation and even relative to the greater Detroit metro area," says Daren Blomquist, ATTOM senior vice president. In the Detroit metropolitan statistical area, which includes outlying suburban areas, just under 40% of buyers paid cash during the first half of 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many city buyers are paying cash simply because home prices are so low in Detroit. The median price of a home in the city was just $32,428 in the first six months of 2018. That's an increase of 20% over the year-earlier period, but still well below the national median of $234,000, according to ATTOM Data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many investors are buying, renovating and flipping distressed homes -- some as large as 4,200 square feet and with architectural significance -- in Detroit's downtown area and historic neighborhoods, says Kyle Swink, a real-estate agent with <span class="companylink">Coldwell Banker</span> Weir Manuel in Birmingham, Mich., who lives in Detroit. It can be difficult to get mortgage financing on properties in such bad condition, so those investors often pay cash, Mr. Swink says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People looking to buy those renovated homes -- often affluent young professionals or empty-nesters -- may also face challenges in getting a mortgage because those properties are difficult to appraise. Lenders have trouble determining the value of a newly renovated home in a neighborhood otherwise filled with distressed properties because there are few comparable sales to benchmark against.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You may be the first one with a resale in a particular neighborhood, so there may not be very much to compare to, making it difficult for appraisers to find tangible evidence of value," says Jonathan Miller, an appraiser and president of Miller Samuel Inc. in New York. So those buyers often end up paying cash too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some companies with local roots are trying to change that dynamic. Detroit-based Quicken Loans is collaborating with <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> and the Detroit Land Bank Authority, a public authority working on returning Detroit's vacant, abandoned and foreclosed property to productive use. Under the "Rehabbed and Ready" program, the Authority selects properties in its inventory for <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> to rehab, Quicken preapproves interested buyers for mortgage financing and the homes are sold. The ultimate goal is to stabilize the market and create comparable sales to help future buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Tax foreclosure is a force that has generated blight, increased speculation and driven property values down," says Laura Grannemann, vice president of strategic investments at the Quicken Loans Community Fund. "But by creating strategically placed sales, it has a ripple effect across the community and allows other individuals to refinance their home and get some equity out or to sell that home and buy a new one."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ATLANTA -- Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms recently delivered an odd message for a leader of a city whose name has become synonymous with growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I told them, 'If you live on the Westside of Atlanta, do not sell your property right now,'" she said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Bottoms's advice was aimed at working-class homeowners in a predominantly African-American area that she said is gentrifying so quickly people are getting shortchanged for their property. Atlanta, the economic capital of the Deep South, has promoted growth for decades and now finds itself trying to figure out how to manage neighborhoods quickly morphing from poor and working-class to redeveloped and wealthier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The good news is that we have all this development," said Ms. Bottoms, who took office in January. "The flip side of that is people are getting pushed out."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlanta is economically booming and facing a worker shortage. Ensuring that older people stay in their homes and that schoolteachers, police officers and firefighters can afford to live in the city is "an ongoing challenge," the mayor said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gentrification debate in Atlanta has been focused to a large extent on the BeltLine, Atlanta's trail project that follows rail corridors in a 22-mile loop around the city. In 2012, the first portion of the Eastside Trail opened, spawning new condos and apartment buildings, restaurants and stores. Last fall after three years of construction, a section of the trail opened on the Westside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The BeltLine is funded by government agencies, nonprofit donors and a tax-allocation district, in which a portion of taxes collected in the area are designated for area improvements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many cities across the U.S. have developed or are considering similar path projects. New York's 1.45-mile High Line has drawn new housing, businesses and tourists, as have bike and walking paths in New Orleans, Chicago and Philadelphia. Many of these cities are also wrestling with how to manage growth while maintaining affordable housing for service workers and others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlanta announced Aug. 6 it had purchased another 1.8 miles of former railroad corridor on the Westside for $6.3 million, and now owns 80% of the land needed for the BeltLine project, which it aims to complete by 2030.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlanta BeltLine Inc. has been criticized for its lack of attention to affordable housing. Chief Executive Paul Morris was ousted in 2017 following such criticism. The next CEO, Brian McGowan, refocused efforts on affordable housing, but he left in mid-August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interim CEO Clyde Higgs said the BeltLine is "absolutely behind" on affordable housing. Mr. Higgs said he is in talks with nonprofits, corporations and others about fixing the problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before he left his post, Mr. McGowan said the area around the BeltLine should have about 10,000 units of affordable housing by 2030. The area currently has about 2,600 such units. Affordable housing in the city is defined as rental units for people earning no more than 80% of the area's median income, or no more than $1,047 a month for a single person.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the two ZIP Codes that cover most of the Westside's West End area, median prices for single-family homes and condos rose 54% and 110%, respectively, from the first quarter of 2014 to the first quarter of 2018, according to property-data provider Attom Data Solutions. Median home prices rose about 49% in metro Atlanta as a whole during the period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The BeltLine set a goal of creating 30,000 permanent jobs in the area around the BeltLine by 2030. So far, the organization estimates it has created 11,200.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Bottoms made preserving affordable housing a central platform of her campaign. She said she hoped to secure $1 billion in public and private funding to help preserve and build affordable housing. Since January, city agencies and related nonprofits have provided about $50 million in incentives and programs, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amichi Bertrand, a 32-year-old African-American, said the neighborhood he knew is disappearing and he doesn't trust the talk about creating sustained affordable housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Whatever the vision is for the neighborhood, it ain't mine," he said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON--The number of homes across the U.S. that went under contract fell in July and have now declined on an annual basis for seven consecutive months, adding to the evidence that the housing market is cooling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors' pending home sales index, which tracks signings for purchases of previously owned homes, decreased 0.7% from a month earlier to 106.2, the trade group said Wednesday. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected sales to remain flat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The July index is down 2.3% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The reason sales are falling off last year's pace is that multiple years of inadequate supply in markets with strong job growth have finally driven up home prices to a point where an increasing number of prospective buyers are unable to afford it," said Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index offers a timely but imprecise look at the housing market because it measures sales at the earliest stage of the often weeks-long purchasing process--when contracts are signed, but before the final step, known as closing. Some contracts are canceled before closing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other housing reports show that rising home prices and higher mortgage rates are locking many potential buyers out of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR's more closely watched measure, existing-home sales, declined for the fourth straight month in July, the trade group said last week. Existing-home sales represent closings on previously owned U.S. homes.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Aaron Back </div><div>432 words</div><div>29 August 2018</div><div>11:02</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2018 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks already contending with sputtering loan growth won't get much help from mortgages as the U.S. housing market shows signs of cooling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evidence is stacking up that residential real estate has at least hit a soft patch. Last week, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> reported that seasonally adjusted existing-home sales declined for the fourth consecutive month[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/existing-home-sales-fell-for-fourth-straight-month-in-july-1534946765] in July, a drop of 0.7%. The decline was particularly steep in the northeast at 8.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week the S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index showed home-price appreciation slowed[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-home-price-gains-decelerate-1535462545] to 6.2% from a year earlier in June, down from 6.4% in July. Weakness again was concentrated in the northeast. New York was the only one of the 20 major cities tracked to see a fall in prices from a month earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These figures are far from dire. Aaron Terrazas, senior economist at <span class="companylink">Zillow Group</span>, says the housing market is being supported by a strong national economy, particularly in rural areas and smaller cities. At the same time, stretched affordability after years of price gains, and the reduced deduction for state and local taxes, are weighing on certain markets, especially in high-cost coastal areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Right now these forces are balancing each other," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, the gradual increase in interest rates over the past year hasn't been enough to derail the market, but it certainly isn't helping. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to 4.78% in the week through Aug. 24, up 0.67 percentage point from a year earlier, according to the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bottom line is that, while house prices are remaining relatively firm, housing sales, and therefore mortgage volumes, aren't faring as well. Data from the MBA shows that total mortgage purchase applications for the week through Aug. 24 fell 8.6% from four weeks earlier and were up just 2.9% from a year earlier. Mortgage refinancing applications were a third lower than a year ago. Overall mortgage applications are down 15% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This comes as commercial and industrial loans, having posted a mild rebound in the spring, are now leveling off[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/regional-banks-still-need-a-lending-boost-1535292000], partly due to uncertainty over trade policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is increasingly hard to see where the next leg of growth will come from for U.S. banks.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto </div><div>661 words</div><div>29 August 2018</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2018 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price growth slowed in June for the third straight month, welcome news for buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising interest rates, along with elevated prices resulting from a lack of inventory, are putting the brakes on price increases after gains had grown significantly faster than both incomes and inflation for most of the past two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which measures average home prices in major metropolitan areas across the nation, rose 6.2% in June, down from the 6.4% year-over-year increase reported for May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've been running faster than we should be able to sustain for quite some time," said David Blitzer, managing director at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Blitzer said that, over the next year or so, price gains are likely to ease until they are more in line with wages and inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller 10-city index gained 6% over the year, down from 6.2% the prior month. The 20-city index gained 6.3%, down from 6.5% the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has been slowing in recent months, a result of rising mortgage rates, a lack of inventory and a run-up in prices that has strained affordability. Existing-home sales have declined for four straight months, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said last week. Sales of new homes declined for the second straight month in July, the Commerce Department said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, even with the slowdown in price increases, gains are still roughly twice their long-term average. "It may just be that the prices take a bit of time to catch up with the rest of" the market slowdown, Mr. Blitzer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seattle, which has seen the fastest home-price growth in the country for nearly two years, dropped to second place in June. Prices grew 12.8% in the year ended in June. Seattle realtors have reported rising inventory levels and homes sitting on the market for weeks as buyers take their time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas, where home prices increased 13% in June compared with a year earlier, now has the fastest-growing home prices in the country. That is a potentially worrying indicator, given that housing market's tendency to overheat. But this time the boom appears to be built on a more solid foundation, as Las Vegas is now also one of the fastest-growing markets in the country in terms of both jobs and population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Case-Shiller's index focuses on larger, and primarily pricier, urban areas. Zillow Senior <span class="companylink">Economist</span> Aaron Terrazas said Zillow's data show gains slowing in pricier markets such as Seattle, Denver and Los Angeles but continuing to accelerate or hold steady in less expensive markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price increases appear primarily to be squeezing middle- and upper-middle-class buyers, with the wealthiest Americans continuing to spend more to buy homes. <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> saw a 30% increase in profit in the quarter ended July 31, with customers spending $165,000 on average toward premium customization and design features.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rise in mortgage rates has contributed to a slowdown in sales in recent months. The average rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage fell to 4.51% last week from 4.53% a week earlier -- hitting the lowest level since mid-April, according to data released Thursday by <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. Nonetheless, the rate for a 30-year mortgage a year ago was 3.86%, near historic lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tian Liu, chief economist at Genworth Mortgage Insurance, said buyers have been digesting the increase in rates but a slowdown in price increases could help draw people back in, creating new momentum in the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The reason we think it's going to be a deceleration rather than an outright decline is you still have many buyers that are looking to get into the market," he said.</p>

Warren Buffett Slashes Price on Longtime Beach House; The billionaire investor now asks $7.9 million for the Laguna Beach, Calif., home where he used to write Berkshire Hathaway annual reports</span>
</div><div class="author">By Katherine Clarke </div><div>439 words</div><div>28 August 2018</div><div>15:31</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2018 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Billionaire investor Warren Buffett is slashing the price of his California beach house to $7.9 million, after putting it on the market for $11 million in February 2017, according to a spokeswoman for the listing agent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the property sells for its new asking price, Mr. Buffett will still make an impressive return, having paid just $150,000 for the home in the early 1970s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 87-year-old Berkshire Hathaway chairman, the third-richest man in the world according to Forbes magazine, spent holidays at the beach house. He said in an interview last year that he bought the house because his late first wife, Susan, loved it. Since she died in 2004, he hasn't spent much time there, which prompted him to list the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the Laguna Beach area had changed dramatically since then, becoming more developed. The house was renovated several times through the years but not recently, said the spokeswoman for the listing agent. Mr. Buffett also purchased an adjacent house, which he called "the annex," to make space for house guests, and connected the two homes with a staircase. The annex was sold in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Buffett recalled hiding out in the home's master bedroom to write <span class="companylink">Berkshire Hathaway</span>'s annual reports during Christmas holidays, and visiting Disneyland with his children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The roughly 3,500-square-foot, three-level Laguna Beach home is in Emerald Bay, a high-end gated community with views of the beach. It has six bedrooms. Two of the bedrooms have their own separate entrances for guests. The house fits Mr. Buffett's famously understated tastes, with gray carpeting and white laminate countertops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home price for Orange County is $829,000, according to the <span class="companylink">California Association of Realtors</span> data from July. While that is up 5.6% from July 2017, the number of total sales fell 1.4% during that same period. Also in July, the share of price cuts on active listings in Orange County was 22%, up from 18% the previous July, according to listings portal Realtor.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither Mr. Buffett nor his real-estate agent, Bill Dolby of Villa Real Estate, was available to comment. The agent is a friend of Mr. Buffett's daughter, Susie.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Katy Stech Ferek </div><div>520 words</div><div>24 August 2018</div><div>12:22</div><div>WSJ Pro Bankruptcy</div><div>RSTPROBK</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2018, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bankruptcy judge cleared the Roman Catholic Diocese of Las Vegas to pay more than $8 million to the construction firm that built the city's Bishop Gorman High School, ending a long-running fight over the project's final cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, Judge August Landis of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Las Vegas approved the settlement [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/las-vegas-diocese-construction-firm-end-payment-dispute-1534276425] between school officials, the diocese and <span class="companylink">J.A. Tiberti Construction Co</span>., which won a lawsuit last year to collect nearly $30 million for the school's building costs. The deal takes pressure off diocese officials to sell the Bishop Gorman campus, which cost $117 million to build and opened in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The school building sits on 52 acres of land owned by the nonprofit Bishop Gorman Development Corp., which is controlled by the diocese. Bishop Gorman Development filed for bankruptcy last year amid the payment dispute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the settlement, <span class="companylink">J.A. Tiberti Construction</span> will take $8.6 million in payments from the diocese, plus an additional $2.4 million in either cash or church property in the future. The Aug. 8 deal was reached after several rounds of mediation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the settlement, construction firm officials had pushed the diocese to pay $4 million at the end of bankruptcy, with a further $30 million to be paid over an eight-year period. They criticized the diocese's earlier offer to pay $10 million of the nonprofit's debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Diocese officials formed Bishop Gorman Development Corp. more than a decade ago to raise donations to build a new campus for Bishop Gorman High School, which was founded in 1954. The nonprofit bought vacant land in 2003 and later leased it to the diocese through 2061.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under <span class="companylink">J.A. Tiberti Construction</span>'s contract, the firm agreed to forgo profit from the project and charge only for expenses. Those expenses would be paid over time with money from the school's rent payments and donations. The retired president of J.A. Tiberti Construction, Tito Tiberti, is a longtime donor to the school, which has about 1,500 students.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tiberti, whose firm has built more than 15 hotel-casino projects, served on Bishop Gorman Development's board of directors and several members of the Tiberti family attended the school, according to court papers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the years, however, the relationship between the construction firm and the school "turned decidedly sour," partly because of the cost, according to earlier court papers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the new campus opened in 2009, J.A. Tiberti sent a final bill for the project's costs, and a state court judge said last year the nonprofit owed the construction company $28.7 million. The construction firm's lawyers later pushed to take about $5.4 million from Bishop Gorman Development's bank account, prompting the campus owner to file for chapter 11 protection in April 2017.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maine's highest court blocked the latest attempt by Gov. Paul LePage to block Medicaid expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maine's Supreme Judicial Court on Thursday said two lower-court rulings ordering the state to begin executing the voter-approved Medicaid expansion stand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Backed by nearly 60% of Maine voters in November, the expansion would cover more low-income residents while making the state the 32nd to adopt a key plank of the Affordable Care Act.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter Steele, a spokesman for Mr. LePage, said the governor's legal team is studying the decision and considering its options.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">November's ballot measure arose after the governor vetoed five attempts by the Legislature to expand Medicaid in Maine under the Affordable Care Act.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Sales of new homes declined for the second straight month, the latest in a string of economic data pointing to a soft run in the housing market amid an otherwise booming economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of newly built single-family homes—a relatively narrow slice of all U.S. home sales—declined 1.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 627,000 in July, the Commerce Department said Thursday. This is the slowest rate since last October in the aftermath of damaging hurricanes that hit the Southern and Eastern U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">July's drop bucked economists' expectations of a robust gain and is among recent signs that rising input costs, supply constraints and financial conditions are putting the brakes on a key segment of the robustly growing economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If the inventory of new homes for sale is the primary reason for recent declines in new sales, home builders can remedy that by building more single-family homes—as we expect they will," said David Berson, Nationwide chief economist. "This is very different than the situation for existing homes, where the shortage of homes for sale is unlikely to be alleviated in the near term."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 52.3% decline in new-home sales in the Northeast helped drive down overall sales in July. This was the largest one-month drop for new-home sales in this region since the beginning of 2015. Sales grew 7.2% in January through July from the prior year. Still, the pace of new-home sales remains well below the elevated levels seen before the 2007-09 financial crisis and recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affordability challenges caused by rising prices and mortgage rates are causing the first sustained slowdown in the housing market in five years. The share of new and existing homes available to a family making the median income fell to 57% in the second quarter from nearly 62% in the first quarter of this year, according to an index produced by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> and <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said that is creating more caution among home buyers and making it harder for builders to raise the cost of new homes in response to labor and material costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The new-home market has clearly slowed," said real-estate consultant John Burns. Still, he cautioned against the perception that it is "armageddon."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Builders have just pushed prices because of cost increases and there's been a consumer pushback," Mr. Burns added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes have been essentially flat for the last 18 months, with an especially pronounced slowdown in the last six months. That has yet to translate to a national slowdown in price growth, but economists said that if buyers remain cautious, sellers are going to have to adjust their price expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report released Thursday by Zillow found that home-value growth in July slowed in two-thirds of the nation's largest housing markets, including Seattle, Denver and Portland. Home values across the U.S. rose 8% in the past year, 0.7 percentage point faster than the year before. But Zillow economists predict the annual appreciation rate will drop to 6.8% within the next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The nation's pricier markets are starting to feel an affordability squeeze as buyers begin to balk at the sustained, rapid rise in prices that have followed the strong job growth and high housing demand of the past half-decade," said Zillow senior economist Aaron Terrazas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's new-home sales report showed the median sales price of a new home grew 6.0%, the largest monthly gain since the end of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One bright spot for home buyers is that mortgage rates, which rose sharply in the spring, have more recently flattened out. The average rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage inched back to 4.51% this week from 4.53% a week earlier—hitting the lowest level since mid-April, according to data released Thursday by <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. Nonetheless, the rate for a 30-year mortgage a year ago was just 3.86%, near historic lows.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of previously owned homes continued their longest downward slide in five years in July as rising prices and higher mortgage rates kept more potential buyers out of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales fell 0.7% in July from June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.34 million units, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Wednesday. The drop marked the fourth straight month of declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with a year earlier, sales in July were down 1.5%. Rising prices and limited inventory of affordable housing are continuing to sideline buyers despite solid economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Too many would-be buyers are either being priced out or are deciding to postpone their search until more homes in their price range come on to the market," said Lawrence Yun, the trade group's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With prices at all-time highs and the economy booming, this would normally be a prime opportunity for current owners to sell, adding to inventory and generating more activity in the housing market. Instead, many are staying put, often choosing to renovate rather than give up low mortgage rates and pay significantly higher prices for their next homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Underlying demand is edging higher, but you can't sell more homes if they're not there to be sold," said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide Insurance and a former Fannie Mae chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A shortage of homes on the market has fueled the sharp rise in prices, which rose 4.5% in July from a year earlier to a median price of $269,600. Average hourly wages, by comparison, were up 2.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yun said rising mortgage rates as the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> tightens monetary policy have also helped make home buying more costly.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the nation's largest builders of high-end homes rode strong sales to a 30% jump in quarterly profit, bucking weakness in the broader U.S. housing market and bolstering evidence that the wealthiest Americans are spending big as the economy strengthens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Toll Brothers Inc</span>. said the profit surge came as its revenue for the quarter ended July 31 climbed 27% to $1.91 billion. Customers of the Horsham, Pa., company added $165,000 on average toward the customization and design of their houses in the period, Chief Executive Douglas Yearley Jr. said on a call with investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High-end retailers also have reported robust results, another sign that many wealthier Americans feel flush. <span class="companylink">Nordstrom Inc</span>. said sales were up 7% in its most recent quarter, and Coach, which is owned by <span class="companylink">Tapestry Inc</span>., reported a 5% increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts expect strong results from <span class="companylink">Tiffany &amp; Co</span>. when it reports earnings next week. Kering, owner of Gucci, Saint Laurent and other luxury brands, said first-half revenue in North America surged 45%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While U.S. consumer sentiment slid in early August, it remains strong among top-earning households, said Richard Curtin, chief economist for the University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers. Households in the top third of income distribution -- who make up half of all retail spending -- "are well positioned," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those households reported greater income gains and believe their wealth will rise over the coming year. Top earners expect wage gains of 3% in the coming year, according to Mr. Curtin, while households in the bottom third of income distribution expect a pay raise of just 0.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> said it expects the average price for its homes in the current fiscal year to be $835,000 to $860,000, raising the low end of its previous guidance by $5,000. <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span>' share price surged nearly 14% Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The builder's strong results contrast with weakness in the broader housing market. Rising prices, higher mortgage rates and a lack of inventory have pushed many less wealthy buyers out of the market. Sales of previously owned homes fell 2.2% in June from a year earlier, the fifth time in six months they declined on a year-over-year basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affluent buyers are more easily able to shrug off higher mortgage rates and home prices than middle-class purchasers, analysts said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. household net worth passed $100 trillion in the first quarter, thanks in part to rising home values, according to a <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> report. Much of that is concentrated among high-end households.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's confidence in the economy," said Jack Micenko, a senior analyst at <span class="companylink">Susquehanna International Group</span>. "People having equity in their homes is a huge confidence driver."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But weak wage increases combined with rising home prices, tighter credit and a lack of lower-priced houses made for a slow start to the recovery for the starter-home market, despite strong demand from millennials who increasingly have been trying to buy homes. At the same time, the higher end of the market has generally recovered strongly since the recession and housing-market crash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes over $1 million rose 7.6% in June compared with a year earlier, while sales of homes from $750,000 to $1 million rose 6%, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. At the same time, sales between $100,000 and $250,000 fell 7.1% -- further evidence that affordability poses a bigger challenge to middle-class buyers than higher-income ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inflation also is edging up, which threatens to eat into wages of all Americans. But the more affluent tend to have much of their savings in stock and other financial instruments, which have been rising in recent years. U.S. stocks are on the verge of surpassing their longest-running rally, and on Tuesday the S&amp;P 500 stock index rose to its first intraday record since January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This has given many wealthy consumers the confidence to spend on big-ticket items like homes, despite a number of developments that economists say could derail the long expansion. The prospect of a trade war between the U.S. and major trading partners such as China and Europe is already slowing some business spending, and rising interest rates could slow borrowing and growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But executives at Toll said on an analyst call they see little evidence that rising rates are forcing their buyers to stretch financially. Buyers' loan-to-value ratio in the company's fiscal third quarter dropped to 67% from a more typical level of 70%. All-cash buyers jumped to 24% of all customers this year from a more typical 20%. Both metrics indicate that Toll buyers aren't straining and taking on more debt to afford houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yearley said buyers are more willing to pay a bigger premium for a brand-new home than he has seen in his 28-year career.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meantime, the market for $5 million-plus homes in New York City has slowed. Sales of apartments in that category fell 31% in the year's first half, compared with the 2017 period, according to a report by real-estate firm Stribling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The top end of the market attracts foreign investors and ultra-high-net-worth individuals, and a slowdown doesn't necessarily portend trouble for <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> or less-wealthy buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, economists will be looking to data from the Realtors on July existing-home sales for more clues on the market's direction.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Home construction across the U.S. staged a modest rebound last month after a big June drop, but was weaker than Wall Street had expected, with many analysts taking a bleak view of the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts grew 0.9% in July from the prior month, significantly weaker than the 8.3% bounce back economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected. This follows a sharp 12.9% drop in housing construction in June, the largest monthly decline since the end of 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"After a tough report last month, this is strike two for the housing market," said John Pataky, executive vice president at TIAA Bank. "This report reflects some fundamental issues that cloud the housing horizon."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weaker-than-expected home building could signal fewer homes on the market in the coming months, potentially exacerbating supply constraints in the housing sector. Rising borrowing costs are an added headwind to the market, making the residential sector a drag on an otherwise robust national economy. Residential investment has contracted in four of the past five quarters, according to the <span class="companylink">Bureau of Economic Analysis</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"June appeared to be an anomaly, but July results indicate a trend," said Scott Volling, principal at <span class="companylink">PricewaterhouseCoopers</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, a gauge of U.S. home-builder confidence fell in August after plateauing in July and declining for much of 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, home builders seem willing to attempt to push through new construction projects. Residential building permits, which can signal how much construction is in the pipeline, for single-family homes grew 1.9% in July from the prior month, the largest monthly gain since October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The broader trend shows the housing market notching continued building, as starts rose by 6.2% in the first seven months of 2018 compared with the same period a year earlier. Housing-starts data are volatile from month to month and can be subject to large revisions. July's 0.9% increase for starts came with a margin of error of 11.5 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts argued weather could have been at play in the recently weak figures. While construction grew in the South and Midwest, they declined in the Northeast and fell starkly in the West in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There have been extensive weather issues in the West this summer, including wildfires and a regionwide heat wave, while the Northeast was very wet in July … and so far in August," said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities, in a note to clients Thursday. "If this factor is impacting the data, then do not be surprised if August is relatively soft as well."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, single-family home building has held near the highest levels since before the 2007-09 recession, while construction of multifamily buildings eased as the market for new condominiums and apartments has cooled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starts grew in July from the prior month for single-family construction and multifamily construction. Permits last month were up for buildings with five or more units and for single-family homes compared with June.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market isn't doing so well this year, but somebody forgot to tell <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big home-improvement retailer on Tuesday reported a strong second quarter, with earnings of $3.05 a share versus the $2.84 analysts expected, and same-store sales increasing 8% versus an anticipated 6.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Considering what is happening in the housing market -- home sales this year are running below last year's levels as rising rates and higher prices cut into home affordability -- that counts as an impressive performance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company expects the good times to continue, and raised its sales and earnings guidance for the year. It is a reflection of a changed environment: In the past, home sales tended to drive purchases at <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>. Now homeowners are spending more money at its stores even when they stay put.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chief reason for the change is that while weak home sales have historically reflected straitened circumstances among would-be home buyers, today's weakness in home sales has more to do with a lack of supply. The sharp decline in new construction since the housing bust has reduced the number of homes available to a growing population, making it more difficult and expensive to move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So people are fixing up the homes they already have, and since the values of their homes have risen, they feel pretty comfortable doing that. Moreover, the drop-off in home building has raised the average age of homes in the U.S., and those older homes may be more in need of repair and new amenities. A recent <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> analysis of census data found that the median age of owner-occupied housing was 37 years in 2016 versus 31 years a decade earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like homeowners who are staying put, the retailer has been improving its existing stores rather than opening new ones. One of its latest improvements is pickup lockers where customers can retrieve goods they have ordered online without having to wait at a service desk. That is helping it deepen the natural moat it has against <span class="companylink">Amazon.com</span>, which hasn't been able to encroach on the home-improvement market (with its costly-to-ship, heavy items) as easily as other areas. <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> has also used its cash to buy back one-third of its shares in the past decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For investors, the biggest sticking point on <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> shares may be their price: They trade at 19.8 times expected earnings versus 17 times for smaller rival <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span>. On the other hand, <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> hardly counts as a fixer-upper.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto </div><div>698 words</div><div>13 August 2018</div><div>08:00</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2018 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trump administration wants to shift the way it enforces an aspect of fair housing around the U.S., pivoting away from efforts to integrate lower-income housing into wealthier neighborhoods in favor of promoting more housing development overall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span> announced the change[https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_18_079] on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HUD will begin holding stakeholder hearings on how to change the way it determines whether communities are enforcing the Fair Housing Act, which requires local governments to institute policies that help break down patterns of housing segregation. HUD stakeholders include nonprofit groups, academic researchers and private businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration took steps to encourage the development[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/hud-announces-rule-designed-to-bolster-so-called-fair-housing-initiatives-1436370563?mod=article_inline] of low-income housing in high-income neighborhoods. In an interview, HUD Secretary Ben Carson said he plans instead to focus on restrictive zoning codes. Stringent codes have limited home construction, thus driving up prices and making it more difficult for low-income families to afford homes, Mr. Carson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shift is expected to derail a signature Obama-era accomplishment. HUD had aimed to use computer technology[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/hud-drops-obama-era-tool-aimed-at-enforcing-fair-housing-law-1526691328] to make it easier for communities to comply with fair-housing rules and to make it easier for the federal government to check whether they were following those rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But local officials in some communities said the process was costly and amounted to the federal government forcing them to put low-cost rental buildings in wealthier areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Carson said he wants to simplify the process for communities and address the proliferation of stricter land-use rules in recent decades. Home construction is near 60-year lows[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/american-housing-shortage-slams-the-door-on-buyers-1521395460] by some measures, in part because communities over time have layered on regulations that make development difficult and costly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I want to encourage the development of mixed-income multifamily dwellings all over the place," Mr. Carson said. He hopes to have a new rule in place by the fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The secretary pointed to Los Angeles as an example of how zoning rules stymie housing development. He said a large majority of the city's parcels of land are eligible only for single-family home development, not larger projects that could house more people and help moderate price growth. "Of course you're going to have skyrocketing prices that no one can afford," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Policy makers have long puzzled over how to create incentives for cities and towns to build more housing. Local officials are often in a difficult political position because the loudest voices among their constituents tend to be those objecting to development. At the same time, federal and state governments have limited control over local zoning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Carson said the new rule would tie HUD grants, which many communities use to build roads, sewers, bridges and other infrastructure projects, to less restrictive zoning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I would incentivize people who really would like to get a nice juicy government grant" to take a look at their zoning codes, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advocate groups for housing for minorities and for those with low income have criticized the Trump administration for rolling back several Obama policies aimed at stepping up enforcement of the Fair Housing Act, which turned 50 in April. Critics say HUD has neglected its responsibility to enforce the act, contributing to inequities in homeownership, wealth and education for blacks and other minorities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Obama era, officials prioritized making it easier for lower-income people to move to wealthier communities, citing research[http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/] that showed it improved outcomes for children. HUD's latest move is another sign that the Trump administration has a different philosophy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Carson said he is unconcerned about what "theoreticians" will say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The last administration, when they put this together they really went down an ideological pathway," he said. "We are going to look at the people who are actually affected, what are they saying, what will be helpful to them."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto </div><div>650 words</div><div>9 August 2018</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2018 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Western states experienced the sharpest decline for existing-home sales in the second quarter, a sign that rising prices, higher mortgage rates and, to a limited extent, the new tax law are weighing on pricier markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales in the western region, including California, Washington and Arizona, declined 4.1% in the second quarter compared with the first quarter, according to data released Wednesday by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales in the Northeast were unchanged from the first quarter, while sales in the more affordable Midwest and South rose 1.6% and declined 2.7%, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising home prices and interest rates are worsening affordability and damping home sales across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the West, which has seen a particularly sharp run-up in prices in the six-year housing rebound, is bearing the brunt of the slowdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The West region has the fastest job-growing regions in the country, yet sales are coming down" because prices have risen so much, said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the NAR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twenty-six percent of California households could afford to purchase a home at the median price of $596,730 in the second quarter, down from 31% in the first quarter, according to a separate report released Wednesday by the <span class="companylink">California Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2012, 56% of households could afford to purchase the median-price home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yun said the tax bill, which went into effect in January and reduced the incentives for homeownership in more-expensive markets, isn't having a major affect. But anecdotally, realtors suggest that it is having a small impact in high-tax spots such as New Jersey, Connecticut and the top end of the California market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Right now I would say the tax impact is isolated" to small pockets around the U.S., Mr. Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market cooled in metropolitan areas across the country in the second quarter, with the pace of second-quarter sales slowing 2.4% compared with a year ago, according to the <span class="companylink">NAR</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yun blamed a lack of supply for the weak second-quarter sales numbers. Supply ticked up by 0.5% in the second quarter compared with a year earlier but remains below normal levels, according to the <span class="companylink">NAR</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price increases moderated for metro areas across the country, but affordability continued to worsen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median existing single-family-home price rose 5.3% to hit a record $269,000. Two metropolitan markets -- San Jose, Calif., and San Francisco -- now have a median home price above $1 million. The typical home in the San Jose area now costs more than $1.4 million, while in San Francisco it costs $1.07 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family home prices increased in 90% of 178 metropolitan areas measured by the <span class="companylink">NAR</span>'s quarterly index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in some welcome news for buyers, the pace of price increases has slowed. Only 13% of metro areas in the index saw double-digit price increases in the second quarter, down from 30% in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As demand retreats somewhat, sellers understand they can't be too aggressive in raising prices," Mr. Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prospects of a strong pickup for the housing market in the latter half of the year don't look terribly strong, according to economists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The share of people who believe now is a good time to purchase a home fell 4 percentage points in July and the net share who say now is a good time to sell fell 6 percentage points, according to data released by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> on Tuesday. The survey is often a good indicator of consumer behavior over the next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People are getting nervous about paying up with house prices rising as fast as they are," said Doug Duncan, Fannie Mae's chief economist.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price gains held steady in May, as a lack of sale inventory helped prevent a meaningful slowdown in price growth despite rising mortgage rates and growing affordability challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which measures average home prices in major metropolitan areas, rose 6.4% in May, identical to the year-over-year increase in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An index of 10 cities gained 6.1% over the year, down from 6.4% the prior month. The 20-city index gained 6.5%, down from 6.7% the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The annual increase in the Case-Shiller national index has topped 5% every month since August 2016. Price gains are at this point one of very few strong spots in the housing market, as a lack of inventory is helping to give sellers continued pricing power despite slowing sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with a strong economy and the large millennial generation hitting prime homebuying age, the housing market has been lackluster this spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
David Blitzer, managing director at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, said rising prices were contributing to a slowdown in virtually every other housing-market indicator -- from existing-home sales to housing starts to pending home sales, which have lagged behind year-ago activity for six straight months, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> reported on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The combination of rising home prices and rising mortgage rates are beginning to affect the housing market," Mr. Blitzer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest price gains remained concentrated in the West. Seattle saw a 13.6% annual gain in prices in May compared with a year earlier, while Las Vegas prices increased 12.6% and San Francisco saw a 10.9% increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising mortgage rates have contributed to a slowdown in the pace of home sales and may also be putting slight downward pressure on prices. The rate for a 30-year mortgage was 4.54% last week, up from 3.99% at the end of last year, according to mortgage company <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Month-over-month, the U.S. Case-Shiller home-price index rose 1.1% in May before seasonal adjustment, while the 10-city and the 20-city index rose 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively, from April to May.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto </div><div>721 words</div><div>27 July 2018</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2018 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign purchases of U.S. homes had their biggest drop ever, bringing relief to waves of American house hunters who have struggled to compete in affluent neighborhoods with wealthy buyers from abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases by international buyers totaled $121 billion in the fiscal year ended in March, down from $153 billion the previous year, according to a survey by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> released Thursday. That 21% decline was the largest on record, the <span class="companylink">NAR</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop in foreign interest helps well-heeled buyers in places like Manhattan, Seattle, San Francisco, Miami, and Orange County, Calif. While foreigners make up a small share of the overall U.S. housing market, they are concentrated near the high end of the market and are more likely to pay in cash and bid above the asking price, according to agents in these markets. That has challenged local buyers to come up with larger down payments and pay more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sharp decline in purchases reflected higher home prices, a strengthening dollar and intensifying political tensions between the U.S. and other parts of the world, economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The [discussion of a] trade war or just the rhetoric against foreigners may have dampened some of the enthusiasm to buy property in the U.S.," said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at NAR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pullback creates an additional challenge for many sellers, who have welcomed foreign interest and the ease of all-cash deals. The housing market is already slowing, especially for developers of higher-end condos, some of whom heavily marketed their units to foreign investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This might be the first time in my career that I'm seeing more Chinese sellers than buyers," said John Chang, a broker-owner at Engel &amp; Volkers in New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a trip to China last week, Mr. Chang said he realized that Chinese news coverage of the U.S. is spooking would-be buyers. "It's staggering," he said of the negative coverage, including editorials saying now isn't a safe time to invest in the U.S. and articles chronicling real-estate developments funded by Chinese investors that have gone bankrupt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese buyers remained the largest purchasers of U.S. homes but their purchases fell 4% from the previous year to $30.4 billion. Purchases by Canadians, the second-most-prolific purchasers, dropped 45% to $10.5 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales have fallen on an annual basis in five of the past six months, buffeted by rising prices, a long stretch of low inventory and rising mortgage rates. The decline in purchases by overseas buyers is adding to the market's woes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly 40% of Chinese buyers bought in California, which has a large Asian community, good air quality and strong universities. But Chinese buyers recently have been unable to get money out of their country and also are concerned about growing tensions with the U.S., according to agents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kerry Lynn, an agent at <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> in New York, said she used to conduct more than half of her business with Chinese purchasers but hasn't traveled to China in six months. She has shifted to finding local clients and helping Chinese clients sell what they already own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Lynn said the main hurdle is that the Chinese government has tightened restrictions, allowing residents to take only $50,000 out of the country and requiring banks to report what the money is being used for. Tuition is an acceptable use but buying real estate generally isn't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian buyers, who primarily buy vacation and retirement properties in Florida and Arizona, ramped up purchases in recent years only to pull back in the past year. A strong American dollar and tensions between the U.S. and Canada over trade negotiations have driven the pullback, according to agents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brent Leathwood, a broker in Florida, said Canadian professional investors are taking a wait-and-see approach and retiring baby boomers are simply scaling back what they purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The political uncertainty "destroys investors' ability to make long-term investments decisions with confidence and we are seeing this uncertainty rear its ugly head," Mr. Leathwood said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. new-home sales fell in June to the weakest pace in eight months, the latest evidence that the housing market is cooling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of newly built single-family homes—a narrow slice of all U.S. home sales—decreased 5.3% from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 631,000 in June, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. This marks the slowest rate for new-home sales since October and adds to a body of data pointing to a stalling housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales, which make up the bulk of the market, declined 2.2% in June from a year earlier, the National Association of Realtors said Monday. Sales of previously owned homes have now declined on an annual basis in five of the first six months of 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide home building also declined sharply in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data on new-home sales can be choppy from month to month, and June's 5.3% decline came with a margin of error of 17.1 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking more broadly, new-home sales still appeared to hit a stumbling block. The three-month average for home sales came in at a rate of 646,000 for the three months ending in June, the lowest average since the period that ended in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've had a pretty significant increase in interest rates, and we've had sustained home price increases over the past five or six years…that's starting to really kind of eat into that affordability question for a lot of buyers," said Tendayi Kapfidze, chief economist at LendingTree.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 4.57% in June, up from 4.03% in January, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventory ticked up to a 5.7-month supply at the end of June, the highest rate since last summer. The number of new homes for sale in June reached the highest level since March 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Despite rising costs, builders are succeeding at delivering more homes," said Aaron Terrazas, senior economist at Zillow. "But it remains to be seen how long they can continue what is becoming a very complicated dance as costs march upward and rising mortgage rates gradually eat into home buyers' affordability."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sluggish housing starts and permits data could signal potential headwinds going forward, Mr. Terrazas said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More broadly, sales rose 6.9% in the first six months of 2018 compared with the first half of 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sale price for a new home sold in June was $302,100, down 4.2% from a year earlier. This sales price hit a recent peak of $335,400 in March and has gradually declined since.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the drop in the median sales price is due to a lower share of new-home sales occurring in the West, a more expensive region, Mr. Terrazas said. In June, the West accounted for about 23% of new-home sales versus 30% in January.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales slumped in the second quarter despite what was likely the strongest period for U.S. growth in years, the latest sign that the economic expansion faces headwinds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales slipped 0.6% in June from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.38 million, the National Association of Realtors said Monday. Compared with a year earlier, sales in June declined 2.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales have now declined on an annual basis in five of the first six months this year, a worrying trend since housing is considered a crucial indicator of overall economic health, economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By a number of measures, the economy looks to be accelerating after a long stretch of subpar growth. Economists are forecasting U.S. growth to exceed 4% for the second quarter when numbers are released on Friday. Jobless claims are falling, and corporate profit growth continues to looks strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But weakness in the housing market could muddy the picture. Housing contributes about 15% to 18% of gross domestic product. Existing-home sales help drive other sectors of the economy. Consumer confidence and home-improvement spending, construction and mortgage lending tend to suffer when home sales slump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing market led the general economy out of the recovery and now it's leading" it toward a slowdown, said Zillow Senior Economist Aaron Terrazas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage-application volume decreased 2.5% in the week ending July 13, compared with a week earlier, including a 5% decline in purchase applications, according to an index put out by the Mortgage Bankers Association last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home construction, which is the major driver of housing-related employment, has also struggled lately. Housing starts declined 12.3% in June from the prior month, according to the Commerce Department. That was the largest monthly percentage drop in about a year and a half, driven by construction declines in all regions of the U.S. for almost all types of housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realtors say some buyers have grown weary of the run-up in prices, especially after mortgage rates increased. Brook Hogan, a real-estate agent in Portland, Ore., said she has seen signs that consumers are growing more cautious, especially at the higher end of the market. "It's definitely slowing. Buyer confidence is a big deal," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jessica Aebersold, a 30-year-old who works at a company that rents photo booths, said she and her husband took three weeks to sell their Seattle-area home—in a town where multiple offers in a single weekend had been more the norm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Aebersold said she, too, expected the home to sell in the first weekend, but the day the house was listed, four others went up in the neighborhood. It took three weekends before they received a cash offer $30,000 below the asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't know if people are getting scared," she said. "I was just very surprised that we didn't sell right away."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weakness in the housing market is the latest sign that a nine-year-old economic expansion faces challenges, such as the new tariffs that have increased the prospect of a trade war between the U.S. and China or Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of growth and fears that trade tension could bring inflation have also raised expectations that the Federal Reserve will be more aggressive in raising interest rates. Traders in the federal-funds futures market now believe there is a near certainty that the Fed will raise short-term rates at least once more this year, and a better than 60% chance of two or more rate increases, according to <span class="companylink">CME Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any interest-rate increases could further depress home sales. "One of, if not the most, rate-sensitive sectors in the economy is housing," said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank Securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage already has risen to 4.57% in June from 4.03% in January, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By increasing the monthly cost of owning a home, higher mortgage rates force some buyers to seek out less expensive properties. They can push those at the bottom out of the market altogether.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More notably, they may act as a disincentive for current owners, who enjoy historically low mortgage rates, to sell and lose that rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While rising mortgage rates typically help slow price growth, the lack of inventory has meant that prices have continued growing much faster than wages and inflation, compounding affordability concerns. The median sale price for an existing home in June hit a new all-time high of $276,900, up 5.2% from a year earlier, according to NAR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowdown in sales was concentrated at the bottom end of the market, indicating that affordability concerns are a major contributor to the slow spring selling season. Sales of homes priced at $100,000 to $250,000 fell 7.1% in June, compared with a year earlier, while sales of homes between $750,000 and $1 million grew 6%, according to NAR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strong price growth also indicates that there is still robust demand for homes, and that if inventory continues to increase, the market could regain momentum in the latter half of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some 40% of home sales each year take place in the critical spring selling period of March through June. Even if sales pick up later in the year, they are unlikely to fully make up the lost ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't think the housing-market sky is falling," said Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist at Veritas Urbis Economics. "The fact that the price growth remains strong leads me to believe this isn't a cyclical issue, at least just yet."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new tax law that reduced incentives for home ownership in the northeast, California and other states may eventually weigh on home prices in those areas, economists said. But so far, home sales data shows that markets most affected by the new tax law aren't generally doing worse than the overall market. And sales of higher-end homes, which are also have been affected by the law, were strong in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a long stretch where economists have blamed a lack of inventory for this year's lackluster housing-market performance, there are recent indications that the trend is beginning to reverse. But that suggests demand may be waning as buyers take longer to purchase, leaving properties on the market longer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were 1.95 million existing homes available for sale last month, up 4.3% from the prior month and 0.5% from a year ago. That is the first yearly inventory increase since the middle of 2015, according to Lawrence Yun, the trade group's chief economist.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week features gross domestic product and home-sales data from the U.S. and monetary-policy decisions in the eurozone and Turkey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MONDAY: The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>, a Washington-based trade group, releases its June report on existing-home sales in the U.S. Home sales have been weak in recent months, largely due to an inventory shortage that is driving up prices and keeping some potential buyers off the market. Rising mortgage rates are also pushing up the overall cost of owning a home. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect sales to rise 0.4% in June from the prior month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TUESDAY:<span class="companylink">Turkey's central bank</span> releases a policy statement after investors dumped the Turkish lira as global investors turned away from emerging market currencies. The currency plunged 3.5% after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan appointed his son-in-law as finance minister and put in place measures that could curb the independence of <span class="companylink">Turkey's central bank</span>. Some analysts think the central bank will raise rates this quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THURSDAY: The <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> releases a policy statement. In June, the eurozone's annual rate of inflation rose above the <span class="companylink">ECB</span>'s target for the first time since early 2017. And in early June, the bank said it expected to end its loose monetary policy in December, citing its increased confidence that inflation would settle at its target of close to but just below 2% over the medium term. Still, a lot of the pickup is due to rising energy prices, making the specter of tightened policy a more difficult path.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FRIDAY: The United States Commerce Department releases economic growth figures for the second quarter. Gross domestic product grew at a weak 2.0% annual rate at the beginning of this year, but analysts are expecting GDP will notch much stronger growth in the most recent quarter. Robust retail sales are largely driving the bounceback. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street journal expect growth hit a 4.2% rate.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sharon Nunn </div><div>693 words</div><div>18 July 2018</div><div>11:29</div><div>WSJ Pro Central Banking</div><div>RSTPROCB</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2018, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide home building declined sharply in June, a possible sign that construction labor shortages and rising material costs are causing more damage to the housing market than many analysts initially believed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts declined 12.3% in June from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.173 million, the Commerce Department said Wednesday [https://www-census-gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf]. This was the largest monthly percent drop in about a year and a half, driven by construction declines in all regions of the U.S. for almost all types of housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government housing-starts data are exceptionally volatile. Still, the reported decline for June was much bigger than the 2.2% decline analysts expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, residential building permits, which can signal how much construction is in the pipeline, fell 2.2% from May to an annual pace of 1.273 million last month, which was a surprise, as economists had been expecting a 2.2% gain for permits in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The "sharp drop in starts and permits may indicate that labor constraints may be impacting builders' ability to rapidly complete homes more than we thought," said Scott Volling, principal at <span class="companylink">PricewaterhouseCoopers</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising material costs, such as lumber, and a shortage of qualified construction workers has pushed up input costs for home builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This coincides with an overall housing shortage at a time when continued job and wage growth [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/unemployment-rate-falls-to-18-year-low-solid-hiring-in-may-1527856298] are supporting demand for home buying, contributing to a run-up in home prices. On top of that, mortgage rates have risen [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/the-era-of-low-mortgage-rates-is-over-1526635801] in the last year, making home purchases more expensive in the aggregate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Even with a relatively low bar to clear, this month's report still tripped and fell…neither builders nor buyers can keep up" with the current housing-market constraints, said John Pataky, chief consumer and commercial banking executive at TIAA Bank. But with "this year's results still mixed to positive, it's too early to declare a trend."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The broader trend shows construction growing, as starts rose by 7.8% in the first six months of 2018 compared with the same period a year earlier. But the surprise drop in permits has worried some analysts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's been a noticeable slowdown in [permit] activity this year," said Freddie Mac Chief Economist Sam Khater. "It's alarming that the single-family construction permit growth is decelerating at a time when home ownership is rising and millennials are reaching their peak age to really enter the market and buy their first home."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">June's starts report suggests housing may have been a weaker contributor to economic growth in the second quarter than previously expected. After the report was released, <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> revised down its estimate of how much residential investment contributed to gross domestic product in the second quarter, but its overall second-quarter growth prediction remained at 5.3%. <span class="companylink">Macroeconomic Advisers</span>, a forecasting firm, made a similar calculation, and it continues to predict a 5.0% GDP growth rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Housing market activity—sales and construction—likely has peaked for this cycle," Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a note to clients this morning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing-starts data is subject to large revisions. June's 12.3% drop for starts came outside of the margin of error of 8.3 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report also showed starts fell for single-family and multifamily construction in June from the prior month. Permits last month were down for buildings with more than five units but up for single-family homes compared with May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family home building has held near the highest levels since before the 2007-09 recession, while construction of multifamily buildings eased as the market for new condominiums and apartments has cooled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A gauge of U.S. home-builder confidence held steady in July from June, according to a Tuesday report released by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>. The report also showed home builders' expectations for the next six months dropped, but their overall sentiment remains elevated.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese housing prices are accelerating their gains again. Should investors also jump back into Chinese property developers, whose stocks and bonds have been tumbling?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's new-home prices rose 1.1% in June from a month earlier, the fastest pace in 20 months. Housing markets in China's largest cities are clearly picking up steam. Still, the renewed frothiness is likely to worry Beijing, which had introduced a slew of measures to tighten the market. Those seemed to have worked until recently. Now that prices are rising quickly again, even more stringent measures could be introduced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The greater worry comes from China's small towns. Local governments have spent the past few years propping up regional housing markets by offering subsidies to buyers so they can purchase homes directly from developers. That has helped feed rapidly rising debt levels among developers, who have splurged on land buying in the hope that they can build more homes to sell. Chinese land prices boomed in the first half this year, according to <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>. Beijing now seems likely to scale back such subsidies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This bodes ill for developers which have borrowed heavily -- especially on short-term debt -- to grab land and build houses in the past two years. They include major companies like Evergrande, Agile Property and Sunac -- which have already seen the yields on their dollar-denominated bonds surge recently. Investors may want to bet on something with surer foundations than the recent rise in housing prices.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pamela Goldstein was under pressure. A four-bedroom white colonial house in White Plains had just gone on the market and she wanted it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agent who showed her the house with a red front door and a two-car garage in an attached wing advised her that there were other offers on the home. She had better act fast and bid over the asking price he told her, she recalled later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later she learned that her agent, Daniel Cezimbra, was part of a team headed up by his brother-in-law, who had listed the house on behalf of the seller. Both Mr. Cezimbra and his brother-in-law shared in the commission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agents for buyers and sellers routinely share commissions but Ms. Goldstein said she was surprised by their close relationship that wasn't disclosed to her.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Ms. Goldstein is the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit seeking class-action status that accuses her agent's firm, Houlihan Lawrence, a large brokerage firm north of New York City, of systematically maneuvering to represent both the buyer and seller in the same transaction, creating conflicts of interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lawsuit said this "predatory behavior" violated both the spirit and the letter of New York state law. The suit, filed over the weekend in State Supreme Court in Westchester County by law firm <span class="companylink">Boies Schiller Flexner LLP</span>, demanded Houlihan return hundreds of commissions paid when it represented both the buyer and the seller since 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokeswoman for Houlihan Lawrence said the company had just learned of the lawsuit and was reviewing it. "Houlihan Lawrence is confident in its business practices," the spokeswoman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houlihan Lawrence has more than 1,300 agents in 30 offices in Westchester and northern New York suburbs as well as Fairfield County, Conn. In 2016 it had more sales than the next four ranking brokerages combined, the suit noted. Last year <span class="companylink">Berkshire Hathaway Inc</span>.'s <span class="companylink">HomeServices of America Inc</span>. acquired Houlihan Lawrence for an undisclosed amount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The suit takes on a thorny issue in real-estate transactions known as "dual agency," when the same brokerage firm, and sometimes the same agent, represents both buyer and seller. These arrangements create a conflict of interest that can compromise the commitments that agents usually offer to clients, a duty of "undivided loyalty, confidentiality, and full disclosure," under New York law. But these conflicts are permitted—if agents discuss the limitations of the arrangement with clients, who are asked to sign a state form acknowledging that they were aware of the dual representation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The suit alleges that Houlihan Lawrence makes dual agency part of its basic business plan, offering incentives to brokers to steer clients to in-house transactions. According to the suit, the company provides less information than other brokerages on the risks of dual agency, delays discussing the issue with clients, and relies on preprinted versions of the state disclosure forms, with boxes checked rather than letting clients fill them out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lawsuit claims that last year Houlihan represented both the buyer and seller in nine out of 10 of Houlihan Lawrence's biggest home sales in Westchester County, a sales total of more than $47 million. In Bronxville in Westchester, 48 out of 75 Houlihan sales were dual-agency deals, including 80% of all deals for $2 million or more, the complaint alleges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Goldstein, an associate general counsel for a large communications company, said she was shocked to realize that the seller's agents—who Mr. Cezimbra was supposed to be negotiating against—"was not only his boss, but also his brother-in-law." She said that Mr. Cezimbra contacted her after she had called the listing agent at Houlihan Lawrence. Mr. Cezimbra said he was someone who worked with the listing agent, according to Ms. Goldstein.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cezimbra's brother-in-law wasn't available for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Cezimbra said he worked "solely" on Ms. Goldstein's behalf in a difficult, high-pressure situation and worked to protect her interests in the bidding war, in which at least three other offers were made.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"She was well represented," Mr. Cezimbra said. "I feel everything we did was up to par. She had every disclosure laid out to her."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he told her she would have to offer more than the $599,900 asking price, and guided her through a fast-paced bidding war, where buyers had to submit final higher offers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the lawsuit, Mr. Cezimbra only sent a disclosure form advising her of a potential conflict via-email three days after her initial bid. The complaint alleges the pre-checked boxes on the form were incorrect. Eventually she won the house, paying $637,000 in May 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cezimbra said that Ms. Goldstein, as a lawyer, was a sophisticated buyer who was in the process of selling another house and "was very savvy about the market and disclosures."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The week ahead features data on U.S. retail sales, industrial production and housing starts, while Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will testify on Capitol Hill. In Japan, June consumer-price figures will be released.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MONDAY: The <span class="companylink">U.S. Commerce Department</span> releases June retail sales data. In May, sales at U.S. retailers rose 0.8% from a month earlier [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-retail-sales-soared-in-may-1528979553?mod=searchresults&amp;page=2&amp;pos=18] to $502 billion. Economists will be watching to see if June data wraps up a strong quarter for consumer spending, a major engine of U.S. economic growth. Retail sales are expected to increase 0.5% in June, with sales excluding autos up 0.3%, according to economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TUESDAY: The Federal Reserve releases June U.S. industrial production. Industrial output—a measure of everything produced by the nation's factories, mines and utilities— slipped 0.1% in May [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-industrial-production-unexpectedly-declined-in-may-1529069096] from April in seasonally adjusted terms. The unexpected decline was due in part to a fire at a major Ford supplier. Economists will monitor Tuesday's report for signs that the manufacturing sector is picking up steam. Those surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect industrial production increased 0.5% last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to testify on Capitol Hill over two days, beginning Tuesday in the Senate, as part of hearings mandated by law. Investors will be looking for clues about how Mr. Powell might change the Fed's rate plans if the U.S. faces a more protracted trade fight or if long-term bond yields fall below short-term yields, a so-called inversion of the yield curve that has typically preceded a recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WEDNESDAY: The Commerce Department releases data on June U.S. housing starts. In May, housing starts rose 5% [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-housing-starts-rebound-in-may-1529411701] from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.35 million. However, residential building permits, which can signal how much construction is in the pipeline, declined 4.6% to an annual pace of 1.301 million. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal forecast housing starts dropped 2.2% in June to a 1.32 million annual rate, while permits rose 0.7% to a 1.31 million annual rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FRIDAY: Japan's statistics bureau releases the consumer-price index for June (release time is Thursday evening in the U.S.). Despite aggressive monetary easing by the <span class="companylink">Bank of Japan</span> for more than five years, prices have become sluggish again in recent months. In May, core inflation, excluding volatile fresh food prices, rose 0.7% from a year earlier—at the same pace as in the previous month. Economists expect the June figure to come in at 0.9%. The BOJ has a 2% inflation target.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A big mystery of the housing market since the financial crisis is why sales of new homes have remained so low despite a strong economy and real-estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One explanation is a major consolidation among homebuilders, which has given surprising power to some of the big publicly traded companies. That is a big change in what has long been a heavily fragmented industry driven at the margins by small-time construction companies that built like crazy during boom years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing bust and the financial crisis destroyed many home builders. In the tally of U.S. businesses it conducts every five years, the Census Bureau found that there were 48,261 home builders operating in the U.S. in 2012, about half as many as the 98,067 it counted in 2007. In the consolidation, publicly traded home builders fared much better, with only a handful of small ones going bankrupt, and most of those ultimately remained in business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as the economy has recovered and demand for homes has risen, the number of homebuilders doesn't appear to have rebounded. Instead, a few big national players dominate major markets like never before. According to data from Builder magazine, the median market share captured by the top 10 builders in the country's top 25 new-home markets was 63% in 2017. That compared with 34% a decade earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homebuilding is nowhere near as consolidated as industries like airlines, but the result has been similar, less supply. Last year, 1.9 new homes were sold per 1,000 people in the U.S., compared to an average 2.6 over the past 50 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big builders have been able to leverage lower funding costs and economies of scale in ways that smaller players, more dependent on bank lending, haven't. Higher costs on lumber and other products have further squeezed small builders. The big players have also been better able to navigate the tight labor market by promising workers more stable jobs. Average hourly earnings for workers on new single-family homes were up 9% in June from a year ago, versus a 2.7% gain for workers overall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evercore ISI analyst Stephen Kim thinks that the gains the big builders have made in major markets may signal a broad shift in how new homes are built. These companies, focused on profit margins, are using their buying power to lower material costs, and are building homes that are more standardized, less labor intensive and more profitable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Profit margins at <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span>, <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> and <span class="companylink">PulteGroup</span> are substantially higher than smaller public players such as <span class="companylink">KB Home</span>, <span class="companylink">M/I Homes</span> and <span class="companylink">M.D.C. Holdings</span>, he points out. "That suggests that the larger builders are the ones who have figured out how to be more efficient," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While big builders have benefited, the shift has been a drag on the economy. Not only is home building contributing less to gross domestic product and employment than it used to, but it isn't as big a driver of business in areas like furniture and appliance sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The environment isn't uniformly bad for small builders; away from big markets, the business remains far more fragmented.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George Hale, co-owner of Oregon-based Woodhill Homes, says it is harder for small builders like his to get a toehold in the Portland and Bend markets where he operates. As a result of high land prices and regulatory hoops builders need to jump through, the capital requirements to start a project are high. That makes it tough to compete with large public builders,which have readier access to funds. He has been lucky since he focuses on smaller projects that don't interest big builders. But he doesn't see many new people getting into the business. "I'm 48, and all my peers are my age plus."</p>

That is a big change in what has long been a heavily fragmented industry driven at the margins by small-time construction companies that built like crazy during boom years. With its historically low barriers to entry -- a bit of capital and know-how were the major requirements for breaking into the business -- this marks a major change in the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing bust and the financial crisis destroyed many home builders. In the tally of U.S. businesses it conducts every five years, the Census Bureau found that there were 48,261 home builders operating in the U.S. in 2012, about half as many as the 98,067 it counted in 2007.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Updated Census figures won't be available for some time, but even as the economy has recovered and demand for homes has risen, the number of homebuilders doesn't appear to have rebounded. Instead the industry has become more concentrated, with a few big national players dominating major markets like never before. According to data from Builder magazine, the median market share captured by the top 10 builders in each of the country's top 25 new-home markets was 63% in 2017.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big builders have benefited in other ways. They have been able to leverage lower funding costs and economies of scale in ways that smaller players, more dependent on bank lending, haven't. Higher costs on lumber, caused by tariffs and forest fires, and on other building products have further squeezed small builders. The big players have also been better able to navigate the tight labor market by promising workers more stable jobs. Average hourly earnings for workers on new single-family homes were up 9% in June from a year ago, versus a 2.7% gain for U.S. workers overall.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The environment isn't uniformly bad for small builders — away from the big markets, the business remains far more fragmented. In many of those markets, land is easier to come by, points out Chris Herbert, managing director at Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies, while lower sales volumes make them less enticing to the public builders. "The reason why you're seeing the small builders doing OK in the smaller markets is the big builders just don't want to go there," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builder George Hale says that these days it is harder for small builders like him to get a toehold in the Portland and Bend, Ore. markets where he operates.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street is betting that more well-off Americans will want to be renters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financiers who loaded up on homes after the housing bust for pennies on the dollar are buying yet more -- despite home prices in many markets being at all-time highs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their wager: High prices, higher mortgage rates and skimpy inventory are making homeownership harder. Well-to-do families who might have bought a single-family home in another era are willing to rent a house now, especially if it means access to a good school system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes purchased by major investors in 2017 was at least 29,000, up 60% from the previous year, estimates Amherst Capital Management LLC, a real-estate investment firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That marked the first time since 2013 -- when investors like <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span>'s Stephen Schwarzman and Barry Sternlicht of <span class="companylink">Starwood Capital Group</span> gobbled up foreclosed homes -- that investors bought more houses year-over-year. Single-family homes have become far more attractive to investors than apartments, where a nationwide glut has driven down rental yields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, investors have raised billions of dollars to purchase more homes. They have been particularly aggressive buyers in places like Atlanta, Phoenix, and other metro areas with good schools and faster-growing economies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, the investment firm Pretium Partners LLC said it had raised more than $1 billion so that its Progress Residential could add to its 26,000 rental homes. <span class="companylink">Pretium</span> was founded by a former <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>. executive who helped oversee the bank's lucrative bet against the housing market a decade ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash to acquire and renovate homes has become so abundant lately that some rental investors can't spend it fast enough. Without enough homes to buy, some investors are now building their own in popular residential markets like Miami and Nashville, Tenn. -- upending a traditional pattern of Americans buying starter homes and moving up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The American dream no longer includes homeownership," said Jordan Kavana, chief executive of Transcendent Investment Management LLC, a south Florida firm that has been a big acquirer of rental homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transcendent says it has secured more than $250 million, mostly from wealthy Chinese, that it will use to build thousands of rental homes in the Southeast. Toronto's <span class="companylink">Tricon Capital Group Inc</span>. said it is teaming with a U.S. pension fund and a sovereign-wealth fund to enlarge its home-purchasing program over the next three years by about $2 billion, enough for perhaps 12,000 houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're seeing a wider variety of investors coming into this asset class: sovereign-wealth funds, insurance companies, hedge funds, pensions, asset managers," said Sandeep Bordia, Amherst's head of Research and Analytics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Managing far-flung clusters of homes -- much harder than running an apartment building -- has long been a hurdle for investors. But analysts and rental executives say investors are gaining confidence it can be done profitably. Also, wealthier tenants in the single-family-home market typically have children and need more bedrooms than most apartments offer. They're also willing to accept rent increases to stay in good school districts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These investors' war chests have been swelled by rising home prices, which give them more valuable collateral. Transcendent's fund will add about $750 million of debt on top of investors' $250 million or so, giving the firm spending power of about $1 billion over the next three years. Mr. Kavana expects to develop as many as 3,000 homes for his predominantly Chinese clients. "They get that this is a linchpin of the American economy," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Invitation Homes</span>, the industry's 83,000-home heavyweight created by the combination of Messrs. Schwarzman's and Sternlicht's rental ventures, last month sold the largest ever rent-backed bond. The houses that Invitation borrowed $1.3 billion against were valued at 26% more than when they were used as collateral in earlier bond deals, according to <span class="companylink">Kroll Bond Rating Agency</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">American Homes 4 Rent</span>, the country's second-largest single-family rental owner, has been adding houses with proceeds from $500 million of unsecured debt the Agoura Hills, Calif. company sold in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bruce McNeilage, who sold 42 houses in suburban Nashville to American Homes in 2015, has since flipped another 400 or so in middle Tennessee and around Atlanta to larger landlords. He's building dozens of houses in both regions and buying in the Carolinas, some to sell and some to rent out himself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McNeilage had planned to slow down, but local lenders offered financing that was too favorable to pass up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Quantum National Bank</span>, for instance, recently sent Atlanta-area landlords and flippers a memo advertising $10 million that it hoped to lend at promotional rates against rental homes, in chunks ranging from $150,000 to $1.5 million.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An under-construction penthouse in a turn-of-the-century West Village building that once housed a printing press is slated to go on the market for $37.5 million, according to developer Brack Capital Real Estate USA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it sells for that price, it would be among the priciest homes ever to close below 14th Street in Manhattan, according to listing agent Shlomi Reuveni of Reuveni Real Estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 90 Morton Street, the unit is the largest and most expensive of the building's 35 condominiums. The penthouse is roughly 5,820 square feet with a 2,283-square-foot cantilevered terrace. There are four bedrooms, 5½ bathrooms and a library. It also has concrete beams and columns, wide plank oak-flooring and deep window sills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The original structure dates back to 1912. The metal clad upper floors are in contrast to the lighter brick of the original building. The company also clad the first two floors of the building in limestone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amenities include a 64-foot indoor pool, saunas, a fitness center, a children's play room and a common rooftop with an outdoor kitchen. The penthouse is slated for completion in early 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales at the building launched in April, according to the developer. Mr. Reuveni said the project is 30% in contract, including two units priced at $16 million or above, despite the slow Manhattan market. Prices start at roughly $5.3 million for a two-bedroom home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The downturn in the Manhattan apartment market continued through the second quarter, as sales slowed and inventory rose to the highest level in years. Sales dropped by 10.8% compared with the second quarter in 2017, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of city property records.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Allysia Finley </div><div>1026 words</div><div>30 June 2018</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A11</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2018 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nine years into a bull market, housing prices in California have reached record highs. Investors are enjoying soaring capital gains, which in turn has created a windfall for the state budget. California is now sitting on $16 billion in budget reserves while many states struggle to balance their budgets. But beneath this patina of prosperity, many cities are careening toward bankruptcy. Schools are laying off employees and slashing programs. Some districts complain they are having trouble retaining teachers. What gives?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California property taxes, which fund local governments, are capped by the state constitution's Proposition 13 at 1% of a home's value and can't rise by more than 2% annually. So although housing costs have soared since the recession -- the median home price in San Francisco is $1.6 million -- cities and school districts aren't rolling in the dough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, municipalities are getting socked with big bills from the <span class="companylink">California Public Employees' Retirement System</span> and the <span class="companylink">California State Teachers' Retirement System</span>, known as <span class="companylink">Calpers</span> and <span class="companylink">Calstrs</span>. For years the two funds overestimated their investment returns while underestimating their expected payouts. This helped keep local-government and worker pension costs low for a while, but now the state, cities and school districts are having to play catch-up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">School-district pension costs have more than doubled since 2013, and the state legislative analyst's office predicts they will climb another 30% over the next two years. For every dollar cities spend on worker salaries, they have to pay 32 cents to <span class="companylink">Calpers</span>. This effective payroll "tax" charged by <span class="companylink">Calpers</span> will increase to nearly 50 cents on the dollar by 2024. Retirement costs already equal 44% of teacher pay in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Cities want to make it clear that our foundation is rocky at best," Dane Hutchings, a representative of the League of California Cities, told the Calpers Investment Committee last month. "It's crunch time, and quite frankly, we simply cannot stand another market slowdown or substandard returns."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hutchings warned of impending municipal bankruptcies and urged <span class="companylink">Calpers</span> to shoot for higher investment returns to forestall layoffs and cuts to public services. Schools last year issued thousands of pink slips. Hundreds more have gone out this year. Many are laying off secretaries and support staff to pay for teacher raises and pension benefits that have been collectively bargained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, California's high cost of living is making it harder for districts to recruit and retain teachers. A <span class="companylink">Sacramento Bee</span> analysis found that about 18,000 teachers left the state between 2003 and 2016, with the biggest losses occurring during the housing-price peaks. A third of the teachers went to Texas, where the average teacher salary is $53,167, compared with $81,126 in California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Golden State teacher salaries are the second highest in the country after New York and about $13,000 above the state's median annual household income. A midcareer teacher in an affluent district can earn six figures. But even then, many will struggle to afford a home. Thanks to local zoning and state environmental regulations, which have restricted the housing supply, home prices have soared. The median home price in Orange County -- which encompasses high-poverty areas like Santa Ana and Anaheim -- is $714,000. Good luck finding a house for less than $1 million in the Bay Area. A condemned home in Fremont -- about 30 miles south of Oakland -- sold for $1.2 million in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">School districts are raising pay to improve teacher retention, but their budgets are simultaneously being squeezed by increasing pension costs. In 2008 San Francisco voters approved a $198 parcel tax to "recruit and pay teachers a living wage so they don't keep leaving." Parcel taxes are a uniform surcharge on each home that lets school districts circumvent Proposition 13's limits because they are not based on the property's value. Between 2012 and 2017, teacher salary costs rose by a healthy 23%, but retirement costs soared 106%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, voters approved another $298 parcel tax to cover a 16% pay raise so that, according to the referendum, school districts can "increase the salaries of teachers and paraeducators, and ... increase the compensation or benefits of other school district employees." But Reeta Madhavan, chief financial officer of the San Francisco Unified School District, said the second parcel tax was necessary because pension costs are rising by about $5 million each year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Think about it: if we had that $5 million each year, we could put that towards teacher salaries versus paying it out in increased <span class="companylink">Calstrs</span> contribution," Ms. Madhavan recently explained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meantime, higher salaries are pushing up pension costs. That's because teachers' annual pension benefits are linked to their salaries -- typically, final compensation multiplied by 0.02 multiplied by the number of years they worked. <span class="companylink">Calstrs</span> contribution rates are also set as a share of total payroll. So when teacher salaries increase, so do district pension bills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local officials are typically loath to tell voters that they need to raise taxes because pensions are squeezing out services. To sell a $620 parcel tax in 2016, Davis Joint Unified School District in Yolo County warned: "Without the parcel tax, we could not sustain the enrichment and choice that other districts no longer can afford."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the local teachers union complains that the parcel tax burdens school employees, who are being priced out of the area. State Sen. Bill Dodd, a Napa Democrat, has introduced a bill to exempt Davis school-district employees from the parcel tax. The bill passed the state Senate in May and is currently being considered by the Assembly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This bill would provide an additional incentive for public educators and school staff to live in the community in which they work, despite the severe shortage of affordable housing," a legislative analysis says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Behold California's house of cards, propped up by subsidies and exemptions for Democrats' special friends, while taxpayers pay the mortgage.</p>
