<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The volatile housing market of the past 15 years is widening the divide between pricey urban and coastal areas and more affordable inland regions, creating large swaths of winners and losers [http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/graphics/housing-market-recovery/]based largely on geography.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average U.S. home prices rose 5.6% in the 12 months [http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-home-prices-climb-sharply-in-october-1482847647]through October, according to the S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which covers some of the U.S.'s largest metropolitan areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in these areas plummeted 27% from the peak of the housing boom in 2006 to the bottom of the bust in 2012, but set a record high in September, according to the index. Adjusted for inflation, prices are still roughly 15% below the peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the spoils have been concentrated on the high end. A study by Weiss Analytics, a housing-data firm, found homes in ZIP Codes where the median value is $500,000 to $1 million are now worth 103% more than they were 16 years ago, before a boom in the mid-2000s was followed by the worst housing crash since the Great Depression. Home prices in those areas have shot up 39% since the bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet many places around the U.S. missed out on the recent boom, with prices remaining essentially flat during the same period. In ZIP Codes where the median home was worth $100,000 to $150,000, prices have risen 16% since the trough of the market and are now worth 24% more than they were in 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The contrast offers one explanation for the frustration building in the mostly rural, middle-American areas that helped propel Donald Trump to victory in the presidential election. In counties that voted for Mr. Trump, home prices have been largely flat for the past 15 years, according to a county-by-county analysis of home values and voting patterns by real-estate tracker Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In areas that went for Hillary Clinton—mostly coastal urban areas such as California's major markets—home values plunged from 2006-2012 but have roared back since.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January 2000, just before the housing market's boom-bust cycle began, homes in counties that voted for Mrs. Clinton in 2016 were worth $36,000 more than those in the counties that voted for Mr. Trump, according to the Zillow analysis. Today, the gap stands at almost $97,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The difference is even starker in counties that changed how they voted in this election. In counties that swung for Mrs. Clinton, homes are worth about $147,000 more than homes in counties that swung for Trump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Urban areas have benefited in recent years from an influx of younger workers seeking high-paying jobs. At the same time, land-use regulations have constricted supply, helping drive up prices. While the wealthiest homeowners had a rocky ride during the past decade, their homes have recovered most or all the value they lost during the bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In more rural areas outside major cities, demand for housing has been flat, with little new supply and more people leaving for larger cities and coastal regions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The demand for lower-priced homes was also weakened by the tightening of lending standards following the foreclosure crisis, which made it more difficult for buyers with imperfect credit scores or lower incomes to qualify for mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Case-Shiller offers a lagging indicator of the housing market. October's numbers don't reflect the sharp increase in mortgage rates that began after the presidential election. Higher rates tend to put a damper on price growth because they drive up the monthly cost of a mortgage. That combined with prices that have risen faster than incomes could pose challenges to the market next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luzerne County in northeastern Pennsylvania is one area that avoided the worst swings of the housing bust but also has benefited little from the recent recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter DeMarco, a real-estate agent in the area, said people there have less money to spend on housing because wages have gone down for many who work factory jobs. He said the recovery lifting the rest of the U.S. economy has been slow in the county, which voted for President Barack Obama in the last election but accounted for roughly 40% of Mr. Trump's winning margin in the state in 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There wasn't enough attention paid to the economy of us, the small people," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists worry the widening gap could make it more difficult for people in counties like Luzerne to sell their homes to pursue jobs in more prosperous areas with sharply higher housing costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, many people here said flat home values allow recent college graduates and single parents to move from their parents' house to their own home without renting. In nearby New York City and Philadelphia, middle-class people could spend years renting without saving enough money to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some starter homes in Luzerne County are priced at less than $100,000, real-estate agents said, meaning a 3% down payment requires only a few thousand dollars in savings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sara Levy, an agent in Pennsylvania's Lackawanna County, which voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Obama in the last election but only narrowly for Mrs. Clinton in this one, said she sees people moving back from more prosperous areas because they can't afford to buy homes there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nikki Cozza, a 32-year-old interior designer, and her husband, Trevor, searched for two years for a home they could afford in the Rutherford, N.J., area, without luck. Decent homes in the area were priced at about $500,000 and offered about 2,000 square feet, they said. In one instance, they were outbid by about $60,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because they both grew up in the Scranton, Pa., area, in Lackawanna County, they decided to look for homes there. Soon they were able to find one for about $150,000 less than the New Jersey properties they were considering. It is fairly new, with 3,500 square feet and an ample backyard for their young son, they said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Cozza said the area's economic challenges concerned them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That did weigh on [my husband] heavily. It was something he did think about, just because there isn't a lot of large industry or businesses here," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, Ms. Cozza and her husband, an auditor, work from home most days to avoid the nearly two-hour commute to New Jersey. But she said there are local efforts to rebrand the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We feel confident that there could be a little movement here," she said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> Case-Shiller Indices, which covers the entire nation, rose 5.6% in the 12 months ended in October, up from the 5.4% increase reported in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-city index gained 4.3%, up from 4.2% in September. The 20-city index gained 5.1% year over year, up slightly from a 5% increase in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hottest markets in the country remain concentrated in the Northwest, as many buyers priced out of the Silicon Valley area flee to secondary tech hubs. Seattle reported a 10.7% increase, Portland reported a 10.3% year-over-year gain, and Denver had an 8.3% increase in home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Case-Shiller offers a lagging indicator of the housing market. October's numbers don't reflect the sharp increase in mortgage rates that began following the U.S. presidential election in November.</p>

</div><div class="author">By WSJ Staff </div><div>409 words</div><div>25 December 2016</div><div>15:00</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spate of data out of Japan, after a recent upbeat economic assessment by the country's central bank, highlights this week's calendar. Also, a peek at home sales in the U.S. for November will offer early clues on how the rise in interest rates is affecting the housing market and U.S. economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MONDAY: Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda speaks before business leaders in Tokyo (Sunday night Eastern U.S. time). The central bank last week raised its assessment for the economy[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/boj-more-optimistic-about-economy-1482203002] due in part to a weakening yen. The change in circumstances has led to talk of the BOJ raising interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TUESDAY: Japan releases national consumer-price data for November (Monday night Eastern U.S. time), likely showing the BOJ's 2% inflation target is still far from reach. Economists expect core consumer prices, which exclude fresh food, fell 0.4% on the year, the ninth consecutive month of decline[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/japanese-prices-continue-to-fall-1480033811]. Data on household spending, retail sales, unemployment and industrial production are also due from Japan this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WEDNESDAY: In the U.S., a report by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> on pending home sales in November will offer an early look at how the rise in interest rates since Donald Trump's election win is affecting the housing market. NAR's chief economist recently said he expects sales to pick up temporarily as buyers attempt to lock in rates before they rise further. He expects sales to soften in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THURSDAY: Figures released by the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> are expected to show a continued rise in bank lending to households and businesses during November, but at roughly the same, modest pace that previously suggested to policy makers that continued stimulus was needed throughout 2017. Italy's banking system is front and center of concerns about the health of the eurozone's financial system as 2016 draws to a close. But overall credit growth has been weak and indicative of both a reluctance to borrow and an unwillingness to lend, hampering the currency area's weak recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. provides an early look at trade data for November. The strengthening of the dollar in recent months threatens to increase the U.S. trade gap with other nations and restrain overall economic growth.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A man arrested in Phoenix this week as part of an <span class="companylink">FBI</span> terrorism investigation pledged support for Islamic State and researched "lone wolf" attacks online, according to court documents released Friday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael DeLeon, FBI special agent in charge of the Phoenix division, said the investigation is ongoing and there are no indications of any additional threats associated with Mr. Thompson at this time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">FBI</span>'s Joint Terrorism Task Force had been tracking Mr. Thompson for more than two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the court documents, he had tried to buy firearms despite having a felony conviction that barred him from possessing them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The documents described him as an "avowed jihadist," who posted support for Islamic State on websites of the extremist organization. In October, Mr. Thompson searched for the terms "istishad (martyrdom in Arabic) vs. suicide" and "fatwa on killing civilians." He also searched online for powerful guns, according to the documents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Thompson, who was charged in state court, is being held on a $100,000 bond. It was unclear Friday evening whether he had an attorney.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales rose in November and have posted solid growth for the year as a whole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of newly built single-family houses, which account for a small share of overall U.S. home sales, increased 5.2% from October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 592,000 last month, the Commerce Department said Friday. That was the largest one-month gain and the highest level for sales since July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing market remains healthy," Barclays economist Rob Martin said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More broadly, 2016 has seen decent growth in the market for new single-family homes. Sales in the first 11 months of the year were up 12.7% compared with the same period in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the current sales pace, it would take 5.1 months to exhaust the supply of newly built homes on the market at the end of November. The median sale price last month was $305,400, down from $317,000 in November 2015.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dudley, a rural town on the Connecticut border, had been in a dispute with the Islamic Society of Greater Worcester over the group's proposal to build a burial ground on former farmland.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales rose in November and have posted solid growth for the year as a whole, though the recent jump in mortgage rates could restrain homebuying activity in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of newly built single-family houses, which account for a small share of overall U.S. home sales, increased 5.2% from October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 592,000 last month, the Commerce Department said Friday[https://www-census-gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/construction/nrs/pdf/newressales.pdf]. That was the largest one-month gain and the highest level for sales since July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing market remains healthy," Barclays economist Rob Martin said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a smaller November gain to a 580,000 rate. October's sales pace was left unrevised[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-new-home-sales-fall-in-october-1479914130] at 563,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data on new-home sales can be extremely imprecise[http://blogs.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/economics/2014/10/24/new-home-sales-rose-last-month-or-maybe-they-fell-we-dont-really-know/] and volatile from month to month. November's 5.2% sales increase came with a margin of error of 14.1 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More broadly, 2016 has seen decent growth in the market for new single-family homes. Sales in the first 11 months of the year were up 12.7% compared with the same period in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the current sales pace, it would take 5.1 months to exhaust the supply of newly built homes on the market at the end of November. The median sale price last month was $305,400, down from $317,000 in November 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Builders seem prepared to be a little more aggressive to meet the excess of demand over supply, though... higher mortgage rates could produce renewed caution heading into next year," said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities, in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned houses account for about 90% of U.S. home purchases. The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> on Wednesday reported existing-home sales in November rose 0.7% from the prior month[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-rose-in-november-to-new-postcrisis-high-1482334472] to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.61 million, the strongest sales pace since February 2007.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after years of ultralow interest rates that have supported homebuying activity and price growth, borrowing costs have marched higher[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/rising-rates-ripple-through-mortgage-market-1481976007] since the Nov. 8 presidential election and as the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> moves forward with its plan to gradually boost short-term interest rates. The U.S. central bank last week raised its benchmark federal-funds rate[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/fed-raises-rates-for-first-time-in-2016-anticipates-3-increases-in-2017-1481742086] for just the second time since the 2007-09 recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in November was 3.77%, up from 3.47% the prior month, according to Freddie Mac[http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/pmms30.htm]. Rates have risen further in December; <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> reported Thursday[http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/index.html] the average rate was 4.30%, the highest level since April 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sustained rise in borrowing costs could weigh on the U.S. housing market [http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/rising-mortgage-rates-could-threaten-housing-demand-in-2017-1481457602]in the new year. Still, Miami-based home builder Lennar Corp. said this week it expected further gains for the sector[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/lennar-expects-housing-recovery-to-continue-despite-raising-interest-rates-1482149974] in 2017, thanks in large part to continued growth in the broader U.S. economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Even with interest rates moving higher, the first-time home buyer will continue to come back to the market as stronger economic conditions should drive purchasers to the market, undeterred by the marginally higher monthly payment, especially in the context of continued rent increases," Chief Executive Stuart Miller told analysts on Monday. "Lower unemployment, wage growth and general consumer confidence should drive household formation, which drives families to purchase homes and to rent apartments."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With soaring prices, low inventory and a buzzing tech scene, Oakland -- San Francisco's low-key neighbor 6 miles to the east -- has its own crazy housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neighborhoods once known for modest bungalows and starter homes now regularly see million-dollar-plus sales. Condominium and apartment buildings are under construction, transforming once blighted areas into trendy destinations. And the city is bracing for an influx of new jobs as tech companies like Uber and Fluid set up offices downtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rents and prices are skyrocketing in this East Bay city, long considered an affordable alternative to San Francisco. Median home values have grown by more than 70% since 2012, jumping to $658,844 from $387,182, according to <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>. In Rockridge, a popular neighborhood on the Berkeley border, a 2,100-square-foot, two-bedroom house with a guest cottage recently sold for a record $2.4 million, says listing agent Anthony Riggins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While San Francisco's prices are still higher -- the median home value there is $1,095,574 -- its market has cooled a bit in recent months. San Francisco saw home sales volume drop by more than 7% in October from a year earlier, according to real-estate tracker <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>, while Oakland and surrounding areas have remained relatively strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oakland's rising cost of living has attracted attention since the recent fire there that killed 36 people. The tragedy took place in a warehouse that illegally housed a community of artists and others living in unsafe conditions; some survivors said they couldn't otherwise afford to live in the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even for the fairly affluent, finding a home in Oakland can be challenge. "You find a house that you love and there are 10 other people who love it, too," says Karthiga Anandan, a real-estate agent with the <span class="companylink">Grubb Co</span>. Realtors. Waiving all contingencies, including inspections and appraisals, is common in bidding wars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, the most in-demand neighborhoods are the ones near public transportation hubs and tech bus shuttles -- a shift from the previous boom cycle, when demand was for high-end homes in more suburban-feeling areas, says Claudia Mills, a real-estate agent and longtime Oakland resident.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jason Lee, a securities-law attorney, spent nearly every weekend over a seven-month period house hunting. "It was really emotionally draining," he says. After nearly a dozen offers, he and his wife, Doan Nguyen, a public-interest lawyer, finally put in a no-contingency, $901,000 bid for a home that was listed for $739,000, and won.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The roughly 2,000-square-foot home, near Lake Merritt, has three bedrooms and two bathrooms with an in-law unit downstairs. The couple, who have since had a baby, says buying in Oakland was worth it. "It's a very diverse and energetic area," says Mr. Lee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nancy and Mark Atlas reaped the benefits as sellers. With three children (including 11-year-old twins) the couple decided to purchase a larger home in nearby Lafayette. They listed their 2,500-square-foot three-bedroom, cottage-style home in a walkable part of Oakland's Montclair neighborhood for $995,000 in September, expecting to sell it for about $1.2 million. "We went by the open house and it was just packed with people," says Ms. Atlas, a personal life consultant. "It was pretty astounding." According to her listing agent, Jack Cooper of the <span class="companylink">Grubb Co</span>., they got 14 offers and sold the house for $1.65 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a population of 419,000, this 78-square-mile city is known for its mild microclimate, ethnic diversity and dozens of distinct neighborhoods. In the past few years, Oakland has seen a cultural resurgence as well as a booming restaurant scene, partly as artists and chefs priced out of San Francisco decamp to the East Bay. Former industrial spaces and car dealerships now house coffee shops, co-working spaces and bars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are also vast industrial swaths, along the waterfront and elsewhere, and there are many areas pockmarked with abandoned or blighted homes, vacant lots and homeless encampments with clusters of tents under freeway underpasses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crime can be an issue, as can city dysfunction. Though overall crime rates have decreased in the past few years and violent crimes are down nearly 20% since 2013, Oakland still has a relatively high crime rate: There were 6,169 violent crimes in 2015. The police department went through four police chiefs in a 10-day period last summer as a series of escalating sex scandals unfolded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oakland has experienced real-estate booms and busts before, and some real-estate experts express concern that the market is overheated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's definitely at a boiling point," says Javier Vivas, manager of economic research of Realtor.com. In terms of rapid price appreciation, "we don't really expect it to continue because we're quickly coming to a place where the locals are being priced out and when you look at income versus home prices it's not sustainable." He predicts price appreciation will likely taper off, though another all-out crash is unlikely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers seem undeterred. Signature Development Group will soon break ground on Brooklyn Basin, a 65-acre waterfront development that will include 3,100 apartments and condos, and 200,000-square-feet of shopping and offices, along with 33 acres of waterfront park space. Prices haven't yet been determined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Breaking ground next year, Oak Knoll will be a 187-acre master-planned community with 935 homes in the Oakland Hills. Station House, a development of 171 luxury townhomes on a roughly 8-acre former truck storage site in West Oakland, launched sales in October and has since sold more than one-third of the units. Prices range between mid-$600,000 and upper $800,000 for townhomes with open kitchens, optional wide-plank hardwood floors and solar power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phil Kerr, CEO of City Ventures Homebuilding, Station House's developer, says the company invested in Oakland partly because of the shifting job base. "Last time around the jobs were really based in Silicon Valley," he says. "This time, a lot of the creative jobs are in San Francisco or Oakland."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">West Oakland, the area geographically closest to San Francisco, has recently become an epicenter of the kind of change sweeping the city. Amidst the mix of charming old Victorian homes, vacant lots, and industrial and storage facilities, developers are renovating and building new homes targeted at buyers eager to be near public transit. The neighborhood's BART station is a seven-minute ride to downtown San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate developer Kathy Kuhner has been living in West Oakland since 1999. She and her daughter, Francesca Boyd, have 10 homes under construction. On a recent drive, the two pointed out several homes they had built and recently sold, and properties on nearly every block where renovation or construction was under way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October, they listed a property with concrete floors and 20-foot ceilings for $925,000 and sold it for $1.2 million. They had so many back-up offers, an adjacent home they built sold to another bidder for around the same price. "I thought people would come to Oakland and for many years, they didn't," says Ms. Kuhner. "And now it's like we're being discovered."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NORTH CAROLINA</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Repeal of Transgender</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bathroom Bill in Doubt</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The repeal of North Carolina's transgender bathroom bill was in question Wednesday, after the Charlotte, N.C., City Council met -- for the second time this week -- to reassure the state legislature that Charlotte will drop new LGBT protections if state lawmakers roll back the state's House Bill 2.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The legislature was to meet Wednesday to consider repeal of HB2, a state law requiring transgender people to use the public bathroom associated with the sex listed on their birth certificate. The law has prompted companies to cancel investments and sports leagues to cancel tournament games that were scheduled to be held in the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The liberal Charlotte council voted 7-2 in an emergency session to a full repeal of the city ordinance the council passed in February that prompted the Republican-led legislature to then pass HB2 in March. The council had met Monday on the same issue, in hopes of adhering to the terms of a behind-the-scenes deal with Democratic Governor-elect Roy Cooper and the GOP-led legislature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cooper, the Democrat who is to be inaugurated as governor on Jan. 1, said Monday that a deal was close. But social conservatives have defended the bathroom bill as common sense and it is unclear whether the legislature will vote this week to repeal the law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charlotte City Attorney Bob Hagemann said he had been questioned about whether Charlotte previously left other rules on the books that would keep transgender protections in place, adding that it was important to clear the air. "No attempt was made to hide anything or to deceive anybody," Mr. Hagemann said. "The state is the sovereign and we are not. We're not dumb enough to try and trick them or trap them."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Executions in 2016</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hit a 25-Year Low</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Georgia led the nation in executions this year, as the number of death sentences carried out in the U.S. fell to a 25-year low, according to capital punishment researchers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">States executed 20 inmates this year, according to the <span class="companylink">Death Penalty Information Center</span>. That is eight fewer than last year's total and a fraction of the modern record of 98 set in 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the first time since capital punishment was reinstated in 1976, Georgia carried out the most executions. It executed nine inmates, two more than Texas, which usually leads the nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2016, for the first time in four decades, no state imposed 10 or more death sentences, according to the center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five states put to death inmates this year, with Texas and Georgia together accounting for 80% of the executions. Not since 1983 have so few states carried out at least one death sentence. Since 2015, 85% of executions have taken place in three states: Texas, Georgia and Missouri.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline in Texas -- seven compared with 13 -- was mainly the result of Texas appeals judges granting more stays of executions due to prisoner claims related to faulty forensic science and prosecutorial misconduct and other issues. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has granted 15 stays since 2015, compared with the three it granted from 2012 to 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">State and federal court rulings striking down death-penalty sentencing procedures in several states also contributed to this year's decline.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-Home Sales</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rose in November</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-buying activity increased in November to the strongest sales pace in nearly a decade, though rising prices and mortgage rates could pressure the U.S. housing sector in the new year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of previously owned homes, which account for the vast majority of U.S. sales, edged up 0.7% from October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.61 million last month, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Wednesday. That was the third straight monthly rise, beating economists' expectations for a modest November decline, and the strongest sales rate since February 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But prices continued to rise as inventory stayed tight, crimping affordability for many would-be buyers as mortgage rates march higher. Those forces could depress sales as the spring buying season approaches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales in November rose 15.4% compared with November 2015. The annual gain was exaggerated by a one-off plunge in sales during November 2015 that the <span class="companylink">NAR</span> had blamed on new federal mortgages rules delaying closings.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the presidential election, economists anticipated the housing market would continue its steady recovery in 2017. Growth in home prices and sales likely would slow after a four-year run-up, but new construction likely would pick up, bringing relief to those struggling to find affordable homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most economists still hold to those predictions, but they now say Donald Trump's victory could upend the market. As investors bet on faster growth—tied to tax cuts and higher infrastructure spending—mortgage rates have risen to 4.16% from 3.54% before the election, figures from mortgage giant <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If rates continue to rise quickly, it could make it more difficult for new buyers to afford homes and create a disincentive for current owners to sell their homes and give up ultra-low-rate loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Changes to immigration policies under a Trump administration also could put a damper on the market by exacerbating a shortage of workers to build new homes and by reducing the number of new households being formed. "If you pull back on immigration, you pull back on housing," said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's Analytics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, economists said paring financial regulations—along with a stronger economy overall—could also give the housing market a lift.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, expects mortgage rates to rise to about 4.5% next year, which he said won't be enough to dampen demand. He expects the volume of existing home sales to increase slightly, by 1% to 2%, but said the pace could accelerate or turn negative depending on various policy changes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Under a Trump presidency, he relishes unpredictability so there is a wide variance in the forecast outlook," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide Insurance, expects home-price growth to slow slightly to 4.8% from about 5.3% this year. Next year he expects conventional 30-year fixed-rate mortgages to rise to 4.65%, which won't be enough to hurt the market. But by 2018, rates could start crimping demand, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Rates can rise by enough to choke off the housing market," Mr. Berson said. "I think we're still a long way from that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zandi expects housing starts to rise to 1.4 million from about 1.2 million this year, an important boost to a market starved for new supply.</p>

Lennar Expects Housing Recovery to Continue Despite Rising Interest Rates; Home builder's revenue grows 15% to $3.38 billion</span>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builder Lennar Corp. posted another quarter of key metric gains as the U.S. housing market continues to recover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company also said that it expects the incoming Trump administration to "focusing on accelerating economic growth."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> warned that it would face rising interest rates in the coming years. The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> decided to raise the federal-funds target rate[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/fed-raises-rates-for-first-time-in-2016-anticipates-3-increases-in-2017-1481742086] by a quarter of a percentage point last week, which means borrowing will get more expensive for consumers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chief Executive Stuart Miller said the housing market continues a "slow and steady recovery."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gross margin on home sales fell to 23.3% from 24.6% on rising land and construction costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number and average price of homes delivered rose in the quarter, driving revenue growth. The number of deliveries rose 7.5% for the fourth quarter from a year before as the average price of a delivered home increased 2.6% to $358,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of new orders increased 9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent quarters, the company's results had been hurt by its Houston segment, whose large energy sector has been challenged by low energy prices in recent quarters. The company said that unit would be reported as part of its larger Homebuilding Central segment as it no longer meets the criteria for separate reporting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Lennar</span> reported a quarterly profit of $313.5 million, or $1.34 a share, up from $281.6 million, or $1.21 a share, a year prior. Analysts polled by <span class="companylink">Thomson Reuters</span> projected $1.28 in per-share profit</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue grew 15% to $3.38 billion.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markets started the last week before Christmas on a subdued note, with stock moves muted and government bonds stabilizing after steep declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Stoxx Europe 600 edged down 0.1% late morning, after Japanese stocks snapped a nine-session winning streak. Futures pointed to a less than 0.2% opening gain for the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average, roughly on track to reverse Friday's losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a striking postelection rally sent Wall Street to record highs last week, most investors see few catalysts left to trigger big moves ahead of the holidays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I really don't see a reason for a big correction before Inauguration Day, but I also don't see much potential for upside," said Tony Roth, chief investment officer at Wilmington Trust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When we talk to business leaders, we're seeing a degree of optimism we haven't seen in a long time... but it's somewhat surprising the market is not more cautious," he said, given the potential for U.S. fiscal policy to disappoint next year or for a strengthening dollar to hurt shares of exporters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The WSJ Dollar Index was last flat after rising sharply last week when the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> raised interest rates for the first time in a year and signaled a faster-than-expected pace of rate increases[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/fed-raises-rates-for-first-time-in-2016-anticipates-3-increases-in-2017-1481742086] in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts pointed to concern about escalating tensions between the U.S. and China as a factor weighing on the dollar Monday, as the fallout over China's seizure of an American underwater drone continued[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/tensions-linger-over-seizure-of-survey-drone-in-south-china-sea-1482086615] even after both countries said China would return the device.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar was down 0.4% against the yen after rising over 14% against the Japanese currency in six straight weeks of gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro was little changed on Monday, even after data showed German business sentiment improved in December to its highest level since February 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mining companies led declines in European stock markets as metals prices fell. Copper futures were down 1.3% at $5,568 a ton, while Chinese iron-ore futures dropped sharply in a move analysts attributed to a growing stockpile and Beijing's latest calls to curb asset bubbles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European bank stocks were also under pressure, with shares of troubled Italian lender <span class="companylink">Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena</span> down nearly 8% after initially failing to open in the first day of a share sale[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/monte-dei-paschi-set-to-launch-share-sale-1482073706]. The bank needs to raise about €5 billion ($5.23 billion) by the end of the year to avoid being nationalized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government bonds stabilized on Monday, meanwhile, after rising sharply last week[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/selloff-of-u-s-government-bonds-eases-1481902090]. Yields on 10-year German bunds and U.S. Treasurys were down slightly at 0.315% and 2.587% respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">U.S. Treasury</span> yields had settled at 2.600% on Friday, the highest in over two years, amid expectations of higher interest rates and signs inflation might be starting to creep up. Inflation chips away at bonds' fixed returns over time, reducing their attractiveness to investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said Friday that the climb in bond yields since the election indicates the need for a rate rise in 2017[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/feds-bullard-now-sees-need-for-additional-rate-increase-next-year-1481914297].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The real rate going up on the order of 25, 30 basis points, we did take that on board and we think that's important," Mr. Bullard said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen is expected to deliver a speech on the state of the job market later Monday, just days after the bank's final meeting of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier, markets in Asia mostly ended slightly lower. The Shanghai Composite Index was off 0.2% as a sharp selloff in Chinese government bonds raised concerns money is exiting the country's capital markets. Signs of a slowdown in China's property market also weighed on sentiment as data showed the growth of housing prices decelerated sharply in November. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index shed 0.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markets in Japan ended down 0.1% as the yen strengthened, just one day ahead of the conclusion of the <span class="companylink">Bank of Japan</span>'s final meeting of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Australian stocks advanced 0.5%, however, as gains in oil prices boosted the energy sector. Brent crude was last up 0.6% at $55.53 a barrel.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. unemployment is hovering near the lowest level in a decade, jobless claims have reached a 43-year low and home prices have surged to records. But in this eighth year of economic expansion, the number of single-family homes under construction remains at recessionary levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts dropped 18.7% in November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.090 million, the Commerce Department said Friday. Permits, an indication of how much construction is in the pipeline, were down a milder 4.7% to 1.201 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monthly housing figures are choppy, but the broader trend has been one of slow growth. New single-family home construction has more than doubled to a rate of 828,000 homes in November after bottoming at 353,000 in early 2009, but overall activity remains muted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adjusting for population growth, single-family construction is barely back to the prior troughs of recessions in 1981 and 1991, according to research from mortgage giant <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>. Even October's monthly readings, which showed single-family starts at the highest level in nine years, were more than 15% below long-run averages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sparse construction of new houses remains one of the enduring legacies of the housing bust and is one of the biggest impediments to achieving a more balanced recovery, economists said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People have said to us on many occasions that housing is back to normal," said Doug Duncan, the chief economist at Fannie Mae. "It's definitely not normal from a supply perspective."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The industry's inner workings broke down during the housing crash of the last decade and haven't fully recovered. Builders have faced difficulties finding skilled construction labor, while financing has been difficult for smaller builders and land developers. What's more, younger buyers remain on the sidelines, prompting builders to focus on a smaller group of upmarket buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said most of the home price appreciation since the market bottomed in 2012 has been driven by low supply rather than booming demand. In August, the ratio of existing homes for sale compared with total U.S. households dropped to the lowest level since the data were consistently tracked starting in 1999, according to an analysis of data from the Census and the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> by real estate tracker <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family housing starts in November, which have accounted for about two-thirds of all residential building activity since the recession ended, slid 4.1% to 828,000. They peaked at more than 1.82 million in 2006, the height of the housing bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales also have been slower than usual at this point in an economic recovery. The current level of resale transactions, adjusted for population, is about 10% below the level recorded from 1999 to 2003, before the onset of the housing bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For prospective home buyers, poor job prospects kept young people on the sidelines throughout the recession, while ballooning student debt and tight mortgage-lending standards have presented stiff headwinds since. A study by the <span class="companylink">Pew Research Center</span> this week found that 72% of renters said they would like to buy a home in the future, but mortgage applications are down sharply. Many of those prospective buyers assume they won't be able to qualify for a loan and don't apply, according to Pew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, household formation, a key driver of housing demand, has been muted as millions of younger Americans double up with friends or family instead. The number of young adults under age 30 has increased by about 5 million over the last 10 years, but the number of households for that age group increased by only 200,000 over the same period, according to the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If those young adults formed households at the same rate as in 2005, there would be about 1.7 million more households under 30 today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Builders have been quite keyed in on the fact that household formation has been really lagging," said William Wheaton, an economics and real estate professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders have also faced a series of constraints that have affected the pace of production, particularly at lower price points. Tighter lending restrictions after the crisis made it difficult for smaller private operators to access capital. The downturn in home construction also depleted the pool of construction labor. Local building restrictions have added to the cost of building so-called starter homes in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The costs don't really work for the kind of housing that we need, especially for first-time buyers," said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Realtor.com. <span class="companylink">News Corp</span>, owner of The Wall Street Journal, also operates Realtor.com under license from the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the increased costs, Doug Bauer, chief executive of the national builder Tri Pointe Group, is bullish on housing growth because of the demographic wave of potential millennial buyers. "They've got to live somewhere," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—U.S. housing starts tumbled in November but remained at a level suggesting steady demand for single-family homes amid low interest rates and steady job creation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts dropped 18.7% in November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.090 million[http://www.census.gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf], the Commerce Department said Friday. Permits, an indication of how much construction is in the pipeline, were down a milder 4.7% to 1.201 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected November starts to fall to 1.23 million and permits to register at 1.24 million. Construction typically begins a month or two after a permit is issued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop-off follows an especially strong October, which registered the highest number of overall starts since July 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family housing starts, which have accounted for about two-thirds of all activity since the recession ended, slid 4.1% to 828,000. They peaked at more than 1.82 million in 2006, the height of the housing bubble. Single-family permits rose 0.5% to 778,000, the highest level since November 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starts on structures with two or more units, which include apartments and condominiums, plummeted 45.1%. Permits sank 13.0%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monthly housing figures are choppy, have a significant margin of error and can be subject to large revisions. But the broader trend has been one of slow growth amid rising demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">November's three-month moving average of single-family starts, which smooths out some of the monthly volatility, registered at the highest level since the end of 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, construction hasn't fully recovered since the housing bust, leading to a limited supply of new and existing homes for sale. That's pushed prices higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> last month said existing-home sales accelerated to the fastest pace in almost a decade[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-highest-since-february-2007-1479827703] even as prices have been rising faster than most Americans incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates, meanwhile, have started to climb, potentially making homes less affordable. A 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 4.16% for the week ending Dec. 15, up from 3.97% a year earlier and a 2016 low of 3.41% reached in July, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was before the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> on Wednesday decided to raise short-term rates for only the second time in a decade[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/fed-raises-rates-for-first-time-in-2016-anticipates-3-increases-in-2017-1481742086] amid rising optimism about the U.S. economy[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/livecoverage/federal-reserve-december-meeting].</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While I commend Sen. Dan Sullivan for his efforts to make project construction easier ("Putting America's Building Permits on a Fast Track," op-ed, Dec. 6), why is the only way elected officials know to correct a problem to pass another law? Perhaps an easier answer is to simply revise the permitting process regulations by requiring that the <span class="companylink">EPA</span> and any other department demanding a special study to allow permitting be required to demonstrate a specific, logical reason for the study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The automatic requirement to spend millions of dollars and waste years of time on studies and reviews does little or nothing to "protect" the environment but adds tremendous cost and delay to needed projects. Somehow, before America had the <span class="companylink">EPA</span>, we managed to develop an entire country without destroying the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jack Hamilton</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Silverdale, Wa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sen. Sullivan's Rebuild America Now Act not only would revitalize America's deteriorating infrastructure, it would also galvanize another vital sector of the economy -- home building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home building is one of the most heavily regulated industries in America. On average, nearly 25% of the cost of a single-family home is attributable to government regulation. Federal permits, in particular, can account for a large portion of the regulatory burdens home builders face. For example, home builders must often obtain Clean Water Act Section 402 permits for storm water runoff and Section 404 wetland permits for actions that result in discharge of dredged or fill materials into federally protected waters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By easing federal permitting burdens, Sen. Sullivan's Act will help to provide much-needed housing to spur job and economic growth.</p>

A study[http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2016/12/15/in-a-recovering-market-homeownership-rates-are-down-sharply-for-blacks-young-adults/] by the <span class="companylink">Pew Research Center</span> released Thursday found that homeownership rates since the peak in 2004 are down across the board. But while the rate among white households has fallen 5%, it has fallen 16% for African-American households.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rate among households age 65 and up has fallen just 3%, compared with 18% for those younger than 35.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, the homeownership rate hit a more-than 50-year low in July, although it has since edged higher. That number reflects a growing population of senior citizens who continue to own homes in much greater numbers than their younger counterparts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Today's homeownership rate is being propped up by an aging society," said Richard Fry, a senior economist at the Pew Research Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices jumped 5.5% in September compared with a year earlier, according to the S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index. That was good news for homeowners, many of whom are nearing retirement age and ready to cash out on the appreciation of the past few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as prices rise, homes are slipping further out of reach for younger and minority buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pew found that 72% of renters said they would like to buy in the future, but mortgage applications are down significantly. The falloff has been greatest among African-American and Hispanic borrowers, according to Pew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Applications for home loans among whites tumbled 45% from 2004 to 2015, but plunged 77% among blacks and 76% for Hispanics, according to Pew. At the same time, the share of loan applications that were approved rose to 71% from 64%, likely reflecting stronger applicant pools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deterred by the lack of down-payment money or less-than-pristine credit, it appears many of these households assume they won't be able to get a loan and don't bother applying, according to Pew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tightening of credit to reduce default risk has had the unintended consequence of excluding more minorities from homeownership. In 2004, 32% of loans to African-American borrowers were subprime, while in 2015 only 7% of them were, according to Pew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That's not to say that returning to the standards of 2003 [or] 2006 is appropriate," Mr. Fry said. "It may be that banks can make successful loans to buyers with less-than-stellar credit histories."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While I commend Sen. Dan Sullivan for his efforts to make project construction easier ("How to Put Building Permits on a Fast Track[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/how-to-put-building-permits-on-a-fast-track-1480886263]," op-ed, Dec. 5), why is the only way elected officials know to correct a problem to pass another law? Perhaps an easier answer is to simply revise the permitting process regulations by requiring that the <span class="companylink">EPA</span> and any other department demanding a special study to allow permitting be required to demonstrate a specific, logical reason for the study. The automatic requirement to spend millions of dollars and waste years of time on studies and reviews does little or nothing to "protect" the environment but adds tremendous cost and delay to needed projects. Somehow, before we had the <span class="companylink">EPA</span>, we managed to develop an entire country without destroying the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"> Maybe it is time to get back to "best engineering practices" as the baseline for our infrastructure projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jack Hamilton</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Silverdale, Wa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sen. Sullivan's Rebuild America Now Act not only would revitalize our nation's deteriorating infrastructure, it would also galvanize another vital sector of the economy—home building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home building is one of the most heavily regulated industries in America. On average, nearly 25% of the cost of a single-family home is attributable to government regulation. Federal permits, in particular, can account for a large portion of the regulatory burdens home builders face. For example, home builders must often obtain Clean Water Act Section 402 permits for storm water runoff and Section 404 wetland permits for actions that result in discharge of dredged or fill materials into federally protected waters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additionally, permitting costs and delays translate into higher housing costs for home buyers and renters. By easing federal permitting burdens, Sen. Sullivan's Rebuild America Now Act will help to provide much-needed housing to spur job and economic growth.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When home-price growth outpaces rent growth, that can be a sign of a bubble because it indicates people are paying more than necessary merely to find a place to live[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/lopsided-housing-rebound-leaves-millions-of-people-out-in-the-cold-1470852996]. During the housing bubble of the mid-2000s, easy mortgages fueled a run-up in prices and encouraged people to buy who would have been financially better off renting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no indication that is happening this time, but in a few key markets the index is moving into alarming territory. In Dallas, Denver and Houston, renting is the most favorable it has been in the history of the index, suggesting significantly overheated housing markets there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All three cities are likely to see flat home-price growth and slow-moving inventory in the coming years, Mr. Johnson said, though he thinks a collapse is unlikely given that prices are still nowhere near as inflated as many cities experienced during the boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Los Angeles, New York and Philadelphia all are metro areas where it still makes sense to buy, according to the index.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> reported adjusted pretax income up 23% to $292 million on revenue up 29% to $1.86 billion in fourth quarter results released yesterday, topping market estimates for the fifth straight quarter. Management was optimistic for continued growth in revenue and profit in 2017, but it also acknowledged continuing margin pressure and pockets of weaker sales persisting in key markets. And Toll's quarter closed Oct. 31—more than a week before the shocking results of the presidential election signaled a potentially more sobering outlook for the homebuilding sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">about the author</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vicki Bryan has 30 years of experience in the investment industry with 22 years covering high yield and distressed companies across a broad variety of industries. She was an independent management consultant advising in financial and operational strategies to distressed and emerging growth companies and a partner, vice president, and senior analyst with AIM Investment Management. Bryan earned her M.S. in finance from <span class="companylink">University of Houston</span>, where she also was an adjunct professor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue growth was broad-based across all markets, with deliveries up 22% overall. Orders were up 20% and backlog was up 15%, and the cancellation rate dipped to 4.9% versus the industry low 5.5% last year. But pressure was also in evidence, signaled by flat to lower regional pricing year/year and/or sequentially, as well as faltering profitability. Adjusted gross margin fell another 260 bps to 24.9% and Ebitda margin was down 140 bps to 16.65%. Similarly, results for the year looked good with Ebitda up 19% to $911 million on revenue up 24% to $5.17 billion and leverage eased to 4.1 times versus 5 times in 2015. However, adjusted gross margin was down 100 bps to 25.6% and Ebitda margin was down another 70 bps to 17.6%. Weaker pricing trends seemed to confirm that even Toll is experiencing softening demand strength we have been tracking across the sector, and weaker pricing power not able to overcome ever rising direct costs for building materials and labor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Management nevertheless maintained an optimistic outlook through 2017, confident in its strong brand and enviable niche in the "sweet spot" as a more affordable luxury builder with prices averaging roughly $700,000 to $900,000 (versus much higher "super luxury") and notably limited competition in a highly fragmented segment. Toll also remains confident in a steady stream of "financially strong buyers," including the surge in affluent millennials which contributed more than 20% of sales this quarter. That may have been true before, but now we have a bombastic new administration waiting in the wings which already has upended previous expectations for business prospects. Existing home sales have remained tepid even before the election and more recent indications signal softening trends—bad news for Toll's buyers who need to sell their homes. Mortgage applications also have been in sharp decline since September until after the election, chilled by the sharp spike in mortgage interest rates with the bond market sell-off triggered by the election results, followed by a surge in the past couple of weeks which we think looks like demand drawn forward to lock in rates on existing orders ahead of further rate increases. Indeed, we are concerned that demand will stall. Recall that we long have maintained that home builders have relied most on aggressive home pricing since 2012 to generate revenue growth, even when it dampened sales, a strategy facilitated by a profoundly low mortgage interest rate environment near 50-year lows which could be ending. The dramatic, erratic, and likely protracted uncertainty already evident with this administration seems more likely to spike risk and impair economic growth, which could stall nascent wage growth and reverse job growth. If so already fragile home demand could sputter. With faltering affordability on new homes plus further pressure on income and jobs we expect the already modest momentum in housing market sales could stall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And despite Toll's expressed optimism, pricing trends were markedly lower in most markets versus the third quarter and one can drive a truck through its guided ranges projected for 2017 deliveries, pricing, and total revenue which imply tepid to lower trends overall. First-quarter revenue is projected up 5% to down nearly 20%—and that's including the acquisition of Coleman homes which closed in November and which also is expected to dilute gross margin by 30 bps to 40 bps. Pricing is projected down 3% to up 20%, again boosted by acquisitions, community count, deliveries up 9% to 26%, and pricing down 3% to 8%—gross margin is expected to fall another 25 bps to 35 bps. If our more troubling outlook begins to take shape it's possible Toll may see lower than expected sales trends as soon as the first quarter, with cancellation rates creeping higher on faltering order and backlog trends. We now estimate 2017 revenue near $5.7 billion (up 10%, boosted by acquisitions and community count up 6%) with Ebitda near $940 million (up 3%, 16.6% margin down 100 bps), free cash flow near $140 million (up 3%) short of covering $90 million in acquisitions and $200 million in stock repurchases, and leverage climbing to 4.1 times after additional leverage to cover the cash shortfall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prior to the election Toll's bonds due in 2022-2025 were up 1 to 3 points versus August, when they were trading near 102.6 to 109.6 (3.8% to 4.4% ytw). Now the bonds are flat to down 5 points versus August to 99.7 to 109.2 (3.8% to 5.1% ytw). However, spreads actually have tightened to just 50 bps to 65 bps per turn of leverage. Given this meager compensation and our expectation of Toll's waning margins and credit quality, we now rate the bonds "underperform" from "outperform."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto   </div><div>578 words</div><div>12 December 2016</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising interest rates pose a dilemma for people who love their mortgage more than they hate their house: A sustained period of rising rates could freeze homeowners with rock-bottom mortgages who otherwise might want to trade up for bigger or better properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such situations, which economists call "rate lock," could weigh on housing demand in 2017, economists said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A seven-year run of historically low mortgage rates has encouraged home buying, helping increase prices sharply after the housing crash. The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index hit a record in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But mortgage rates have jumped more than half a percentage point since the election, and economists are bracing for higher rates in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That gives homeowners incentive to remain in place rather than trade up, said Nela Richardson, chief economist at real-estate brokerage firm Redfin. "It doesn't take much to turn off the faucet in this market because inventory is so low and prices have gone up so quickly," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to 4.13% on Thursday, according to mortgage company <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, up from 3.54% before the election. That was the highest level since October 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest bump boosts the monthly cost of owning the typical U.S. home by more than $70 a month, or about $26,000 over the life of a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, according to <span class="companylink">Black Knight Financial Services</span>, a mortgage and real estate technology and data provider.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In California, where the median-priced home is closer to $500,000, homeowners already are looking at paying about $170 more a month based on the recent rate rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Zillow, a typical household in Los Angeles already spends 38% of its income on mortgage payments -- greater than the recommended 30%. In the Bay Area, about 5% fewer households will fall under the recommended 33% debt-to-income ratio to afford a $1 million mortgage if interest rates rise from 4% to 5%, according to Selma Hepp, chief economist at Pacific Union International, a real-estate firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, about 66% of U.S. homeowners with mortgages have rates of less than 4.5%, according to real estate analytics firm <span class="companylink">CoreLogic Inc</span>. Economists said rates would likely need to rise above 5% for a large number of homeowners across the U.S. to face the rate lock dilemma.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the economy has shown signs of strengthening, the <span class="companylink">U.S. Federal Reserve</span> is expected to raise short-term interest rates when it meets this week. Mortgage rates are tied more closely to Treasury bond yields, which also tend to rise during periods of inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates have risen because the economy is strengthening and investors are betting that tax cuts and increased government spending on infrastructure will spur more growth. Higher wage growth could offset the effect of higher mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeanette Mateo, a 41-year-old health-care project coordinator in Sacramento, Calif., said if rates rise it could affect her decision to sell. She and her partner already agreed once to sell their house but pulled out of the deal "10 or 15 minutes later" because they were nervous about being able to find another one they could afford.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I suspect it's already having an impact at the margin. Another half a percent and the impact will be substantial," said Lou Barnes, a capital markets analyst at Boulder-based Premier Mortgage Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners in pricey coastal markets, where affordability is already strained, could feel the pinch sooner. In California, where the median-priced home is closer to $500,000, homeowners already are looking at paying about $170 more a month based on the recent rate rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Zillow, a typical household in Los Angeles already spends 38% of its income on mortgage payments—greater than the recommended 30%.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists expect mortgage rates to continue rising gradually from here, though such predictions have been wrong before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates have risen because the economy is strengthening and investors are betting that tax cuts and increased government spending on infrastructure will spur more growth. Higher wage growth could offset the effect of higher mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the fact that so many homeowners enjoy such low rates could also prove an economic brake, creating a disincentive for homeowners to move to a new city in pursuit of a new job if it means their mortgage might be more expensive, said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide Insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent history suggests the impact of rising rates can be swift and substantial. In 2013 mortgage rates surged to 4.5% from 3.6% as investors anticipated the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> would pull back from its bond-buying program. The pace of sales of previously owned homes declined 8% from July to December of that year, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rate of home-price increases around that time was cut essentially in half, to 5% from 9%, according to Black Knight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If 2013 is any guide, we could expect to see a slowdown in [price] appreciation," said Ben Graboske, vice president of Black Knight's data and analytics division. "We still think house prices will grow, just more meekly."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeanette Mateo, a 41-year-old health-care project coordinator in Sacramento, Calif., said if rates rise it could affect her decision to sell. She and her partner already agreed once to sell their house but pulled out of the deal "10 or 15 minutes later" because they were nervous about being able to find another one they could afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They pay about $900 a month on their mortgage, which they refinanced in 2009 when rates were around 5%. Now they are eyeing a home in a new development, which would give them a bigger kitchen and an extra garage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Mateo said if rates rise significantly they might not be able to afford to trade up, and they worry that it would be more difficult to sell if some buyers are scared off.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Chris Kirkham </div><div>672 words</div><div>9 December 2016</div><div>09:08</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of luxury homes in most parts of the U.S. have continued to increase over the last year, according to an analysis of more than 40 high-end counties in 16 states, despite concerns from some analysts about a slowdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study, by research firm <span class="companylink">John Burns Real Estate Consulting</span>, showed that the number of homes priced above $600,000 grew in 37 out of 43 counties analyzed and that sales above that threshold in the last 12 months increased by more than 10% over the previous year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's been this notion that luxury is in a recession," said John Burns, the group's chief executive. "What's slowing and getting a lot of headlines are the $5 million homes and the $8 million homes." For homes priced below those ultraluxury levels but still far above median prices, demand has remained strong, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data show that growth might have slowed as the year has progressed. While sales over $600,000 increased by 10% across all 43 markets when examining the last 12 months, the growth rate was 5% when looking at sales in the third quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, sales for the third quarter increased year-over-year for homes in every price range up the scale. Sales of homes between $1 million and $1.1 million grew by 4%, those between $1.1 million and $1.2 million grew by 10% and those $1.5 million and above edged 1% higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What constitutes luxury, of course, isn't the same in every market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes above $600,000 would be considered high-end in Fulton County, Ga., where the median price is about $228,000. But in San Francisco, median home prices are above $1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the most expensive markets, the results were mixed. Sales of homes above $1.5 million in Alameda County, Calif., home to Oakland, grew by 20% in the third quarter, and sales in that price range grew by 30% in Brooklyn, N.Y., over the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But sales above $1.5 million in Manhattan fell by 10% in the third quarter compared with a year earlier, and sales in Santa Clara County, Calif.—home to Silicon Valley—fell by 11% in that time frame. The analysis, using <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> data, focused on large markets where new home construction is high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Burns attributed some of the slowdown in luxury homes in Manhattan and Miami to a decrease in foreign-buyer sales after the Treasury Department required more disclosure of buyers' names in all-cash property transactions involving limited liability companies. The initiative started in Manhattan and Miami in January and expanded over the summer to other markets, including parts of coastal California, the rest of New York City, counties near Miami and San Antonio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In less pricey markets around the country, however, higher-end sales have remained strong. In Denver, sales above $600,000 increased by 32% overall in the third quarter, and sales above $600,000 in El Dorado County, Calif., outside Sacramento, grew by 31% for the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend was on display this week when luxury national home builder Toll Brothers Inc. again reported double-digit revenue growth and projected a rosy 2017 despite analysts' concerns about a high-end slowdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While there has been some debate about softness in the luxury housing market, we continue to produce impressive results by serving what we believe is a demographic sweet spot in the luxury market," Toll Brothers' Chief Executive Douglas Yearley said on an earnings call, noting the company has an average sales price of about $690,000 in markets outside of California and New York. "Our product lines are affordable to many households in the U.S."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Robyn A. Friedman   </div><div>433 words</div><div>9 December 2016</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's your home worth? Not quite as much as you might think.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The final sale price of single-family homes in northern Illinois has been 17% under the homeowners' initial asking price, according to an analysis by Re/Max, a national brokerage with offices in northern Illinois.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owners of attached homes -- a category that includes apartments, row houses, townhomes and condos -- have been more realistic in their list prices. These properties have sold for 4% below their initial asking price so far this year, Re/Max research shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The analysis covered listings this year, through October, in seven counties -- Cook, DuPage, Kane, Kendall, Lake, McHenry and Will -- of homes in the MRED (Midwest Real Estate Data) database.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Millennial home buyers, those born between 1982 and 2004, are eager to live in Chicago and are thus the most likely to purchase property closer to the initial listing price than older buyers who are house-hunting for high-end homes in the suburbs, said Jack Kreider, executive vice president of Re/Max Northern Illinois.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's strong demand in the city and a limited inventory, and it's creating a perfect storm for sellers to get close to their listing price, or over," Mr. Kreider said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both single-family and attached homes have sold at prices much closer to their listing prices so far in 2016 than they did in the same period in 2013. Three years ago, single-family homes traded for an average of 25% under their initial listing price, while attached homes sold for an average of 17% under, Re/Max found. "There was a bigger supply then," Mr. Kreider said of the 2013 data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because inventory in Chicago is low, homes in some neighborhoods are currently selling at or above their listing prices, said Tom Brandt, a broker with Keller Williams in Park Ridge, Ill. He recently listed a two-bedroom, one-bath house in the city's Irving Park neighborhood for $300,000 and received eight offers the next day. One was for $352,000, but since the sellers knew the house wouldn't be appraised for that amount by the lender, they agreed on $325,000, or 108.33% of the listing price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You truly get the highest and best value when a house is priced appropriately," Mr. Brandt said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEIJING—<span class="companylink">Foxconn Technology</span> Group, which manufactures <span class="companylink">Apple Inc</span> .'s iPhone and other products, said it is in talks to expand in the U.S. The statement comes amid President-elect Donald Trump's push for a return of manufacturing [http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/trump-warns-another-u-s-company-1480899497] to the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foxconn said the size and scope of its potential U.S. investment hasn't been determined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We can confirm that we are in preliminary discussions regarding a potential investment that would represent an expansion of our current U.S. operations," the Taiwanese electronics manufacturer formally known as <span class="companylink">Hon Hai Precision Industry Co</span> . said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foxconn's core business is electronics assembly, and <span class="companylink">Apple</span> its biggest customer. During his campaign, Mr. Trump vowed that as president he would "get <span class="companylink">Apple</span> to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other countries."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A small share of <span class="companylink">Apple</span> 's products are already made in the U.S. by other contract manufacturers. Flex Ltd. makes Mac computers in Austin, Texas, and <span class="companylink">Quanta Computer Inc</span> . produces Macs in Fremont, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overwhelming majority of <span class="companylink">Apple</span> products are assembled in China, however, primarily by Foxconn, which employs hundreds of thousands of workers in its Chinese factories. Foxconn and another two other contractors, <span class="companylink">Pegatron Corp</span> . and <span class="companylink">Wistron Corp</span> ., assemble iPhones across six factories in China, as well as one in Brazil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shortly after the election, Mr. Trump received a call from Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook , Mr. Trump told The <span class="companylink">New York Times</span> . Time magazine, which named Mr. Trump its Person of the Year for 2016, quoted him in an interview published Wednesday as saying he told Mr. Cook that he wants "to get <span class="companylink">Apple</span> to build a great plant, your biggest and your best, even if it's only a foot by a foot bigger than some place in China."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It isn't clear that any Foxconn expansion in the U.S. would be to make <span class="companylink">Apple</span> products, however. Foxconn has been investing in diverse high-tech sectors [http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/taiwans-foxconn-invests-in-chinas-ride-hailing-startup-didi-chuxing-1473334404] including robotics, e-commerce, consumer-tech startups and health care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foxconn's statement came a day after Japan's SoftBank Group Corp. Chief Executive Masayoshi Son met with Mr. Trump in New York [http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/donald-trump-says-softbank-pledges-to-invest-50-billion-in-u-s-1481053732] and pledged to invest $50 billion in the U.S.That money will be coming from a $100 billion investment fund that Mr. Son began setting up earlier this year with Saudi Arabia's sovereign-wealth fund and other potential partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foxconn's logo appeared beside SoftBank's on the piece of paper that Mr. Son held while speaking to reporters after his meeting with Mr. Trump. It wasn't clear how Foxconn might be involved in Mr. Son's plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Son and Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou are longtime friends. <span class="companylink">SoftBank</span> and Foxconn have collaborated on several investments, including on a joint venture last year with <span class="companylink">Alibaba Group Holding Ltd</span> . to sell the Japanese company's humanoid robot [http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/pepper-softbanks-emotional-robot-goes-global-1434618111], Pepper.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foxconn has talked before about investing in factories in the U.S., where it also has logistics and R&amp;D operations.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's your home worth? Not quite as much as you might think[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/more-luxury-home-sellers-drop-their-asking-prices-1460471257].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The final sale price of single-family homes in northern Illinois has been 17% under the homeowners' initial asking price, according to an analysis by Re/Max, a national brokerage with offices in northern Illinois.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owners of attached homes—a category that includes apartments, row houses, townhomes and condos—have been more realistic in their list prices. These properties have sold for 4% below their initial asking price so far this year, Re/Max research shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The analysis covered listings this year, through October, in seven counties—Cook, DuPage, Kane, Kendall, Lake, McHenry and Will—of homes in the MRED (Midwest Real Estate Data) database.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Millennial home buyers, those born between 1982 and 2004, are eager to live in Chicago and are thus the most likely to purchase property closer to the initial listing price than older buyers who are house-hunting for high-end homes in the suburbs[http://blogs.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/economics/2016/03/24/more-americans-are-again-moving-to-suburbs-than-cities/], said Jack Kreider, executive vice president of Re/Max Northern Illinois.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's strong demand in the city and a limited inventory, and it's creating a perfect storm for sellers to get close to their listing price, or over," Mr. Kreider said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both single-family and attached homes have sold at prices much closer to their listing prices so far in 2016 than they did in the same period in 2013. Three years ago, single-family homes traded for an average of 25% under their initial listing price, while attached homes sold for an average of 17% under, Re/Max found. "There was a bigger supply then," Mr. Kreider said of the 2013 data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because inventory in Chicago is low, homes in some neighborhoods are currently selling at or above their listing prices, said Tom Brandt, a broker with Keller Williams in Park Ridge, Ill. He recently listed a two-bedroom, one-bath house in the city's Irving Park neighborhood for $300,000 and received eight offers the next day. One was for $352,000, but since the sellers knew the house wouldn't be appraised for that amount by the lender, they agreed on $325,000, or 108.33% of the listing price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You truly get the highest and best value when a house is priced appropriately," Mr. Brandt said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Lingling Wei </div><div>1642 words</div><div>7 December 2016</div><div>14:13</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2014, the Chinese city of Haimen on the mouth of the Yangtze River set out to build a large apartment complex and turned to <span class="companylink">Bank of Nanjing Co</span>. for about $29 million in financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank was happy to oblige but it didn't call the money a loan, according to people familiar with the matter. It was added to Bank of Nanjing's balance sheet as an "investment receivable," a loosely regulated category of assets that allows bank officials to set aside little or nothing for potential losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank officials aren't shy about the accounting sleight of hand, which is rampant across China. The bank had about $39 billion in investment receivables in the third quarter, nearly as big as its loan portfolio, and profits have climbed by more than 20% a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of June, 32 publicly traded Chinese banks had a total of $2 trillion in investment receivables as of June, up from $334 billion at the end of 2011, according to a tally by The Wall Street Journal of the latest available information from data provider Wind Information Co.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The investments are equivalent to 20% of the same banks' total loans in dollar terms, up from 6% at the end of 2011. The 32 banks have about 70% of all the banking assets in China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surge shows how Chinese banks are trying to keep the credit spigot open to support the country's slowing economy. Structuring financing deals as investments instead of loans frees up bank capital and makes it easier to extend loan deadlines or new credit to borrowers. The strategy has been especially popular at small and midsize banks, said executives and analysts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The epidemic of investment receivables has created a parallel buildup of debt in addition to China's rising official debt levels, now 2½ times gross domestic product. "The rapid growth in banks' off-balance-sheet and investment activities, in essence, means hidden credit risks and could threaten financial safety," said Shang Fulin, China's top banking regulator, in an unusually blunt speech in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists at Swiss bank <span class="companylink">UBS AG</span> estimate as much as $2.4 trillion (16.5 trillion yuan) was "missing" from the broadest measurement of credit disclosed by <span class="companylink">China's central bank</span> last year, up from $712 billion (4.9 trillion yuan) in 2014. The discrepancy is largely because Chinese commercial banks use so-called shadow lenders to mask loans as investments, the economists said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November, China's top banking regulatory agency proposed rules that could force financial institutions[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/china-regulators-issue-new-draft-rules-to-curb-shadow-banking-1479904905] like Bank of Nanjing to apply more-stringent accounting standards to investments that are essentially loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, though, authorities have been reluctant to come down too hard, fearing it could jolt the country's financial system. In 2013, the <span class="companylink">People's Bank of China</span> set off a cash crunch by tightening liquidity in the interbank market where banks and other financial institutions borrow from each other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central bank was trying to rein in shadow lending but left some commercial banks and nonbank lenders in a desperate scramble for funding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Chinese banks were required to count their investment receivables as loans, the banks would need to raise as much as $212 billion in capital, estimates UBS analyst Jason Bedford. That is not far short of the $262 billion raised by all Chinese banks in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, the analyst said, "we expect any capital impact [on banks] to be dragged out over years to avoid a shock to the system."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some banks are showing new signs of restraint. Investment receivables at 24 banks that have released third-quarter results totaled about $1.6 trillion, barely changed from June 30, according to the Journal's tally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the advantages of the strategy remain hard for bankers to resist. Turning loans into investments has helped Chinese banks continue funding troubled customers, including property developers with too much inventory and deeply indebted financing companies set up by local governments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, nearly 90% of the loan-like investments created by Bank of Luoyang Co. and shadow lenders were used to finance real-estate developments, according to a June report by China Chengxin International Credit Rating Co., one of China's top ratings firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the projects were concentrated in Zhengzhou, a city that symbolizes China's housing glut. Bank officials didn't respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An early sign of trouble came with the 2014 default of a $538 million asset created by Evergrowing Bank Co., a small bank in Shandong province, to channel funds to an investment firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evergrowing included the asset in its investment receivables, setting aside just 25% of risk-weighted capital against possible losses on the investment, according to analysts and the bank. If the asset had been counted as a loan, Evergrowing would have been required to set aside four times as much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first, the maneuver increased the bank's capital and profits. But the default wiped out nearly 60% of the net income Evergrowing had earned in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Disguising loans as investments took off because of the government's efforts to make it easier for banks to compete on interest rates. That has eaten away at profits banks make from the difference between what they charge on loans and pay on deposits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank of Nanjing was started in 1996 and became a major player in China's government-bond market by buying and selling such bonds. People familiar with the bank said the initial focus on trading and investing eventually hindered expansion, since rules limited the growth of its portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Getting around those limits was part of the impetus to increase investment receivables, the people close to Bank of Nanjing said. In 2013, the bank formed an asset-management firm called Xin Yuan Asset Management Co., which became the bank's primary partner in packaging loans as investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the money has flowed to projects like those in Haimen. In 2014, Bank of Nanjing gave $29 million to Haimen Development and Investment Co., the main financing company owned by the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of a traditional loan to the financing company, Bank of Nanjing asked Xin Yuan to create a $29 million investment product with an annual yield of about 8.8%. The bank then pitched the investment to its own retail customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sequence helped the bank get around several different lending restrictions. The city-owned financing company received a big infusion even though it is deeply in debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Haimen Development has more than 60 yuan in debts for every 100 yuan in assets it owns, according to a financial disclosure by the company. Last year, its operations were more than $100 million in the red, meaning it is kept afloat with government support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea behind the apartment complex was to move farmers into the units as part of a broader move to cities across China. But jobs, schools and health-care services have lagged behind. Half the apartments were empty during a recent visit, and an open space with a playground was deserted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An official at Haimen Development said the $29 million "will be fully paid off" and declined to comment further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank of Nanjing said in a written statement that all its operations "meet legal and regulatory requirements." The bank said it follows a "comprehensive risk-management" strategy while expanding its businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other projects funded the same way by the bank include an industrial park across the Yangtze River from the city of Nanjing. That project received $23 million in the form of an investment receivable, according to the people familiar with the matter and documents reviewed by the Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a new road leads to the industrial park and the area is filled with construction cranes, few businesses or factories seem to be moving in. The industrial park is an expansion of an industrial zone pocked with empty lots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The industrial park has been here for many years, but I've never seen much business here," said Wu Haoyuan, a construction worker on a nearby building site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From 2013 to 2015, assets at Bank of Nanjing nearly doubled, including the surge in investment receivables. In the first nine months of this year, profits jumped 23% from a year earlier. Soured loans total less than 1% of assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank has an ample capital cushion, based on its stated loan portfolio. But if all its shadow loans were treated as actual loans, the bank's Tier 1 capital ratio could fall below the 6.7% required by regulators, according to the methodology used by Mr. Bedford, the UBS analyst. Tier 1 measures a bank's highest-quality capital as a percentage of risk-weighted assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, ratings firm <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> downgraded its credit outlook on the bank to negative from stable, citing an eroded capital buffer following rapid expansion. S&amp;P later withdrew its ratings at the bank's request. The ratings firm declined to comment on Bank of Nanjing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lender isn't worried about its funding for the apartment complex in Haimen or the industrial park in Nanjing, according to people close to the bank. The reason: Whether the projects make economic sense or not, bank officials expect to be repaid because of the projects' government ties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All banks are trying to move [loans] off balance sheets," said an official at Bank of Nanjing, nodding to a common belief in China that Beijing always will stand behind the country's banks. "The only risk we have is sovereign risk."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President-elect Donald Trump has made investing in U.S. infrastructure a priority. America urgently needs to build and repair roads, bridges, airports, pipelines and rail lines. But a huge roadblock is the federal permitting system. Even with a more business-friendly administration, a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan won't accomplish much unless Congress reforms the way public-works projects are approved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">America used to be the envy of the world in building great projects responsibly, efficiently and on time. The Pentagon was built in 16 months. The 1,500-mile Alaska-Canadian Highway, which passes through some of the world's most rugged terrain, took about eight months. Today, infrastructure projects across America often require several years simply to get through the federal government's prebuild permitting process. Consider a few examples.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New U.S. highway construction projects usually take between nine and 19 years from initial planning and permitting to completion of construction, according to a 2002 <span class="companylink">Government Accountability Office</span> study. It will have taken 14 years to permit an expansion of Gross Reservoir in Colorado, and it took almost 20 years to permit the Kensington gold mine in Alaska.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It took four years to construct a new runway at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, but it took 15 years to get the permits. Todd Hauptli of the <span class="companylink">American Association of Airport Executives</span> bitterly joked to the Senate Commerce Committee last year, "It took longer to build that runway than the Great Pyramids of Egypt."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These problems have been swelling for decades as the U.S. regulatory state has grown. But the Obama administration has made the situation much worse by politicizing the construction of America's critical energy infrastructure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It took <span class="companylink">Shell</span> seven years and $7 billion to get White House permission to drill a single oil-exploration well off the coast of Alaska. Never mind that the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act requires that resources in those waters "be made available for expeditious and orderly development." This capricious permitting was part of the reason why <span class="companylink">Shell</span> halted its operations in Alaska, stranding enormous oil and gas resources and killing thousands of potential jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Keystone XL pipeline languished in permitting purgatory for almost the entire two terms of the Obama administration before the president finally killed it in 2015. Terry O'Sullivan, president of the <span class="companylink">Laborers' International Union of North America</span>, called the president's actions a "cynical manipulation of the approval process." President Obama also recently halted the Dakota Access pipeline, though in September a federal court determined that the project complied with arduous permitting, legal and consultation requirements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trump is set to reverse the Obama administration's abysmal permitting record, but Congress also has a responsibility. Last year I introduced the Regulations Endanger Democracy Act, or RED Tape Act, which would cap federal regulations with a simple one-in-one-out rule. When an agency issues a new regulation, it must repeal an old one. (Mr. Trump has suggested removing two for every one that is added.) Even though the idea has been successfully implemented in Canada and the United Kingdom, not a single Senate Democrat voted for it, and the legislation died.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another bill I wrote would expedite federal permitting to repair or rebuild thousands of crumbling bridges across the country, but it received only three Democratic votes on the Senate floor. Once again my colleagues across the aisle prevented this reform from being implemented.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Congress convenes in January, I will introduce the Rebuild America Now Act. It would establish strict time limits so that if permits aren't approved or denied for good cause within a specified time, then the project is deemed approved. The law also creates a one-stop shop for environmental reviews and permitting to ensure that projects don't get bogged down by agencies pursuing different agendas. Agencies would be required to abide by the RED Tape Act, a version of which would be part of the new law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having lost the election, progressives are already preparing litigation and protests to stop American infrastructure and energy projects. My bill would limit sue-and-settle practices that abuse the judicial system, as well as stopping groups that oppose economic development from needlessly delaying or killing much-needed projects. It would also have a builder's and worker's bill of rights, which would include timely permitting decisions and transparency in agency decision-making to spell out exactly why a permit is denied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama's $800 billion stimulus in 2009 wrecked the country's balance sheet while doing little to spur economic growth. An infrastructure bill that fails to reform dysfunctional permitting runs a similar risk. These reforms will prevent billions of dollars from getting wasted in red tape and litigation, making it easier to overhaul the nation's infrastructure.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of U.S. home builders have trailed the broader market in recent months amid growing concerns over rising land and labor costs and a housing recovery that has been slower and weaker than expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors will get fresh insight into the sector this week as builders Toll Brothers Inc. and <span class="companylink">Hovnanian Enterprises Inc</span>. report earnings results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two companies are in starkly different positions nearly a decade after the housing bust. <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> has one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry, while Hovnanian has struggled under a massive debt load from land purchases and acquisitions made during the boom years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors also will be looking for signs of the impact that rising mortgage rates might have on home purchases in the wake of Donald Trump's presidential-election victory. Rates have jumped about half a percentage point since the election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National home prices reached a record high in September, according to the latest reading by the S&amp;P <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> Case-Shiller index. But home building remains far below historical levels typically associated with recovering markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a luxury builder, Toll Brothers has faced concerns this year about its exposure to high-end markets that are softening, including in New York City. Last quarter the company cut its guidance on gross profit margin for the year, citing lower margins in its high-end condo division in New York because of delays in delivering units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York City represents less than 10% of the company's revenue, but in recent years it has played a big role in boosting the company's margins. As the housing recovery progresses and more first-time buyers enter the market, some analysts are concerned there may be less overall demand for higher-end product than in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We think most of the growth is at the lower end of the market. That's where the pent-up demand is," said Peter Martin, an analyst at JMP Securities who follows the home-building industry. "If you're a wealthy individual, you really don't have a ton of incentive now to switch your housing choice. You probably got a great price during the downturn, so why would you want to buy another house and raise your taxes?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the lower guidance on margins and worries about a slowdown in New York, <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> has seen significant growth in other profitable markets such as California. The company has authorized $400 million in share repurchases over the past year in an effort to boost returns. Company executives recently announced plans to introduce a slightly less expensive line of homes in the $400,000 to $500,000 range geared toward affluent first-time millennial buyers who have waited to make their first purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chief Executive Douglas Yearley said at an investor conference last month the goal is to target younger buyers who "can afford a little more and can aspire for their first home to be a 3 series <span class="companylink">BMW</span>."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Hovnanian Enterprises</span> has been challenged throughout the recovery by its debt, and it stock price has mostly hovered below $2 a share since mid-2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of Hovnanian's low credit rating, it has been difficult to refinance, meaning the company has had to dip into cash to pay off $320 million in debt over the past year. Without access to capital, growth prospects are difficult.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hovnanian has started pulling back from Minnesota, North Carolina, Tampa, Fla., and the Bay Area in the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Northern California, company executives said they are turning more attention to the Sacramento market, while in Florida they are focusing on Orlando and the southeastern Florida areas such as Palm Beach and Broward counties. It sold out of Minnesota and North Carolina entirely.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sean Dobson wanted to start a mortgage bank four years ago to serve borrowers with middling credit or irregular income. He eventually decided that growing regulatory hurdles and other costs would erase his returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, he purchased thousands of homes in states from Texas to Indiana and now rents them to people who might have been his borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. consumers and businesses have enjoyed ultralow borrowing costs since the financial crisis because the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> pinned interest rates near zero. At the same time, regulators and lenders intent on fortifying the financial system have clamped down on risk-taking, making it harder for many borrowers to get loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result is that lending for housing, a pillar of the U.S. economy, has bifurcated. Well-off households and home builders have their choice of loans, while many others without solid credit or stable incomes are locked out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That dynamic is one reason the U.S. has seen such anemic economic growth despite aggressive efforts to encourage investment. Money has been cheaper and more abundant than ever, but -- for some -- much harder to get.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Policy makers have focused on "lowering the cost of capital instead of increasing the availability of credit," says Mr. Dobson, chief executive of Amherst Holdings, an investment firm in Austin, Texas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private investment across the economy is now about 6% above its prerecession level on a per-capita basis, but that obscures large differences. Spending on consumer durables, which include cars, appliances and smartphones, is 21% above prerecession levels. Residential real-estate investment, however, is 22% below its prerecession level, according to the Federal Reserve of St. Louis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices and sales have risen since 2011, with prices nationally surpassing their 2006 highs, before adjusting for inflation. But new construction collapsed so drastically during the bust that even today it has returned only to levels normally seen in recessions. Sales of new homes are running about 30% below the average between 1983 and 2007 and are lower than every one of those years except for the recession of 1990-91.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are at a point when housing should be going gangbusters. It's not going anywhere," says Lewis Ranieri, a financier who pioneered the market for mortgage-backed securities in the 1980s. "The people with access to credit have become rich, and the people without access don't even have a chance to climb up the ladder."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes are generally the biggest purchase Americans make, and housing dollars ripple through the economy by triggering spending on appliances, furniture and landscaping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family home construction accounted for 2% of gross domestic product, on average, during the 1990s. It has averaged just 1% of GDP since the recession ended in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lending for home purchases hit its highest level since 2007 during the April-to-June quarter, but almost all the growth has come from borrowers with credit scores of at least 700. Credit scores run between 300 and 850, with scores below 620 considered subprime. Borrowers with scores below 700 accounted for just 15% of originations, the lowest share of such lending since at least 2000, according to data provider <span class="companylink">Black Knight Financial Services</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regulators have defended the spate of rules implemented after the crisis while acknowledging the strain. "No economic sector that precipitates a global financial meltdown could possibly expect to escape far-reaching reforms," said Richard Cordray, director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, in a speech to mortgage bankers in October. Nevertheless, he added, "the market is not yet supporting access to credit for the full spectrum of creditworthy borrowers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts at <span class="companylink">Pacific Investment Management Co</span>. estimate between one million and 1.4 million Americans who would have been eligible for a mortgage in 2002, before the loosening of lending standards that caused the subprime crisis, couldn't get a mortgage today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bifurcation has made the banking system and the economy less susceptible to the kind of losses that triggered the 2008 financial crisis, but also shows how policy makers retreated from a bipartisan push of homeownership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The homeownership rate has fallen on a year-over-year basis in every quarter for the last 10 years, and a surge in renting has dropped the homeownership rate to a 50-year low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks would rather extend more credit to large, established firms than make lots of smaller loans to mom-and-pop builders, many of which lost money during the downturn, says Charles Schetter, chief executive of Smith Douglas Homes Inc., a large, privately held builder in Atlanta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For the first time, the burden of regulation is setting up a threshold of scale," says Mr. Schetter, whose company will sell 700 homes this year. He started out in the industry building homes with his father, "when anyone with a hammer, a pickup truck and access to local tradesmen" could start a company, which he says would be difficult today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consolidation in the home building and banking industries predated the financial crisis but accelerated during the downturn. Banks with more than $100 billion in assets held around two-thirds of construction loans in 2016, up from less than half during the housing bubble and less than one-third in 2000, according to the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suppliers and vendors throughout the housing ecosystem were left reeling from the crash, and builders say their challenges finding plumbers, electricians and house framers has begun to limit their ability to build homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim Ellenburg started his own flooring supply and installation company in 2009 after he was laid off from a firm that closed when builders couldn't pay their bills. He couldn't get a loan to start the company, so he used his credit cards. Now that his company has a solid record -- he expects $90 million in sales this year in three states -- banks are eager to lend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That's part of the problem: You can't get credit until you can demonstrate you don't need it," says Mr. Ellenburg, owner of Cartersville Flooring Center in Cartersville, Ga.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With home prices nationally now above their highs of last decade, investors who took huge risks buying tens of thousands of homes as the market hit bottom are reaping the benefits. Some of their renters are former owners who couldn't pay their mortgages after the bust and weren't able to buy again when homes became much cheaper because they couldn't meet lenders' tightened requirements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dobson's rental-home firm, Main Street Renewal, rents 11,000 homes in 18 states, primarily in the South and Midwest. "Unless something changes dramatically in Washington, this is the way a lot of people are going to be in their first home," says Mr. Dobson, who is still tinkering with ways to start a mortgage bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By some measures, mortgage standards aren't any tighter today than they were in the early 1990s. But demographic changes, including more households delaying marriage and a higher share of younger households with less inherited wealth, suggest that, when combined with more-stringent credit rules,a homeownership rate below the historical level of 64% "is absolutely here to stay," says Laurie Goodman of the Urban Institute think tank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've sat through four years of home-buyer classes where people know they are missing out on the deal of a lifetime and can't get the credit to compete for it," says Glenn Kelman, chief executive of Redfin, a real-estate brokerage that operates in 37 states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Policy makers have struggled for decades to find the right lending balance. Beginning in the 1970s, regulators tried to end a discriminatory practice known as "redlining," in which banks avoided predominantly African-American neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the late 1990s, Wall Street rushed into the subprime-mortgage business, long dominated by local niche lenders, transforming pools of those loans into highly rated securities. When the Fed started raising rates in 2004, lenders lowered standards to keep loan volumes from falling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"No one thought about affordability or sustainability," says Ms. Wooten, the Chicago housing counselor. "The only thing they thought was, 'Everybody can be a homeowner.' That was crazy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When property values fell in 2007, the riskiest loans defaulted, credit tightened and the economy ultimately fell into a recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress responded in 2010 by passing the Dodd-Frank Act, which created the new <span class="companylink">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</span>, and asked it and other regulators to flesh out several new sets of rules, including requiring lenders to ensure borrowers have the ability to repay loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government took control of mortgage giants <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, which together with agencies such as the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span> guaranteed most new mortgages. Fannie and Freddie increased fees for riskier borrowers, widening the gap between mortgage rates available to borrowers with good and weak credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By late 2011, the Obama administration had grown worried about the cumulative effect of the new rules and ultimately prevailed on regulators to back off some of the most stringent proposals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There was a lot of concern that steps intended to protect the market would end up locking people out," says James Parrott, a former White House official involved in those efforts who is now a mortgage-industry consultant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders have been reluctant to extend credit to the limits of what government programs allow because of concerns over lawsuits if loans ultimately default, and because the costs of managingdelinquent mortgages have soared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If we had our druthers, we would never service a defaulted mortgage again," said J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. Chief Executive James Dimon in a shareholder letter earlier this year. "We do not want be in the business of foreclosure because it is exceedingly painful for our customers. . .and our reputation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> cut its mortgage offerings to 15, from 37, and said it had"dramatically reduced" its participation in low-down-payment lending through the <span class="companylink">FHA</span>. "It is simply too costly and too risky to originate these kinds of mortgages," said Mr. Dimon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Giving the Basics</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of Getting a Loan</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent Saturday afternoon, Margaret Wooten of the <span class="companylink">Chicago Urban League</span> counseled renters at a homebuying fair on the basics of getting a loan in today's more stringent environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a packed bus touring foreclosed properties about to hit the market on Chicago's South Side, Ms. Wooten explained how banks' insistence on using tax returns to verify incomes -- put in place to satisfy the new ability-to-repay regulations -- had created bigger hurdles for small-business owners and the self-employed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They sometimes legally write off business expenses to lower their taxable income but then can have trouble proving their higher take-home pay to lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"No, you didn't have to pay Uncle Sam, but you're not going to get that home, either," she told attendees. Ms. Wooten cautioned against going out to buy furniture or a new car after getting approved to buy a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Do not touch anything after you've been approved," she said. "Leave your credit as it is."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Sweden, the average mortgage held by a bank needs much less bank equity than in the U.S. -- but how much less is jaw-dropping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a U.S. bank, $100,000 of average mortgage debt requires $7,040 of bank equity to guard against losses, assuming a common-equity capital ratio of 11%. Using the same ratio in Sweden, the equity required is just $770.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That huge difference has many explanations -- and these two markets are extremes. But it highlights why mortgages are such a big part of the battle to complete global capital rules in the <span class="companylink">Basel Committee</span>, the global conclave of regulators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgages make up about half of all bank loans globally, so this is no small fight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The battle comes down to how banks judge the riskiness of their mortgages. The global standard is that big banks use their own models to make that judgment, which is expressed through risk-weightings. This creates the measure of bank balance sheets that determines their equity requirements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regulators worry that risk judgments -- and capital -- are too varied. Sweden has among the lowest average risk-weightings for mortgages in the world at 7%, according to <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>. Much of the rest of Europe plus Australia and Hong Kong are in the 10% to 20% range. In the U.S., the average is 64%. Some regulators have been pushing for a minimum of about 25%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks argue that mortgages in different markets have different risks. In the U.S., banks keep only their riskier loans; the safest, prime mortgages get sold to <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. Borrowers in many U.S. states can walk away from mortgages, leaving banks to sell the house. In Sweden, the U.K. and Australia, mortgages are full-recourse, so borrowers can be pursued for all that they owe even after a house has been seized and sold. Also, in Sweden, any kind of default can block people from getting credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some markets also have smaller average loan sizes compared with home values -- although that can hide aggressive recent lending when older loans have been mostly repaid or house prices have risen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such things truly help explain why historic defaults and losses are much lower in some markets. The problem is that risk-weights based on the past can't capture all future risks. Products and behavior change, while lending and price moves feed off each other to overheat housing markets and destabilize them. That is why Sweden and Australia want Basel to create minimum risk-weights. Others are fighting this, in part because of how it could hurt other loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without agreement, countries will increasingly act alone. Sweden has forced its banks to lift common-equity capital ratios to more than 19% on average. That increases the equity Swedish banks hold against the average $100,000 of mortgages to $1,344 rather than $770, but it is still among the lowest in the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are real market differences, but more countries need a firmer floor on mortgage risks.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of U.S. home builders have trailed the broader market in recent months amid growing concerns over rising land and labor costs and a housing recovery that has been slower and weaker than expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors will get fresh insight into the sector this week as builders Toll Brothers Inc. and <span class="companylink">Hovnanian Enterprises Inc</span>. report earnings results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two companies are in starkly different positions nearly a decade after the housing bust. <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> has one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry, while Hovnanian has struggled under a massive debt load from land purchases and acquisitions made during the boom years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors also will be looking for signs of the impact that rising mortgage rates might have on home purchases in the wake of Donald Trump's presidential-election victory. Rates have jumped about half a percentage point since the election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National home prices reached a record high in September, according to the latest reading by the S&amp;P <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> Case-Shiller index. But home building remains far below historical levels typically associated with recovering markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a luxury builder, Toll Brothers has faced concerns this year about its exposure to high-end markets that are softening, including in New York City. Last quarter the company cut its guidance on gross profit margin for the year, citing lower margins in its high-end condo division in New York because of delays in delivering units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York City represents less than 10% of the company's revenue, but in recent years it has played a big role in boosting the company's margins. As the housing recovery progresses and more first-time buyers enter the market, some analysts are concerned there may be less overall demand for higher-end product than in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We think most of the growth is at the lower end of the market. That's where the pent-up demand is," said Peter Martin, an analyst at JMP Securities who follows the home-building industry. "If you're a wealthy individual, you really don't have a ton of incentive now to switch your housing choice. You probably got a great price during the downturn, so why would you want to buy another house and raise your taxes?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the lower guidance on margins and worries about a slowdown in New York, <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> has seen significant growth in other profitable markets such as California. The company has authorized $400 million in share repurchases over the past year in an effort to boost returns. Company executives recently announced plans to introduce a slightly less expensive line of homes in the $400,000 to $500,000 range geared toward affluent first-time millennial buyers who have waited to make their first purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Hovnanian Enterprises</span> has been challenged throughout the recovery by its debt, and it stock price has mostly hovered below $2 a share since mid-2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of Hovnanian's low credit rating, it has been difficult to refinance, meaning the company has had to dip into cash to pay off $320 million in debt over the past year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The homeownership rate has fallen on a year-over-year basis in every quarter for the last 10 years, and a surge in renting has dropped the homeownership rate[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/new-housing-crisis-looms-as-fewer-renters-can-afford-to-own-1433698639] to a 50-year low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks would rather extend more credit to large, established firms than make lots of smaller loans to mom-and-pop builders, many of which lost money during the downturn, says Charles Schetter, chief executive of Smith Douglas Homes Inc., a large, privately held builder in Atlanta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For the first time, the burden of regulation is setting up a threshold of scale," says Mr. Schetter, whose company will sell 700 homes this year. He started out in the industry building homes with his father, "when anyone with a hammer, a pickup truck and access to local tradesmen" could start a company, which he says would be difficult today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consolidation in the home building and banking industries predated the financial crisis but accelerated during the downturn. Banks with more than $100 billion in assets held around two-thirds of construction loans in 2016, up from less than half during the housing bubble and less than one-third in 2000, according to the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suppliers and vendors throughout the housing ecosystem were left reeling from the crash, and builders say their challenges finding plumbers, electricians and house framers has begun to limit their ability to build homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim Ellenburg started his own flooring supply and installation company in 2009 after he was laid off from a firm that closed when builders couldn't pay their bills. He couldn't get a loan to start the company, so he used his credit cards. Now that his company has a solid record—he expects $90 million in sales this year in three states—banks are eager to lend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That's part of the problem: You can't get credit until you can demonstrate you don't need it," says Mr. Ellenburg, owner of Cartersville Flooring Center in Cartersville, Ga.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With home prices nationally now above their highs of last decade, investors who took huge risks buying tens of thousands of homes as the market hit bottom[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/SB10001424127887324034804578346800317118568] are reaping the benefits. Some of their renters are former owners who couldn't pay their mortgages after the bust and weren't able to buy again when homes became much cheaper because they couldn't meet lenders' tightened requirements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dobson's rental-home firm, Main Street Renewal, rents 11,000 homes in 18 states, primarily in the South and Midwest. "Unless something changes dramatically in Washington, this is the way a lot of people are going to be in their first home," says Mr. Dobson, who is still tinkering with ways to start a mortgage bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent Saturday afternoon, Margaret Wooten of the <span class="companylink">Chicago Urban League</span> counseled renters at a homebuying fair on the basics of getting a loan in today's more stringent environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a packed bus touring foreclosed properties about to hit the market on Chicago's South Side, Ms. Wooten explained how banks' insistence on using tax returns to verify incomes—put in place to satisfy the new ability-to-repay regulations—had created bigger hurdles for small-business owners and the self-employed. They sometimes legally write off business expenses to lower their taxable income but then can have trouble proving their higher take-home pay to lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"No, you didn't have to pay Uncle Sam, but you're not going to get that home, either," she told attendees. Ms. Wooten cautioned against going out to buy furniture or a new car after getting approved to buy a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Do not touch anything after you've been approved," she said. "Leave your credit as it is."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By some measures, mortgage standards aren't any tighter today than they were in the early 1990s. But demographic changes, including more households delaying marriage and a higher share of younger households with less inherited wealth, suggest that, when combined with more-stringent credit rules, a homeownership rate below the historical level of 64% "is absolutely here to stay," says Laurie Goodman of the Urban Institute think tank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've sat through four years of home-buyer classes where people know they are missing out on the deal of a lifetime and can't get the credit to compete for it," says Glenn Kelman, chief executive of Redfin, a real-estate brokerage that operates in 37 states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Policy makers have struggled for decades to find the right lending balance. Beginning in the 1970s, regulators tried to end a discriminatory practice known as "redlining," in which banks avoided predominantly African-American neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the late 1990s, Wall Street rushed into the subprime-mortgage business, long dominated by local niche lenders, transforming pools of those loans into highly rated securities. When the Fed started raising rates in 2004, lenders lowered standards to keep loan volumes from falling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"No one thought about affordability or sustainability," says Ms. Wooten, the Chicago housing counselor. "The only thing they thought was, ‘Everybody can be a homeowner.' That was crazy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When property values fell in 2007, the riskiest loans defaulted, credit tightened and the economy ultimately fell into a recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress responded in 2010 by passing the Dodd-Frank Act, which created the new <span class="companylink">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</span>, and asked it and other regulators to flesh out several new sets of rules, including requiring lenders to ensure borrowers have the ability to repay loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government took control of mortgage giants <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, which together with agencies such as the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span> guaranteed most new mortgages. Fannie and Freddie increased fees for riskier borrowers, widening the gap between mortgage rates available to borrowers with good and weak credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By late 2011, the Obama administration had grown worried about the cumulative effect of the new rules and ultimately prevailed on regulators to back off some of the most stringent proposals[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/SB10001424052702303851804579559673037406670].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There was a lot of concern that steps intended to protect the market would end up locking people out," says James Parrott, a former White House official involved in those efforts who is now a mortgage-industry consultant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders have been reluctant to extend credit[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/SB10000872396390443890304578006482230678780] to the limits of what government programs allow because of concerns over lawsuits if loans ultimately default, and because the costs of managing delinquent mortgages have soared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If we had our druthers, we would never service a defaulted mortgage again," said J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. Chief Executive James Dimon in a shareholder letter earlier this year. "We do not want be in the business of foreclosure because it is exceedingly painful for our customers…and our reputation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> cut its mortgage offerings to 15, from 37, and said it had "dramatically reduced" its participation in low-down-payment lending through the <span class="companylink">FHA</span>. "It is simply too costly and too risky to originate these kinds of mortgages," said Mr. Dimon.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Dan Sullivan </div><div>847 words</div><div>4 December 2016</div><div>16:17</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President-elect Donald Trump has made investing in U.S. infrastructure a priority. This country urgently needs to build and repair roads, bridges, airports, pipelines and rail lines. But a huge roadblock is the federal permitting system. Even with a more business-friendly administration, a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan won't accomplish much unless Congress reforms the way public-works projects are approved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">America used to be the envy of the world in building great projects responsibly, efficiently and on time. The Pentagon was built in 16 months. The 1,500-mile Alaska-Canadian Highway, which passes through some of the world's most rugged terrain, took about eight months. Today, infrastructure projects across America often require several years simply to get through the federal government's pre-build permitting process. Consider a few examples.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New U.S. highway construction projects usually take between nine and 19 years from initial planning and permitting to completion of construction, according to a 2002 <span class="companylink">Government Accountability Office</span> study[http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-02-1067T]. It will have taken 14 years to permit an expansion of Gross Reservoir in Colorado, and it took almost 20 years to permit the Kensington gold mine in Alaska.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It took four years to construct a new runway at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, but it took 15 years to get the permits. Todd Hauptli of the <span class="companylink">American Association of Airport Executives</span> bitterly joked to the Senate Commerce Committee last year, "It took longer to build that runway than the Great Pyramids of Egypt."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These problems have been building for decades as the U.S. regulatory state has grown. But the Obama administration has made the situation much worse by politicizing the construction of America's critical energy infrastructure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It took <span class="companylink">Shell</span> seven years and $7 billion to get White House permission to drill a single oil-exploration well off the coast of Alaska. Never mind that the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act requires that resources in those waters "be made available for expeditious and orderly development." This capricious permitting was part of why <span class="companylink">Shell</span> halted its operations in Alaska, stranding enormous oil and gas resources and killing thousands of potential jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Keystone XL pipeline languished in permitting purgatory for almost the entire two terms of the Obama administration before the president finally killed it in 2015. Terry O'Sullivan, president of the <span class="companylink">Laborers' International Union of North America</span>, called the president's actions a "cynical manipulation of the approval process." President Obama also recently halted the Dakota Access pipeline, though in September a federal court[http://earthjustice.org/sites/default/files/files/order-denying-PI.pdf] determined that the project complied with arduous permitting, legal and consultation requirements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trump is set to reverse the Obama administration's abysmal permitting record, but Congress also has a responsibility. Last year I introduced the Regulations Endanger Democracy Act, or RED Tape Act[https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/1944/all-info], which would cap federal regulations with a simple one-in-one-out rule. When an agency issues a new regulation, it must repeal an old one. (Mr. Trump has suggested removing two for every one that is added.) Even though the idea has been successfully implemented in Canada and the United Kingdom, not a single Senate Democrat voted for it, and the legislation died.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another bill I wrote would expedite federal permitting to repair or rebuild thousands of crumbling bridges across our country, but it received only three Democratic votes on the Senate floor. Once again my colleagues across the aisle prevented this reform from being implemented.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Congress convenes in January, I will introduce the Rebuild America Now Act. It would establish strict time limits so that if permits aren't approved or denied for good cause within a specified time, then the project is deemed approved. The law also creates a one-stop shop for environmental reviews and permitting to ensure that projects don't get bogged down by agencies pursuing different agendas. Agencies would be required to abide by the RED Tape Act, a version of which would be part of the new law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having lost the election, progressives are already preparing litigation and protests to stop American infrastructure and energy projects. My bill would limit sue-and-settle practices that abuse the judicial system, as well as stopping groups that oppose economic development from needlessly delaying or killing much-needed projects. It would also have a builder's and worker's bill of rights, which would include timely permitting decisions and transparency in agency decision-making to spell out exactly why a permit is denied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama's $800 billion stimulus in 2009 wrecked the country's balance sheet while doing little to spur economic growth. An infrastructure bill that fails to reform dysfunctional permitting runs a similar risk. These reforms will prevent billions of dollars from getting wasted in red tape and litigation, making it easier to overhaul the nation's infrastructure.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Chris Kirkham </div><div>739 words</div><div>4 December 2016</div><div>15:10</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of U.S. home builders have trailed the broader market in recent months amid growing concerns over rising land and labor costs and a housing recovery that has been slower and weaker than expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors will get fresh insight into the sector next week as builders Toll Brothers Inc. and <span class="companylink">Hovnanian Enterprises Inc</span>. report earnings results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two companies are in starkly different positions nearly a decade after the housing bust. <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> has one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry, while Hovnanian has struggled under a massive debt load from land purchases and acquisitions made during the boom years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors also will be looking for signs of the impact that rising mortgage rates might have on home purchases in the wake of Donald Trump's presidential election victory. Rates have jumped about half a percentage point since the election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National home prices reached a record high in September, according to the latest reading by the S&amp;P <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> Case-Shiller index. But home building remains far below historical levels typically associated with recovering markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a luxury builder, Toll Brothers has faced concerns this year about its exposure to high-end markets that are softening, including in New York City. Last quarter the company cut its guidance on gross profit margin for the year, citing lower margins in its high-end condo division in New York due to delays in delivering units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York City represents less than 10% of the company's revenue, but in recent years it has played a big role in boosting the company's margins. As the housing recovery progresses and more first-time buyers enter the market, some analysts are concerned there may be less overall demand for higher-end product than in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We think most of the growth is at the lower end of the market. That's where the pent-up demand is," said Peter Martin, an analyst at JMP Securities who follows the home-building industry. "If you're a wealthy individual, you really don't have a ton of incentive now to switch your housing choice. You probably got a great price during the downturn, so why would you want to buy another house and raise your taxes?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the lower guidance on margins and worries about a slowdown in New York, <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> has seen significant growth in other profitable markets such as California. The company has authorized $400 million in share repurchases over the past year in an effort to boost returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Company executives recently announced plans to introduce a slightly less expensive line of homes in the $400,000 to $500,000 range geared toward affluent first-time millennial buyers who have waited to make their first purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chief Executive Douglas Yearley said at an investor conference last month the goal is to target younger buyers who "can afford a little more and can aspire for their first home to be a 3 series <span class="companylink">BMW</span>."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Hovnanian Enterprises</span> has been challenged throughout the recovery by its debt, and it stock price has mostly hovered below $2 a share since mid-2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of Hovnanian's low credit rating, it has been difficult to refinance, meaning the company has had to dip in to cash to pay off $320 million in debt over the past year. Without access to capital, growth prospects are difficult.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hovnanian has started pulling back from Minnesota, North Carolina, Tampa, Fla., and the Bay Area in the past year. In Northern California, company executives said they are turning more attention to the Sacramento market while in Florida they are focusing on Orlando and the southeastern Florida areas such as Palm Beach and Broward counties. It sold out of Minnesota and North Carolina entirely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If we kept all of our markets open, then we would have less to invest in all of our markets," Larry Sorsby, the company's chief financial officer, said at a conference in September. "So we said ‘Let's rationalize our footprint'."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kim Mackrael </div><div>1030 words</div><div>3 December 2016</div><div>07:00</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Canadian province of British Columbia imposed a 15% tax on foreign home buyers in Vancouver this summer[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/vancouver-unveils-new-tax-for-foreign-home-buyers-1469478909], Frank Daams and Sabine Bosklopper faced an unenviable choice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The American couple could walk away from a deposit worth the equivalent of roughly $38,000 on the Vancouver home they were planning to buy and risk being sued by the seller, or they could dip into their retirement savings for the nearly $113,000 they would need to cover the tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At the end we decided we can make that happen," Mr. Daams said of their decision to use their retirement savings. "We picked from the better of two evils."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple, in Canada because of a company transfer, unexpectedly found themselves caught up in a global crackdown on foreign home buyers. A surge in prices has driven the cost of a typical home up by 25% in Vancouver and 20% in Toronto over the past year alone, through October. Canada's national housing agency issued its strongest warning yet[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/canada-housing-agency-raises-warning-level-on-conditions-1477501088] in October on the state of the housing markets, saying rapid price growth in Toronto and Vancouver has now spread to other cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Policy makers in Canada—along with their counterparts in Australia and the U.K.—attribute some of the price surge to an influx of buyers from countries such as China who are helping to drive up demand for housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Canadian government</span> has tightened mortgage rules multiple times since 2008. In October, it said it would close a capital-gains tax loophole for foreign buyers and would expand a "stress test" to ensure new homeowners with mortgage insurance can afford higher interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The regional government in British Columbia has put a tax on any buyer in metro Vancouver who isn't a permanent resident or a citizen of Canada. Similar policies were introduced several years ago in Hong Kong and Singapore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The British Columbia government has said it introduced the tax in response to affordability concerns in Vancouver. The tax is meant to help manage housing demand, and revenue from the tax is earmarked for affordable rental and housing programs in the region, the government said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is difficult to know how effective such taxes have been in cooling home prices in Canada and abroad, in part because they were introduced amid a raft of other housing measures. Home prices in Hong Kong began to cool last year but increased again this past summer, prompting policy makers last month to raise taxes for most residential transactions[http://blogs.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/moneybeat/2016/11/06/hong-kong-property-tax-just-redirects-easy-money/].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales in Vancouver fell nearly 39% in October from a year earlier, extending a run of declines in recent months, yet prices continue to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only government study that specifically addresses foreign buyers by citizenship found that 234 Chinese buyers completed home purchases in metro Vancouver from June 10 to June 29, accounting for most of the purchases by foreigners and about 5% of sales overall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Daams, whose U.S.-based construction firm transferred him to Vancouver a little over a year ago to head its Canadian operations, argues that as the holder of a three-year permit to work in Canada, he shouldn't fall under a tax provision aimed at curbing foreign investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Is it fair to charge a guy like me, that actually has a work visa under [the <span class="companylink">North American Free Trade Agreement</span>] and is here to just go work, versus people who are investing heavily in Vancouver and driving this market crazy?" Mr. Daams asked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Things turned out better for Irish citizen Kirsty Engleke. She and her American husband, who both work in the film industry, signed a contract earlier this year to buy a condominium in Vancouver's Mount Pleasant neighborhood for the equivalent of more than $450,000. The deal was supposed to close in September, but a request from the seller to move the date meant the sale went through just three days before the foreign-buyer tax came into effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We got really lucky," Ms. Engleke said. She said the couple would otherwise have been forced to walk away from their deposit because the nearly $68,000 in tax was more than they could afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada was home to roughly 40,000 Americans on work permits at the end of 2015, according to the most recently available <span class="companylink">Canadian government</span> statistics. An additional 280,000 people from other countries had Canadian work permits at the end of that year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toronto lawyer Barry Appleton said he thinks Americans and Mexicans have a strong case to fight the tax under the <span class="companylink">North American Free Trade Agreement</span>, which requires governments to treat investors from member countries as favorably as domestic investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lawsuit filed by Vancouver lawyer Luciana Brasil in September alleges the provincial government acted outside its jurisdiction and infringed on federal government powers when it targeted home buyers' nationality. The lawsuit is under consideration by British Columbia's Supreme Court, which will decide whether it can proceed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Daams and his wife signed a contract on their home July 20, just days before British Columbia announced the 15% foreign buyer tax. They canceled a planned vacation in an effort to close the deal before the policy came into effect, but delays on the seller's side made that impossible, Mr. Daams said. At one point, the couple joked about putting the house in the name of their then 6-month-old son, who was born in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agents and buyers have expressed frustration that buyers were given only a week's notice before the tax came into effect and that it was applied to deals that were already in progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm not against the law," Mr. Daams said. "I mean, they can do what they want in the end. I'm just really against the way they implemented it."</p>

</span>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Sweden, the average mortgage held by a bank needs much less bank equity than in the U.S.--but how much less is jaw-dropping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a U.S. bank, $100,000 of average mortgage debt requires $7,040 of bank equity to guard against losses assuming a common equity capital ratio of 11%. Using the same ratio in Sweden, the equity required is just $770.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That huge difference has many explanations—and these two markets are extremes. But it highlights why mortgages are such a big part of the battle to finalize global capital rules in the <span class="companylink">Basel Committee</span>, the global conclave of regulators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgages make up about half of all bank loans globally, so this is no small fight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The battle comes down to how banks judge the riskiness of their mortgages. The current global standard is that big banks use their own models to make that judgment, which is expressed through risk-weightings. This creates the measure of bank balance sheets that determines their equity requirements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regulators worry that risk judgments—and capital—are too varied[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/why-global-rule-makers-see-risks-in-european-banks-1474283129]. Sweden has among the lowest average risk weightings for mortgages in the world at 7%, according to <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>. Much of the rest of Europe plus Australia and Hong Kong are in the 10% to 20% range. In the U.S., the average is 64%. Some regulators have been pushing for a minimum of about 25%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Banks argue[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/europe-needs-its-own-banking-regulations-deutsche-bank-ceo-says-1479479639] that mortgages in different markets have different risks. In the U.S., banks only keep riskier loans; the safest, prime mortgages get sold to <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. Borrowers in many U.S. states can walk away from mortgages, leaving banks to sell the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Sweden, the U.K. and Australia, mortgages are full-recourse, so borrowers can be pursued for all that they owe even after a house has been seized and sold. Also in Sweden any kind of default can block people from getting new credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some markets also have smaller average loan sizes compared with home values—although that can hide aggressive recent lending when older loans have been mostly repaid or house prices have risen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such things truly help explain why historic defaults and losses are much lower in some markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is that risk-weights based on past experience can't capture all future risks. Products and behavior change, while lending and price moves feed off each other to overheat housing markets and destabilize them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is why Sweden and Australia want Basel to create minimum risk-weights. Others are fighting this in part because of how it could hurt other loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without agreement, countries will increasingly act alone[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/why-investors-should-build-their-own-global-banks-1480078411]. Sweden has forced its banks to lift common equity capital ratios to more than 19% on average. That increases the equity Swedish banks hold against the average $100,000 of mortgages to $1,344 rather than $770, but it is still among the least in the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are real market differences, but more countries need a firmer floor on mortgage risks.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction spending in New York City's health-care sector is surging as hospitals update aging facilities and add preventive health services, a new report finds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hospitals in the city spent more than $6 billion on construction from 2013 through 2015 and are expected to spend $8.2 billion from 2016 through 2018, according to a survey and analysis from the <span class="companylink">New York Building Congress</span>, an industry group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NewYork-Presbyterian and <span class="companylink">NYU Langone Medical Center</span> each spent $500 million to $600 million on construction over 2014 and 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hospitals and health-care facilities are among the most expensive buildings to construct, with costs as high as $1,700 a square foot for highly specialized facilities, according to the report, which got responses from 13 institutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sector's construction spending will add about 2 million square feet of hospital space from 2016 through 2020, according to the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the factors driving the health-care construction boom is the consolidation under way in the industry. Big hospital systems are acquiring other organizations—from doctors' offices to smaller health-care facilities—and are investing in them, said Richard T. Anderson, president of the New York Building Congress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Expanding primary and outpatient-care services both on and off main hospital campuses also has spurred construction with smaller facilities under development throughout the five boroughs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of hospitals in New York have been around for decades, and they really receive a lot of wear and tear, and we have to work to keep them fresh," said Joseph A.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NYU Langone is in the midst of a revitalization at its main campus in Manhattan that includes a new research building and a new 830,000-square-foot hospital building with single-occupancy rooms to improve infection control and the patient experience, said Vicki Match Suna, senior vice president and vice dean for real-estate development and facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NewYork-Presbyterian is finishing the interiors of a new 750,000-square-foot Upper East Side building that will include a women and children's hospital and an ambulatory-care center.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Stefanos Chen   </div><div>431 words</div><div>2 December 2016</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M14</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forget San Francisco. The next stop for jet-setting Chinese home buyers could be Walla Walla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Washington city, about 4 1/2 hours outside of Seattle, is among a number of lesser-known U.S. real-estate markets getting attention from Chinese internet users, according to an analysis of online search traffic to <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty Affiliates</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most popular U.S. markets, by volume of Chinese web traffic to the site, were Southampton, N.Y.; Houston; Brooklyn, N.Y.; Lake Whitingham, Vt., and Monterey, Fla. The company tracked traffic from Chinese IP addresses to the site for 12 months through October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're starting to see that the Chinese are looking in college towns -- this is a newer phenomenon," said John Passerini, Sotheby's global vice president of interactive marketing, adding that Chinese web visitors represent the largest group outside of the U.S., over 1 million unique visitors, or roughly 10% of total traffic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in traffic to smaller markets, like College Place, Wash., a city in Walla Walla County and home to a local university, suggests that Chinese buyers are looking for alternatives to more competitive luxury markets. The most popular search criteria used by Chinese browsers were "waterfront," "gated community" and "green home."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the fourth straight year, the Chinese outspent all other foreign buyers of U.S. real estate combined, with a sales volume of $27.3 billion -- more than three times the amount spent by the next biggest group of foreign buyers, Canadians, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. The Chinese also buy more expensive homes -- a median price of $542,084, compared with the U.S. median of $223,058 for existing home sales. (<span class="companylink">News Corp</span>, which owns The Wall Street Journal, also owns Realtor.com, the listing website of the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Danville, Calif., in the San Francisco Bay Area, Andrew Greenwell of Venture Sotheby's is selling a $4.788 million equestrian estate with a 6,000-square-foot home. With 1,396 page views from China in the past year, it is one of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> most popular listings with Chinese browsers. "They like newer construction and great schools," said Mr. Greenwell, who notes that some Chinese clients have bought homes specifically to enroll their children in top-rated private schools.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Miami Beach Penthouse Asks $65 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawyer-turned-entrepreneur William Duker is putting his Miami Beach penthouse on the market for $65 million. If it fetches its asking price, the property will set a record for a residential sale in the Miami area, according to listing agent Carlo Gambino of <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The penthouse spans the 22nd, 23rd and 24th floors of the Apogee, a waterfront condo tower at the southern tip of Miami Beach. The apartment has more outdoor space than interior space, Mr. Gambino said. Much of the 24th floor is a roof deck containing an outdoor swimming pool and hot tub, as well as an outdoor kitchen and a movie screen. There are wraparound terraces on all three floors, for a total of roughly 13,150 square feet of outdoor space. With views of the ocean, Biscayne Bay and the Miami skyline, the five-bedroom apartment's interior is about 8,300 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Duker bought the penthouse in 2008 for $16.5 million, according to public records. He said he spent about three years renovating it. He built a spiral glass staircase in the double-height living room to create the effect of "walking on air," he said. The apartment also has a private interior elevator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Duker said he usually spends about two months a year at the penthouse; he also has homes in New York City, in upstate New York and in Rome. He said he is selling because he's planning to travel around the world in his new 230-foot yacht, Sybaris.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Duker owns the software company Rational Enterprise. He was one of the founders of <span class="companylink">Amici LLC</span>, a provider of document-discovery services, which was acquired by <span class="companylink">Xerox</span> in 2006 for $174 million. A former lawyer, he pleaded guilty to four felony counts in 1997 and served part of a 33-month sentence for falsely inflating legal bills to the federal government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hedge-fund manager Kenneth Griffin set the current Miami sale-price record when he bought a spread at Faena House for $60 million; it is back on the market for $73 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'Baby On Board' Mogul Lists Miami Beach Estate</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is the house babies built: A sprawling Miami Beach estate created by the man who popularized the "Baby on Board" sign is going on the market for $29.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Lerner, 62, said he started building the house about three years ago and recently moved in, but decided to sell because he's relocating to Palm Beach. "If I could pick it up and move it over to Palm Beach, I would," said Mr. Lerner, a Boston native who moved to Florida about 10 years ago. He said that his plans changed during the building process, adding: "Three years is a long time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On roughly 1 acre, the property has about 105 feet of waterfront and a private dock on Indian Creek, according to Eloy Carmenate of <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</span>, who has the listing with colleague Mick Duchon. Measuring about 12,600 square feet, the five-bedroom main house has an elevator and a safe room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside there is a roughly 80-foot-long swimming pool, a four-bedroom guesthouse and a gazebo with its own kitchen and fireplace. The house is fully furnished, and the furniture is included in the asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to public records Mr. Lerner bought the land for $4.95 million in 2013. He declined to say how much he spent building the house. "It was a lot more than I thought it was going to be," he said with a laugh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the success of its Baby on Board signs -- which were popular in the 1980s -- Mr. Lerner's company, Safety 1st, went on to manufacture child-proofing products. Safety 1st was acquired in 2000 by Canadian company <span class="companylink">Dorel Industries</span>, and Mr. Lerner said he is now largely retired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tech Executives List Onetime</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Penthouse of Gregory Hines</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A duplex penthouse in New York's West Village once owned by tap dancer and actor Gregory Hines is listing for $6.995 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roughly 3,500 square feet, the apartment is located on the top floor of a four-story prewar co-op. With four bedrooms plus staff quarters and an office, the apartment has a living room with roughly 19-foot-high ceilings and a roof deck with views of the Hudson River, according to listing agent Kathleen Manikowski of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sellers are technology executives Jackie Reses and Matthew Apfel. Ms. Reses is a former chief development officer at Yahoo who now heads the small-business lending program at payments company, Square. "It's an edgy, old-school West Village building," Ms. Reses said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Apfel heads video programming for <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s virtual-reality team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Reses said the prior owner was Mr. Hines, who won a Tony Award in 1992 for his performance in "Jelly's Last Jam." Mr. Hines and his second wife, Pam Koslow, bought the apartment for about $300,000 in the early 1980s and used it as their primary residence, Ms. Koslow said, although at the end of his life Mr. Hines spent much of his time in Los Angeles. He died in 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Reses said she and her husband, who have three children, extensively renovated the home. "We turned it into a family apartment," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Reses said the couple is selling because they relocated to California in 2013, after she was hired at <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span>. They leased the apartment after they first moved, but are now ready to sell it. "It's hard to maintain an apartment like that when you're not local," Ms. Reses said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In San Francisco, Former</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consulate Asks $22 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A San Francisco mansion long used as a consulate for the Egyptian government is asking $22 million, making it one of the city's most expensive residential properties on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Located in the affluent Pacific Heights neighborhood, the roughly 14,000-square-foot structure was designed by the architecture firm Bliss and Faville after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, said listing agent Nina Hatvany of Pacific Union International, who shares the listing with colleague Mary Toboni.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A buyer will most likely use the property as a single-family home, Ms. Hatvany said. She noted that a new owner will almost certainly make some changes to the layout. When the building was a consulate, the third and fourth floors were used as a residence, while the lower floors were used for offices, meetings and entertaining. It has three kitchens: one in the basement for catering events, a prep kitchen on the main floor and one in the residence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Egyptian government bought the house in 1960, according to public records, and used it as the consulate general for San Francisco. Egypt has since moved the consular operation to Los Angeles, according to the website of the Embassy of the Arab Republic of Egypt.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1976, Abba rocked the radio, Gerald Ford was president, and Leonard Ross purchased one of the most expensive homes in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ross, an attorney and real-estate investor, bought the roughly 30,000-square-foot Beverly Hills, Calif., estate of newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst for about $1.7 million at a time when the median home price was $38,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People asked, 'Why are you buying a house that big?'" said Mr. Ross, who was single at the time and living with his German shepherd, Lark. "I said, 'I'm family oriented. I'll grow into it.'" Mr. Ross, who grew up poor on New York's Lower East Side in the 1950s, said he bought the mansion in part because it was a trophy property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forty years later, Mr. Ross, 72, is listing the 5-acre compound, including the now 50,000-square-foot mansion, for $195 million -- which would be a record sale price in Los Angeles, where the Playboy mansion recently sold for $100 million. Adjusted for inflation, that's a compound annual growth rate of 8.7%. The S&amp;P 500 stock-market index averaged an inflation-adjusted annualized return of just 4.1%. That doesn't factor in carrying costs or improvements, but neither does it account for Mr. Ross occasionally renting the space for upward of $600,000 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In luxury real estate, good things often come to those who wait. The number of years that home buyers remain in their home is at a record high, in part because of lingering uncertainty in the housing market. For those who can afford to play the long game -- 15, 20, 30 years -- staying put can mean a windfall when they finally make a move. But buyer beware: Time isn't always on your side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Yvonne Dunleavy, the quiet village of Sagaponack, N.Y., in the Hamptons seemed like a smart place to buy property in 1978, when she purchased a modest home there for $140,000. Now she and her husband, architect Joost Schiereck, are listing the 1,800-square-foot modern home for $5.75 million, for a compound annual growth rate of 6.61%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't see it as a luxury house -- a luxury location, certainly," said Ms. Dunleavy, co-author of "The Happy Hooker," about an Upper East Side madam. Over the years, she watched the sleepy vacation community become a hot spot for the jet set. In the 1990s, she rented the home to John F. Kennedy Jr. and some of his family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices are still climbing in the area. A neighbor who bought a similar property recently sold for about $5.5 million this summer. The new owner promptly demolished that home to make way for an as-yet-unbuilt modernist spec house, which is already listed for $16.995 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All told, Ms. Dunleavy estimates spending $350,000 on renovations over the past 40 years, including the addition of a new wing, some new sliding glass doors, adding a pool, and replacing the roof and kitchen. The couple is selling the home because they'd like to travel more. "It was sheer luck," she said about buying when she did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lot can change over the course of homeownership. In an analysis of four metro areas -- New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Cleveland -- Realtor.com tracked the sale prices of about 11,600 homes that were sold in 2000 and again in 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most expensive market, Los Angeles, saw a median price gain of 141%, or $320,500 in the 16-year period. Adjusted for inflation, that translates to a compound annual growth rate of 3.5%. New York saw an annual growth rate of 1.2%; Atlanta shrank 0.6%; and Cleveland fell 2.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a function of strong local economies," said Javier Vivas, an economic researcher for Realtor.com. He also notes that speculators have pushed prices higher in surging markets. While Cleveland saw a decline in that period, he said the luxury tier fared best, in part because affluent buyers are less prone to market fluctuations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wait long enough, though, and the peaks and valleys seem less important. In San Francisco, Ed McGuirk, 65, and his family are selling an eight-bedroom Victorian home for $6.95 million; his grandfather bought it for $30,000 in 1926.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That was a ton of money back then," said Mr. McGuirk, a retired schoolteacher. "But now it's skyrocketed in price." He, along with his siblings and a cousin, are selling the roughly 5,100-square-foot home because they all live elsewhere; his aunt, the last owner, died in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike most homes in the area, the Queen Anne-style home still has most of its original layout, with 12-foot ceilings and grand parlors. In the basement, his grandfather's Prohibition-era bar is still intact. Behind a mirror is a passageway that led into the front yard -- presumably to make a quick escape from police, he said. He used to play in the tunnel as a child. (It has since been sealed to elude more likely raiders -- neighborhood raccoons.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home was listed in September for just under $7.5 million and reduced to $6.95 million in October.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1976, Abba rocked the radio, Gerald Ford was president, and Leonard Ross purchased one of the most expensive homes in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ross, an attorney and real-estate investor, bought the roughly 30,000-square-foot Beverly Hills, Calif., estate of newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst for about $1.7 million at a time when the median home price was $38,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People asked, ‘Why are you buying a house that big?'" said Mr. Ross, who was single at the time and living with his German shepherd, Lark. "I said, ‘I'm family oriented. I'll grow into it.' " Mr. Ross, who grew up poor on New York's Lower East Side in the 1950s, said he bought the mansion in part because it was a trophy property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forty years later, Mr. Ross, 72, is listing the 5-acre compound[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/william-randolph-hearst-mansion-in-beverly-hills-seeks-195-million-1473198211], including the now 50,000-square-foot mansion, for $195 million—which would be a record sale price in Los Angeles, where the Playboy mansion recently sold for $100 million[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/the-playboy-mansion-sells-to-its-neighbor-for-100-million-1471354451]. Adjusted for inflation, that's a compound annual growth rate of 8.7%. The S&amp;P 500 stock-market index averaged an inflation-adjusted annualized return of just 4.1%. That doesn't factor in carrying costs or improvements, but neither does it account for Mr. Ross occasionally renting the space for upward of $600,000 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In luxury real estate, good things often come to those who wait. The number of years that home buyers remain in their home is at a record high, in part because of lingering uncertainty in the housing market[http://graphics.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/housing-market-recovery/]. For those who can afford to play the long game—15, 20, 30 years—staying put can mean a windfall when they finally make a move. But buyer beware: Time isn't always on your side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Yvonne Dunleavy, the quiet village of Sagaponack, N.Y., in the Hamptons seemed like a smart place to buy property in 1978, when she purchased a modest home there for $140,000. Now she and her husband, architect Joost Schiereck, are listing the 1,800-square-foot modern home[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/in-the-hamptons-a-home-thats-an-investment-in-peace-and-quiet-1475593518] for $5.75 million, for a compound annual growth rate of 6.61%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't see it as a luxury house—a luxury location, certainly," said Ms. Dunleavy, co-author of "The Happy Hooker," about an Upper East Side madam. Over the years, she watched the sleepy vacation community become a hot spot for the jet set. In the 1990s, she rented the home to John F. Kennedy Jr. and some of his family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices are still climbing in the area. A neighbor who bought a similar property recently sold for about $5.5 million this summer. The new owner promptly demolished that home to make way for an as-yet-unbuilt modernist spec house, which is already listed for $16.995 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All told, Ms. Dunleavy estimates spending $350,000 on renovations over the past 40 years, including the addition of a new wing, some new sliding glass doors, adding a pool, and replacing the roof and kitchen. The couple is selling the home because they'd like to travel more. "It was sheer luck," she said about buying when she did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lot can change over the course of homeownership. In an analysis of four metro areas—New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Cleveland—Realtor.com tracked the sale prices of about 11,600 homes that were sold in 2000 and again in 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most expensive market, Los Angeles, saw a median price gain of 141%, or $320,500 in the 16-year period. Adjusted for inflation, that translates to a compound annual growth rate of 3.5%. New York saw an annual growth rate of 1.2%; Atlanta shrank 0.6%; and Cleveland fell 2.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a function of strong local economies," said Javier Vivas, an economic researcher for Realtor.com. He also notes that speculators have pushed prices higher in surging markets. While Cleveland saw a decline in that period, he said the luxury tier fared best, in part because affluent buyers are less prone to market fluctuations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wait long enough, though, and the peaks and valleys seem less important. In San Francisco, Ed McGuirk, 65, and his family are selling an eight-bedroom Victorian home for $6.95 million; his grandfather bought it for $30,000 in 1926.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That was a ton of money back then," said Mr. McGuirk, a retired schoolteacher. "But now it's skyrocketed in price." He, along with his siblings and a cousin, are selling the roughly 5,100-square-foot home because they all live elsewhere; his aunt, the last owner, died in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike most homes in the area, the Queen Anne-style home still has most of its original layout, with 12-foot ceilings and grand parlors. In the basement, his grandfather's Prohibition-era bar is still intact. Behind a mirror is a passageway that led into the front yard—presumably to make a quick escape from police, he said. He used to play in the tunnel as a child. (It has since been sealed to elude more likely raiders—neighborhood raccoons.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home was listed in September for just under $7.5 million and reduced to $6.95 million in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners are staying in their homes longer—a median of 10 years, the longest tenure since at least 1985, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. Chief economist Lawrence Yun said the shift is partly due to an aging society and tight inventory in many markets[http://topics.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/subject/H/Housing-Inventory/2942].

</div><div class="author">By Stefanos Chen </div><div>434 words</div><div>1 December 2016</div><div>11:31</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications: Minneapolis was among the top destinations searched by internet users with Chinese IP addresses, with 88 page views for the 12 months through October. An earlier version of a chart accompanying this article said Minneapolis had 99 page views. (12/01/2016)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forget San Francisco. The next stop for jet-setting Chinese home buyers could be Walla Walla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Washington city, about 4½ hours outside of Seattle, is among a number of lesser-known U.S. real-estate markets getting attention from Chinese internet users, according to an analysis of online search traffic to <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty Affiliates</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most popular U.S. markets, by volume of Chinese web traffic to the site, were Southampton, N.Y.; Houston; Brooklyn, N.Y.; Lake Whitingham, Vt., and Monterey, Fla. The company tracked traffic from Chinese IP addresses to the site for 12 months through October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're starting to see that the Chinese are looking in college towns[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/SB10001424052702303779504579467522202091120]—this is a newer phenomenon," said John Passerini, Sotheby's global vice president of interactive marketing, adding that Chinese web visitors represent the largest group outside of the U.S., over 1 million unique visitors, or roughly 10% of total traffic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in traffic to smaller markets, like College Place, Wash., a city in Walla Walla County and home to a local university, suggests that Chinese buyers are looking for alternatives to more competitive luxury markets. The most popular search criteria used by Chinese browsers were "waterfront," "gated community" and "green home."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the fourth straight year, the Chinese outspent all other foreign buyers of U.S. real estate combined, with a sales volume of $27.3 billion—more than three times the amount spent by the next biggest group [http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/chinese-buyers-replace-canadians-as-top-foreign-buyers-of-u-s-homes-1434580337]of foreign buyers, Canadians, according to a July report from the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. The Chinese also buy more expensive homes—a median price of $542,084, compared with the U.S. median of $223,058 for existing home sales. (<span class="companylink">News Corp</span>, which owns The Wall Street Journal, also owns Realtor.com, the listing website of the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Danville, Calif., in the San Francisco Bay Area, Andrew Greenwell of Venture Sotheby's is selling a $4.788 million equestrian estate with a 6,000-square-foot home. With 1,396 page views from China in the past year, it is one of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> most popular listings with Chinese browsers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They like newer construction and great schools," said Mr. Greenwell, who notes that some Chinese clients have bought homes specifically to enroll their children in top-rated private schools.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Candace Taylor </div><div>401 words</div><div>1 December 2016</div><div>14:19</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawyer-turned-entrepreneur William Duker is putting his Miami Beach penthouse on the market for $65 million. If it fetches its asking price, the property will set a new record for a residential sale in the Miami area, according to listing agent Carlo Gambino of <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The penthouse spans the 22nd, 23rd and 24th floors of the Apogee, a waterfront condo tower at the southern tip of Miami Beach. The apartment has more outdoor space than interior space, Mr. Gambino said. Much of the 24th floor is a roof deck containing an outdoor swimming pool and hot tub, as well as an outdoor kitchen and a movie screen. There are wraparound terraces on all three floors, for a total of roughly 13,150 square feet of outdoor space. With views of the ocean, Biscayne Bay and the Miami skyline, the five-bedroom apartment's interior is about 8,300 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Duker bought the penthouse in 2008 for $16.5 million, according to public records. He said he spent about three years renovating it. He built a spiral glass staircase in the double-height living room to create the effect of "walking on air," he said. The apartment also has a private interior elevator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Duker said he usually spends about two months a year at the penthouse; he also has homes in New York City, in upstate New York and in Rome. He said he is selling because he's planning to travel around the world in his new 230-foot yacht, Sybaris.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Duker owns the software company Rational Enterprise. He was one of the founders of <span class="companylink">Amici LLC</span>, a provider of document-discovery services, which was acquired by Xerox in 2006[http://blogs.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/law/2006/06/15/xerox-acquires-amici-a-banner-day-for-the-boies-brood/] for $174 million. A former lawyer, he pleaded guilty to four felony counts[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/SB875568238528235000] in 1997 and served part of a 33-month sentence [http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/SB881802616523635000]for falsely inflating legal bills to the federal government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hedge-fund manager Kenneth Griffin set the current Miami sale-price record when he bought a spread at Faena House for $60 million[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/miami-beach-condo-sells-for-record-60-million-1443045705]; it is back on the market for $73 million.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charlotte Officer Cleared in Shooting</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prosecutors on Wednesday said a Charlotte police officer acted appropriately in the September fatal shooting of a black man that sparked violent protests in the city, as a two-month investigation showed the man, Keith Lamont Scott, was holding a loaded gun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brentley Vinson, an officer with the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department, won't be criminally charged, Charlotte District Attorney R. Andrew Murray said at a Wednesday press conference. Mr. Vinson is also black.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Scott's family has said he was holding a book while waiting for his child at a bus stop on Sept. 20. But prosecutors said "no reading book was found" in Mr. Scott's vehicle, and radio traffic, video surveillance and interviews with police officers on the scene indicate he was holding a cocked and loaded handgun, Mr. Murray said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Vinson, who has two years' experience on the force, was one of two officers conducting surveillance Sept. 20 in an apartment-complex parking lot in suburban Charlotte. The officers were parked near Mr. Scott, 43 years old, and saw that he had marijuana and a gun, according to police reports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The officers put on vests that identified themselves as police, and were joined by other officers, according to police and to dash-cam footage. The officers approached Mr. Scott's SUV and told him 10 times to "drop the gun," the prosecutor said.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investigators analyzed the dash-cam, body-cam, cellphone footage and other video, but no recordings "clearly capture Mr. Scott's hands," Mr. Murray said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—The number of homes that went under contract inched higher in October, a sign the housing market could be plateauing in the final months of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Wednesday that its pending home sales index, which tracks contract signings for previously owned homes, edged up 0.1% from a downwardly revised September reading to a seasonally adjusted 110.0. Sales typically close within a month or two of signing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home sales likely have peaked," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He said buyers have been trying to lock in low mortgage rates in recent weeks before they head higher, but that pattern won't hold for long.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We expect home sales clearly to fall in the first quarter," Mr. Shepherdson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">October's reading was 1.8% above where the index stood in October a year ago, and the highest since July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the housing market is facing a number of headwinds, including rising mortgage rates, home price appreciation that has outpaced most workers' wage gains, and limited inventory. In September, U.S. home prices climbed back[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-home-prices-set-a-record-in-september-case-shiller-says-1480428083] above the record reached more than a decade ago, according to the S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price index released Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowing costs were still low in October. The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in October was 3.47%, below the October 2015 average of 3.80%, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. But the average rate on a 30-year fixed conforming mortgage has risen[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/rising-mortgage-rates-help-but-also-hurt-banks-1480266809] to 4.16%, according to the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>, up from post-Brexit lows around 3.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daniel Silver, an economist at <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co</span>., said the key question "is what will happen to the housing market following the increase in rates that occurred since early in November."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">News Corp</span>, owner of The Wall Street Journal, also operates Realtor.com under license from the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pending-home sales report showed the index rose in all four regions of the country since October 2015, with the strongest annual growth in the Northeast. Lawrence Yun, the trade group's chief economist, said 40% of October's sales were at or above their listed price, a rise from 33% last October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other indicators of the housing market's health have been fairly positive in recent months, and the labor market continues to expand, underpinning demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of existing homes, which account for roughly 90% of U.S. homebuying activity, rose in October for a second straight month[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-highest-since-february-2007-1479827703] to hit an annual rate of 5.60 million, the strongest monthly reading since February 2007, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said last week. But the median price of an existing home sold in October was $232,200, up 6.0% on the year, a steep rise that for many workers outpaces annual wage gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of newly built single-family homes[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-new-home-sales-fall-in-october-1479914130] were well up through October, compared with the first 10 months of 2015, the Commerce Department said in a separate report released last week. But supplies of those properties remain limited, one factor putting upward pressure on existing-home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates could continue to rise if, as many economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal predict, <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> officials raise interest rates at their December policy meeting. That could curb enthusiasm for home buying.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices have climbed back above the record reached more than a decade ago, bringing to a close the worst period for the housing market since the Great Depression and stoking optimism for a more sustainable expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average home price for September was 0.1% above the July 2006 peak, according to the S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index released Tuesday. The previous month's reading of the Case-Shiller index, a widely used benchmark for U.S. housing, showed prices remained 0.1% below the 2006 record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adjusted for inflation, the index still is about 16% below the 2006 high. Home prices jumped 5.5% over the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The record caps a four-year recovery from the trough of 2012, when prices sat 27% below the peak after a crash that caused more than nine million American families to lose their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's good news for homeowners out there, especially ones who were able to cling on to their homes," said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Zillow, a real-estate research firm. "They saw one of the biggest assets that they had lose a ton of savings."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while prices have recovered, the market is flashing caution signs. The country is building far fewer homes than normal, the homeownership rate is near a five-decade low, and mortgages remain difficult to come by, especially for less-affluent buyers. Rising mortgage rates could also begin to pose headwinds to further price growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price growth has also outpaced income gains, making it more likely that the current rate of appreciation is unsustainable. Home prices have grown at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 5.9% since 2012, while incomes have grown by just 1.3%, according to Case-Shiller. By contrast, from 1975 until the present, prices grew at a rate of 1.1% a year, while per-capita incomes grew 1.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, while housing has lagged behind some sectors of the economy in recent years, there are signs of increasing strength. Single-family housing starts rose 11% in October, according to the Commerce Department, and the number of starts remains well below the historical average, suggesting room for acceleration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Likewise, the share of first-time buyers rose to 33% in October from 31% a year earlier, inching closer to the historical average of 40%. A lack of first-time buyers had been a drag on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Shiller, an economist at Yale University who co-developed the index, said the record provides a significant psychological boost for homeowners, some of whom are finally seeing their homes above water after four years of recovery. About 12% of homeowners who have a mortgage now owe more than their home is worth, down from more than 30% at the bottom of the market, according to Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists are surprised by the magnitude of the home-price gains in recent years, given the more moderate pace of wage growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not clear with the degree of [economic] growth that we've had that we should have expected prices to rise this much," said Doug Duncan, chief economist at mortgage-finance company <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>. "We have a caution light on."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are signs that lenders aren't making loans to thousands of people who pose little credit risk. Under typical conditions, similar to those in the early 2000s, about 12% of mortgages are at risk of default, but in the second quarter of 2016, just 5% of mortgages were at risk of default, according to the <span class="companylink">Urban Institute</span>, a nonpartisan policy research group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing recovery since 2012 has been uneven, often disproportionately benefiting wealthier homeowners and those in some of the largest cities. Such markets are the focus of the Case-Shiller study. Zillow's home-price index, which covers a wider range of markets, is still 2.7% below the peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slow recovery in many regions, particularly for lower-value homes, helped energize insurgent political campaigns by Sen. Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump, culminating in Mr. Trump's victory in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just 34 of the largest 100 metropolitan areas have seen starter-home prices recover to their previous peak, while 56 areas have seen high-end homes reach or surpass past highs, according to home-tracker <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Personally I wouldn't be throwing confetti because my house is worth what I paid for it back eight years ago," said Nela Richardson, chief economist at real-estate brokerage Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, in many parts of the country, a return to near-normal conditions has come as welcome relief. The median home value in Lehigh Acres, Fla., on the eastern edge of Fort Myers, bottomed at about $61,000 in February 2011 after peaking at $230,500 in July 2006, according to Zillow. Today, the median home price has risen to about $140,000, and Fort Myers now has a shortage of starter homes, said Mayor Randall Henderson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the national recovery has allowed longtime homeowners to sell and relocate, making the U.S. labor force more mobile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dan Tanner, 58, sold his home in Savannah, Ga., in 2007 for just over $300,000 -- nearly a $100,000 profit in just a few years. He plowed the gains into two condominiums, one in Savannah and another in Atlanta. The value of both homes fell 25% within a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tanner eventually sold the Savannah condo at a $30,000 loss, but held on to the Atlanta property. "A friend of mine was like, 'You made a commitment, you should stick to it,' " he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Mr. Tanner plans to sell the Atlanta condo for more than he paid, as prices in that market are about 3% below their July 2007 peak and 60% above the low in March 2012.</p>

Rising mortgage rates[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/mortgage-rates-highest-since-july-15-1479697488] could also begin to pose headwinds to further price growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price growth has also outpaced income gains, making it more likely that the current rate of appreciation is unsustainable. Home prices have grown at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 5.9% since 2012, while incomes have grown by just 1.3%, according to Case-Shiller. By contrast, from 1975 until the present, prices grew at a rate of 1.1% a year, while per-capita incomes grew 1.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, while housing has lagged behind some sectors of the economy in recent years, there are signs of gaining strength: Single-family housing starts[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-housing-starts-rose-in-october-1479389564] rose 11% in October, according to the Commerce Department, and the number of starts remains well below the historical average, suggesting there is room for acceleration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Likewise, the share of first-time buyers rose to 33% in October from 31% a year earlier, inching closer to the historical average of 40%. The lack of first-time buyers had been a drag on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Shiller, an economist at Yale University who co-developed the index, said the record provides a significant psychological boost for homeowners, some of whom are finally seeing their homes above water after four years of recovery. About 12% of homeowners who have a mortgage now owe more than their home is worth, down from more than 30% at the bottom of the market, according to Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists are surprised by the magnitude of the home-price gains in recent years, given the more moderate pace of wage growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not clear with the degree of [economic] growth that we've had that we should have expected prices to rise this much," said Doug Duncan, chief economist at mortgage company <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>. "We have a caution light on."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are signs that lenders aren't making loans to thousands of people who pose little credit risk. Under typical conditions, similar to those in the early 2000s, about 12% of mortgages are at risk of default, but in the second quarter of 2016, just 5% of mortgages were at risk of default.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing recovery since 2012 has been uneven, often disproportionately benefiting wealthier homeowners and those in some of the largest cities. Such markets are the focus of the Case-Shiller study. Zillow's home-price index, which covers a wider range of markets, is still 2.7% below the peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median home values in urban areas across the U.S. were just 0.6% below the previous peak as of the end of 2015, while median home values in rural areas were nearly 6% below the peak, and those in suburban areas were nearly 7% below the peak, according to Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slow recovery from the bust in many regions, particularly for lower-value homes, energized insurgent political campaigns by Sen. Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump, culminating in Mr. Trump's victory in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just 34 of the largest 100 metropolitan areas have seen starter-home prices recover to their previous peak, while 56 areas have seen high-end homes reach or surpass previous highs, according to home-tracker <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Personally I wouldn't be throwing confetti because my house is worth what I paid for it back eight years ago," said Nela Richardson, chief economist at real-estate brokerage Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, in many parts of the country, a return to near-normal conditions has come as welcome relief, and faster than many expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home value in Lehigh Acres, Fla., on the eastern edge of Fort Myers, bottomed at about $61,000 after peaking at $230,500 in July 2006, according to Zillow. Today, the median home price has risen to about $140,000, and Fort Myers now has a shortage of starter homes, said Mayor Randall Henderson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the national recovery has allowed longtime homeowners to sell and relocate, making the U.S. labor force more mobile than it has been in years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dan Tanner, 58 years old, sold his home in Savannah, Ga., in 2007 for just over $300,000, nearly a $100,000 profit in just a few years. He plowed the gains into two condominiums, one in Savannah and another in Atlanta. The value of both homes dropped by 25% within a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tanner eventually sold the Savannah condo at a $30,000 loss, but held on to the Atlanta property. "A friend of mine was like, ‘You made a commitment, you should stick to it,' " he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Mr. Tanner plans to sell the Atlanta condo for more than he paid, as home prices in that market are about 3% below their July 2007 peak and 60% above the recent low hit in March 2012, according to Case-Shiller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recovery also has produced a few big winners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeremy Mann, a 31-year-old doctoral student, and his wife, Erin, a nurse practitioner, bought a home in 2011 as the market was bottoming out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"[We realized] we could buy a house now even though we thought that was five or 10 years in the future," Mr. Mann said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Manns purchased a rundown building in an up-and-coming area of Chicago for just $310,000, with a $1,600 monthly mortgage payment. The building was big enough for them to rent out several units, covering the mortgage payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the couple had the home appraised a few years ago, the value had increased to $425,000. They were able to refinance and use the money for a down payment on a new home, holding on to the original property as an investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moves helped give Mr. Mann the financial freedom to work on starting a school for underprivileged children, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not like we were so savvy in home buying or that we were real-estate mogul people," he said. "We really feel like we've been blessed."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing's lost decade is finally over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has reached its long-anticipated new milestone: U.S. home prices finally topped record levels for the first time since July 2006, according to the S&amp;P <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> Case-Shiller Index released this week. Rock-bottom interest rates and accommodative monetary policy helped push home values higher. But now comes the hard part: sustaining prices in a period of rising rates. There is reason for optimism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's report on October pending home sales, a key indicator from the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> that measures buying momentum of previously owned homes, should be decent. It will show activity one month prior to the election and before mortgage rates started climbing. The pending home-sales index is based on signed contracts, making it a leading indicator of sorts for the broader housing market. Home sales typically close weeks or months after signing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While pending home sales spiked in April, they have been choppy ever since, buffeted by tight inventory and low mortgage rates. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal expect a 0.1% rise in October from a month earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recent data suggest home buyers rushed to get mortgages before rates rose further. Applications for mortgages to purchase homes jumped 13% in the week ended Nov. 18, one of the biggest increases of the year, according to the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>. That comes as mortgage rates have climbed above 4%, hovering near the highestin 17 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While mortgage rates are up, they remain very low by historical standards. And rising rates during prosperous economic times don't necessarily mean home prices have to fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A study by <span class="companylink">John Burns Real Estate Consulting Inc</span>. examined 10 instances over the past four decades in which mortgage rates rose by at least 1 percentage point. It found prices weren't especially sensitive to rising rates, particularly in the presence of other positive economic factors, such as strong job growth, rising wages and improving consumer confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the bursting of the housing bubble and the financial crisis to prices bottoming in 2012 and the ensuing recovery, rising home values have ushered in hope that the housing expansion is poised to kick into a new gear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if rates rise further, it isn't last call yet for the house party.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in the U.S. have climbed back above the record reached more than a decade ago, bringing to a close the worst period for the housing market since the Great Depression and stoking optimism for a more sustainable expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average home price for September was 0.1% above the July 2006 peak, according to the S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price index released Tuesday. As of the previous month's reading of the Case-Shiller index, a widely used benchmark for U.S. housing, prices remained 0.1% below the July 2006 record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adjusted for inflation, the index still is about 16% below the 2006 high. Home prices jumped 5.5% over the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data coincided with revised figures from the Commerce Department that showed gross domestic product grew at a 3.2% annual rate in the third quarter, better than the preliminary estimate of 2.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. corporate profits were also strong, rising 9.9% from the second quarter after taxes but not adjusted for inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home-price record caps a four-year recovery from the trough of 2012, when prices sat 27% below the peak after a crash that caused more than nine million American families to lose their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's good news for homeowners out there, especially ones who were able to cling on to their homes," said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Zillow, a real-estate research firm. "They saw one of the biggest assets that they had lose a ton of savings."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While prices have recovered, the market is flashing caution signs. The country is building far fewer homes than normal, the homeownership rate is near a five-decade low, and mortgages remain difficult to come by, especially for less-affluent buyers.

The lack of first-time buyers had been a drag on the market because, without a deep pool of ready buyers of starter homes, owners of those homes have a harder time trading up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Shiller, an economist at Yale University who co-developed the index, said the record provides a significant psychological boost for homeowners, some of whom are finally seeing their homes above water after four years of recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It creates an atmosphere that the sky is the limit," he said.</p>

"We have a caution light on."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason home prices have risen so quickly is a prolonged period of ultralow interest rates. Those rates have jumped about half a percentage point this month, and while they remain near historic lows, a sustained rise could slow price gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing recovery since 2012 has been uneven, often benefiting wealthier homeowners disproportionately.

In fact, Fort Myers now has a shortage of starter homes, said Mayor Randall Henderson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the national recovery has allowed longtime homeowners to sell and relocate, making the U.S. labor force more mobile than it has been in years.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tanner sold the Savannah condo at a $30,000 loss, but held on to the Atlanta property even when the balance of his mortgage exceeded the property's value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A friend of mine was like, 'You made a commitment, you should stick to it,' " he said. "I saw other people do it and I just couldn't, I just couldn't do it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Mr. Tanner plans to sell the Atlanta condo for more than he paid, as home prices in that market are about 3% below their July 2007 peak and 60% above the recent low hit in March 2012, according to Case-Shiller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recovery also has produced a few big winners who timed the market especially well. Many of those prescient enough to get in early have quickly built thousands of dollars in equity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeremy Mann, a 31-year-old doctoral student, and his wife, Erin, a nurse practitioner, bought a home in 2011 when they were just a few years out of college -- something they never imagined would be possible until the market bottomed out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Manns moved to Chicago from Los Angeles after graduation and were paying $1,300 a month in rent. They wanted to live near friends from their church and realized it would be cheaper to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They purchased a run-down building in an up-and-coming area for just $310,000, with a $1,600 monthly mortgage payment. The building was big enough for them to rent out several units, covering the mortgage payment.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While mortgage rates are up, they remain very low by historical standards. And rising rates during prosperous economic times don't necessarily mean home prices have to fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A study by <span class="companylink">John Burns Real Estate Consulting Inc</span>. examined 10 instances over the past four decades in which mortgage rates rose by at least 1 percentage point. It found prices weren't especially sensitive to rising rates, particularly in the presence of other positive economic factors, such as strong job growth, rising wages and improving consumer confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the bursting of the housing bubble and the financial crisis to prices bottoming in 2012 and the ensuing recovery, rising home values have ushered hope that the housing expansion is poised to kick into a new gear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if rates rise further, it isn't last call yet for the house party.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Chris Kirkham </div><div>564 words</div><div>28 November 2016</div><div>14:28</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing units earmarked for low-income residents have virtually no impact on surrounding property values in major U.S. metro areas, according to an analysis of home-price data that runs counter to the conventional view that such projects cause nearby property values to decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The findings, from real-estate tracker <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, looked at more than 3,000 projects financed using the federal low-income housing tax credit program between 1996 and 2006 in the 20 most expensive U.S. metro areas. <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> researchers measured the change in home values for properties within a 2,000-foot radius of the low-income units as well as an outer ring between 2,000 and 4,000 feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the 20 metro areas, the study found no significant difference in price per square foot when looking at properties closest to the low-income units and those farther out. The 20 markets chosen are the ones with the highest percentage of a median household's income needed to pay toward a monthly mortgage payment on the median home value in each market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cheryl Young, a senior economist at <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> who worked on the study, said the data present a "challenge to this prevailing argument around low-income housing, and shows there really isn't an effect."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The majority of metro areas in the study, which included most coastal markets in California, along with New York City, Miami, Denver and the Pacific Northwest, saw no significant differences in prices after low-income housing was built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were a few exceptions: In Boston and Cambridge, Mass., home values closest to low-income housing increased at a slower pace than the area slightly farther away, amounting to a difference of between $18 and $19 per square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Denver, the opposite happened: Prices for homes closest to the low-income housing grew at a faster rate than the more distant ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the Boston area, the study concluded that many of the low-income housing tax-credit projects were concentrated in a few submarkets where prices already were depressed. In Denver, many of the projects were in downtown areas that saw a major turnaround beginning in the 1990s, which could explain the increase in property values near the low-income units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> study focused on the 10 years before 2006 to ensure there were enough years to study the trends before and after low-income units were completed, and to avoid distortion from the real-estate bust after 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other research has shown that low-income housing has little negative impact on surrounding property values, and sometimes can have a positive effect. The studies show that the type of construction and location is important: Large concentrations of low-income units in already-distressed areas will likely cause a deterioration in prices, while a less concentrated approach in more stable neighborhoods leads to a boost in property values across the board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For well-designed, reasonably scaled projects that are well-maintained and managed, there's really no evidence that they have a negative impact," said Ingrid Gould Ellen, director of the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at <span class="companylink">New York University</span>.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rapid rise in interest rates since Election Day is taking a toll on the mortgage market, and lenders are scrambling to adjust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Donald Trump's surprise victory, average rates for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage have leapt by more than half a point, to 4.18% on Wednesday. Rates still remain low by historical standards, but are now at their highest level since June 2015, according to MortgageNewsDaily.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fast rise in rates has spurred homeowners to pull back from refinancing mortgages. Applications dropped 3% in the week ended Nov. 18 from the prior one, the seventh consecutive weekly decline, and the second since Election Day, according to data released Wednesday by the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The MBA estimates refinances will fall 46% next year, to $484 billion, which will hurt Americans' ability to free up cash by reducing the cost of their monthly mortgages. The fall in refinances also will hit an important area of consumer-loan growth for banks. To slow the possible damage, banks already are pitching riskier loans that come with adjustable interest rates or allow borrowers to pull more equity out of their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The increase in rate has shocked consumers . . . I didn't expect it either," said Dave Norris, chief revenue officer at <span class="companylink">LoanDepot</span>, the 10th-largest mortgage lender in the U.S. by loan volume.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The impact on home buying may be less clear-cut, but some buyers have rushed to lock in terms before rates rise further. In the week ended Nov. 18, applications for mortgages to purchase homes jumped 13% from a week earlier and were up 11% from a year ago, the MBA data showed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually, though, rising rates make houses less affordable, and that could lead to slowing sales, price growth and mortgage activity. Some analysts are now projecting home values will decline by the end of next year in many U.S. housing markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The MBA lowered its projections for next year's new mortgage loans by 3% last week, to $1.58 trillion. That would represent a 16% drop from the nearly $1.9 trillion in mortgages that lenders are on pace to originate this year, with refinancing accounting for all of the drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is little reason to hope "the refi market will be large next year," said Greg Gwizdz, national sales manager for Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, a unit of <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo &amp; Co</span>., the nation's largest mortgage lender by loan volume.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This month's rate increase has eliminated a large share of borrowers for whom refinancing would make financial sense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response, lenders are revising strategies for drumming up mortgage demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">LoanDepot</span>'s Mr. Norris said he has been overhearing more conversations about adjustable-rate mortgages, or ARMs, on the independent mortgage lender's sales floor. Should rates continue to rise, the company plans to ramp up advertising significantly early next year to grab more market share in refinancings, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> said its loan officers began talking to borrowers during the past couple of weeks about the benefits of ARMs that have a low fixed-rate for the first few years before fluctuating with interest rates. Buyers who plan to keep their home for about five years, for example, are being advised by Wells's loan officers to get ARMs with a seven-year fixed rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>. is increasing its marketing of home-equity lines of credit for the first quarter of 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conforming-Loan</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Limit Set to Rise</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home buyers soon can purchase a bit more house and still get a conforming mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The limit on loans that qualify as conforming will rise to $424,100 starting in 2017, from $417,000 now, the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> said Wednesday. This is the first increase in the baseline loan limit since 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also up: In pricier markets, such as New York and San Francisco, conforming mortgage limits will move to $636,150, from $625,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A conforming loan is one that meets certain preset criteria that allow <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> to buy a mortgage and package it with others to be sold to investors. Conforming loans often fetch lower interest rates than ones that aren't, which are often called jumbos due to their larger size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increases in the conforming limits are due to rising home prices. The law that created the original baseline loan limit of $417,000 said this figure couldn't be raised until the average price of homes in the U.S. returned to the third-quarter 2007 level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices started declining in 2007, according to the FHFA's home-price index. New numbers from the FHFA's price index showed average home prices had returned above the third-quarter 2007 level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index is now 1.7% higher than it was then.</p>

</div><div class="author">By  Anna Louie Sussman </div><div>877 words</div><div>23 November 2016</div><div>11:42</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Sales of newly built homes edged down in October, a sign the housing market could be losing momentum in the closing months of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of new single-family homes fell 1.9% in October from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 563,000, the Commerce Department said Wednesday, well below the 595,000 forecast by economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales had hit a multiyear high in July at a pace of 622,000 but have stayed below the 600,000 mark since then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"New-home sales likely have peaked for this cycle," said economist Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics, citing the "recent spike in mortgage rates—which has further to go."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the slowdown from the summer, sales have been stronger in the later months of the year than in the first quarter. Overall, steady job gains and historically low mortgage rates had supported the housing market throughout 2016, but that may not last as rates rise and job creation slows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through the first 10 months of the year, sales were up 12.7% compared with the same period in 2015. That measure was more consistent with other gauges of the housing market showing improvement through most of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales account for a fairly small slice of U.S. home-buying activity, and sales data can be extremely volatile from month to month. October's decrease from the prior month came with a margin of error of 13.1 percentage points, the Commerce Department said. Sales for September were revised down to a 574,000 pace from an earlier estimate of 593,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This new home-sales data…reveals the potential for some weakness going forward," said analysts at Contingent Macro Advisors LLC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent pace of new-home sales is about half the peak rate reached in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes fell in all regions except the West. The slight uptick in inventory suggests home builders are responding to sustained demand, which pushed down supply in recent months and raised prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's report showed there was a 5.2-month supply of newly built homes available at the end of October, given the current sales pace. The median price of new homes sold in October was $304,500, up from $298,700 a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To some observers, that suggests the housing market will continue its recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home sales are well-positioned for sustained growth in the year ahead," said Brittany Baumann, macro strategist at <span class="companylink">TD Securities Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While the recent jump in mortgage rates may dampen sales activity in the near term, rates remain near historically low levels and barring a significant move higher, sales activity should remain supported by ongoing job growth, rising incomes and a further pickup in single-family residential construction," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes, which account for the bulk of purchases, rose 2.0% in October from the prior month to the highest pace since early 2007, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Tuesday. Sales had softened a bit during the summer months but rebounded in September and October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market's prolonged recovery following the 2007-09 recession was a solid contributor to overall economic growth in recent years. But a pullback in residential investment during the second and third quarters, following eight consecutive quarters of growth, has acted as a drag on the broader economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realtors are looking for new construction to infuse the market with more supply, as inventory of existing homes dwindles and prices rise faster than most peoples' wages. That has created affordability issues, especially for first-time buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-building activity rebounded in October, with starts in single-family and multifamily housing posting increases, and permits edging higher as well, the Commerce Department said last week. Home-builder sentiment also held at an elevated level in November, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> said last week, although construction is still at historically low levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowing costs remain low for prospective home buyers who qualify for loans. The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in October was 3.47%, below the October 2015 average of 3.80%, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. But mortgage rates have already risen since then and may continue to to do so if, as many economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal predict, <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> officials raise interest rates at their December policy meeting. That could further curb enthusiasm for home buying.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial property has been a big winner from years of ultralow interest rates around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now markets are signaling that change might be in the air.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors have been dumping government bonds in Europe, Asia and the U.S., sending prices tumbling. When bond prices fall, real-estate values often follow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commercial-real-estate boom of the past few years has been driven by global investors seeking out returns better than those found in low-yielding bonds. But that dynamic could start reversing, analysts said, as ultrasafe government bonds start to offer yields that make commercial property look less desirable in comparison, given the potential risks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bonds have sold off beyond the U.S. because investors think U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's plans to spend on infrastructure might lead the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> to raise interest rates more aggressively than expected, which in turn could ripple through to other central banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the selloff has been greatest in the U.S., government bond prices are down sharply across the world. Eventually, that could affect property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, interest rates and bond yields remain extremely low. The <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span> lowered its benchmark rate in August to 0.25% -- the lowest in its 322-year history -- from 0.5%, where it had been since 2009.The German 10-year bond is yielding 0.3%, up from negative territory earlier this year, but still well below the nearly 2% yield from three years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the moment, property chiefs and analysts stop short of predicting a sudden global decline in property values. But concerns have been growing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is a danger in real-estate markets that, because of lower-for-longer policies . . . values have not been driven by fundamentals," said Chris Taylor, chief executive at the property arm of <span class="companylink">Hermes Investment Management</span>, the London-based asset-management firm. Mr. Trump's new policy proposals "bring into sharper focus what's been driving real-estate markets."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well before Mr. Trump's victory, worries were mounting that some corners of the global property market were overheating. Office values in London and Hong Kong, as well as New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, are above the peaks hit before the 2008 financial crisis on a price-per-square-foot basis, according to property data firm <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for investors, it is all relative. Despite soaring prices, demand has been strong because of the gap between returns on bonds and property. In the eurozone, commercial property is yielding about 4.5%, while yields on 10-year government bonds are in negative territory, according to property broker <span class="companylink">Cushman &amp; Wakefield</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For real estate, "no one questions the current attractiveness of these yields given the alternatives," said Joe Valente, head of real-estate research at <span class="companylink">J.P.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private-equity global funds have been large net sellers of commercial real estate this year, unloading $19 billion more in property assets than they bought in the first nine months of 2016, with the Americas region "bearing the brunt of that trading activity," according to a report from broker JLL. But investors from Asia and the Mideast were still buyers, the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some European investors think their region looks expensive, Asian institutional investors still see value in property, said David Hutchings, head of European investment strategy at <span class="companylink">Cushman &amp; Wakefield</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nervousness among European investors "is seen as an opportunity," Mr. Hutchings said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors have previously predicted turning points for government bond markets that didn't come to pass. In 2015, yields on 10-year German bonds moved sharply higher but headed lower later in the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Mr. Trump's proposed policies don't materialize, bond markets could return to levels seen earlier this year, analysts said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Esther Fung </div><div>675 words</div><div>22 November 2016</div><div>15:39</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chief executive of CBRE Global Investment Partners is Jeremy Plummer. An earlier version of this article misstated his last name.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CBRE Global Investment Partners said it has invested about $450 million for a 45% stake in a portfolio of West Coast retail property, in a bid to tap into rising consumer spending in a region driven by technology-sector growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Privately held real-estate investment company <span class="companylink">Merlone Geier Partners</span> controls the portfolio of 55 shopping centers and other assets totaling almost 7 million square feet, and will remain the majority owner and operator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CBRE Global Investment Partners will also assume its share of debt for the $1.5 billion portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm disclosed the transaction on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The properties are anchored largely by grocers and other retailers of staples, making them less sensitive to changes in the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The West Coast retail property market is light on supply, and strong consumer spending there should translate to higher rents, said Jeremy Plummer, chief executive officer of CBRE Global Investment Partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The portfolio's occupancy rate stands at only about 85% because some of the assets are being redeveloped, said Paul Sisson, head of the Americas at CBRE Global investment Partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the properties are completed, occupancy should reach 94% to 95%, he said. The strip centers have anchor tenants such as grocery giants <span class="companylink">Safeway</span>, <span class="companylink">Albertsons</span> and Trader Joe's, meaning consumers visit in good times and bad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal comes a week after <span class="companylink">Regency Centers Corp</span>. said it planned to acquire[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/regency-centers-nearing-deal-to-buy-equity-one-for-about-5-billion-1479165527] <span class="companylink">Equity One Inc</span>. for about $5 billion in an all-stock transaction that will create one of the U.S.'s largest shopping-center landlords. The two real-estate investment trusts have large strip-center portfolios around the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hap Stein, CEO of Regency Centers, which is based in Jacksonville, Fla., said the two portfolios are complementary and the deal would result in economies of scale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While properties in areas with high population density and high household incomes are still desirable, overall deal activity in retail real estate this year has been muted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the first 10 months of the year, retail-property transaction volume was $62.9 billion, down 16% from the same period a year earlier, according to data tracker <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>. There was more activity in residential, office and hotel properties, according to the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise of online shopping, along with retailer bankruptcies and overbuilding a decade ago, have driven up vacancies and forced retail property owners and REITs to consolidate and unload underperforming centers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Kmart</span>, which had a huge presence in strip centers, has closed hundreds of stores[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/kmart-to-close-another-64-locations-1474307136] over the years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The headwind is obviously e-commerce, which is disproportionately affecting retail real estate," said Mr. Plummer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some landlords are struggling to re-lease the space, others in better locations have been able to redevelop vacated space and bring in new tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two best categories these days are grade-A malls owned by the largest REITs, which remain strong because their space is still coveted by retailers, and strip centers anchored by grocery stores, which are more impervious to changing shopping habits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in better-located strip centers are commanding prices roughly 23% higher than at the peak of the last market cycle, said Ryan McCullough, an economist at CoStar Group. Weaker centers in suburban locations, by contrast, have seen prices fall by about 50% from their peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a street corner game," said Mr. McCullough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smaller, single-tenant properties with drugstores or quick-service restaurants also have grown as a share of retail property sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Grocery-anchored retail is considered safe by most investors in that the tenants still have clients even in an economic downturn," said Jim Costello, senior vice president at Real Capital Analytics. "Everyone has to eat."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Homebuying activity rose in October for the second straight month[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-rebounded-in-september-1476972399] to a new cyclical high despite rising prices and shrinking inventory, a sign housing demand remains buoyant as the year comes to a close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">October's sales of previously owned homes rose 2.0% over the month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.60 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Tuesday, the strongest pace since February 2007. Sales of previously owned homes in October were up 5.9% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected the sales rate to decline to 5.45 million in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales account for the vast majority of U.S. homebuying activity. After hitting an annual rate of 5.57 million in June, sales softened over most of the third quarter before picking up over the past two months. September's sales pace was revised up slightly to 5.49 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the sector faces challenges ahead, including rising prices, a dwindling supply of inventory and an uptick in mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Going forward, we will apparently have a tug of war with regard to affordability between rising employment and wages on one side and rising home prices and mortgage rates on the other," said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales were up on an annual and monthly basis in all four regions of the country, pointing to a "broad-based" housing recovery, said Lawrence Yun, the NAR's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gus Faucher, deputy chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group, said there was still a "great deal of pent-up demand" out in the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Fundamentals for the housing market are good, with job and income gains and low mortgage rates supporting demand," he said in a note to clients. "Tight supplies could be a near-term constraint, however."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the latest sales pace, it would take 4.3 months to exhaust the supply of previously owned homes on the market, down from 4.8 months in October 2015. Housing inventory has fallen on a year-over-year basis for 17 straight months, <span class="companylink">NAR</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And prices have been rising[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/home-price-surge-stymies-first-time-buyers-1461317401] far faster than wage gains[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-adds-161-000-jobs-in-october-jobless-rate-ticks-down-to-4-9-1478262813]. The median price of an existing home sold in October was $232,200 up 6.0% on the year. Still, people seemed eager to pony up. First-time home buyers accounted for 33% of October sales, according to <span class="companylink">NAR</span>, down from 34% in September, a figure that matched the highest level since July 2012. Distressed sales ticked up 1 percentage point to account for 5% of all sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Stifel Economics Chief Economist Lindsey Piegza cautioned that swiftly rising home prices could leave many would-be buyers priced out, eventually stalling the housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Many potential buyers continue to struggle to accumulate the wealth needed for a down payment, amid moderate job and income growth, which could serve to undermine at least some improvement in residential investment," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market's prolonged recovery following the 2007-09 recession was a solid contributor to overall economic growth in recent years. But a pullback in residential investment during the second and third quarters, following eight consecutive quarters of growth, has acted as a drag on the broader economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, home-building activity rebounded in October, with starts in single-family and multifamily housing posting increases, and permits edging higher as well, the Commerce Department said last week. Home-builder sentiment also held at an elevated level in November, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> said last week, although construction is still at historically low levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department's report on new home sales will be released Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">News Corp</span>, owner of The Wall Street Journal, also operates Realtor.com under license from the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowing costs are still historically low for prospective home buyers who qualify for loans, and it is possible October's rise in home sales reflects a rush to buy ahead of more potential interest rate rises in the future. The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in October was 3.47%, below the October 2015 average of 3.80%, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. But mortgage rates have already risen since then and may continue to, if, as many economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal predict, <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> officials raise interest rates at their December policy meeting. That could further damp enthusiasm for home buying.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese property is losing its fizz again, and commodities bulls should be on guard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Breaking out the champagne too early tends to damp the mood later in the night, a lesson commodity speculators betting on China's overheated property market may be about to relearn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average housing prices in October were up 1.1% from the month before, slowing from September's 1.8% pace, according to official government data out Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deceleration isn't unexpected, given that policy makers have been tightening mortgage restrictions and limiting developers' access to bonds. But it is worrying that the slowdown comes as the prices of metals and coal shoot through the roof, largely in anticipation of another large ramp-up in construction activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction and real-estate investment have been in recovery since late 2015, but anemically -- in contrast to the stratospheric price gains for land and property. With credit easy earlier in the year, the game plan for developers has clearly been to drive up land and property prices as quickly as possible and sell down still-abundant inventory, rather than invest heavily in new construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is only recently that actual property investment, which lagged behind price gains all year, has perked up; through October it was up 4.9% from the same period last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The steady rise in prices had been the underlying rationale for developers to move ahead with construction. But the risk is that a sustained turn in prices will snuff out the impetus to build. There is a clear danger that tighter credit will curb buyers' enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last big real-estate boom, which began in 2012, lasted around a year and a half from trough to peak. With the current recovery already a year old, commodity speculators risk being caught out in the first half of next year if the current cycle proves shallower than the last.</p>

<span class="companylink">ZTO Express Inc</span>. raised $1.4 billion from its New York IPO in October, making it the largest such offering in the U.S. this year. However, shares in the Shanghai-based company fell 15% from their IPO price during their first day of trading, after being priced aggressively at $19.50 a share, exceeding the top end of an expected $16.50 to $18.50 a share range. ZTO shares were up 1.3% at $14.80 on Thursday morning in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Founded in 2007 by Johnny Chou, Google China's former co-president, Best Logistics has grown quickly by building a warehouse and distribution network across China. It operates 400 centers in China as well as three warehouses in the U.S. and one in Germany. It expanded its logistics business to Australia, Japan and Thailand this year. The company also provides domestic and international delivery services for China's online shoppers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alibaba has invested in Best Logistics several times since 2009 and has bought about 22% of its shares for a total of $256 million, according to its 2016 annual report. Cainiao Network invested $165 million for about a 5% stake in Best Logistics this year, the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Best Logistics' other shareholders include Mr. Chou and electronics assembler Foxconn—known formally as <span class="companylink">Hon Hai Precision Industry Co</span>.—among others. <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>.'s private-equity investment arm is also a shareholder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> advised the company on its latest funding round, Best Logistics said in September. Chinese fund-management firms Everbright Asset Management Co. and Citic Private Equity Funds Management Co. led that round.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Candace Taylor </div><div>497 words</div><div>17 November 2016</div><div>10:34</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lakefront Tennessee property where Johnny Cash lived for decades is going on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no longer a house on the roughly 4½-acre Hendersonville property; just a one-bedroom apartment. There is also no asking price. And not just any buyer will be suitable. "In my mind it would be some person [who] is a huge Johnny Cash fan," said the seller, James Gresham. A self-described "huge fan," Mr. Gresham said he won't sell the property unless he feels comfortable with the new owner's plans for it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Located about 20 minutes outside Nashville, the estate on Old Hickory Lake was Johnny and June Carter Cash's home from 1968 until their deaths in 2003, according to their son, John Carter Cash. Their nearly 14,000-square-foot house was destroyed by a fire in 2007[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/musician-john-carter-cash-on-his-one-of-a-kind-childhood-home-1458661945], with only the stone foundation and some walls left standing. A swimming pool, tennis court, garage and guard house escaped the fire, along with a stone walkway that leads down to a covered boat dock, said listing agent Stan Peacock of Crye-Leike Realtors. Mr. Gresham created the apartment in an outbuilding Ms. Cash used for storing costumes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gresham declined to specify an asking price. "There is nothing you can use as a comp," he said. "We're going to see what the market is and go from there." Mr. Peacock said he expects the property to sell for "multimillions," especially given its pedigree.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to public records, Mr. Gresham bought the estate for $2 million in 2014 from Barry Gibb, of the pop group the Bee Gees, and his wife, Linda. The Gibbs were in the process of restoring it when the fire broke out, according to John Carter Cash. The Gibbs, who couldn't be reached for comment, announced plans to rebuild but never did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gresham said when he bought the property he felt it would be the ideal setting for an eating disorder treatment facility. But he said he put the plan on hold after encountering resistance during the approval process. Since then, he said, ill health has caused him to "[pull] back on a lot of my business interests."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Peacock said fans from all over the country still visit the property. "Everybody knows where Johnny Cash's property is," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A renovated Upper East Side townhouse is asking $35 million—quite a markup from its last sale price of $300,000 in 1974.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On 80th Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues, the 19th Century brick townhouse has been owned since 1974 by Joseph Abramoff. Mr. Abramoff, head of a jewelry wholesaler, recently renovated the house extensively, converting it from multiple apartments to a single-family home with seven bedrooms, according to David Kornmeier of Brown Harris Stevens, who has the listing with Deborah Grubman and David Adler of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Abramoff, 70, said in an email that he renovated the house with plans to live there himself, but decided to sell because "it no longer suits my needs." Eight months ago he put the house on the rental market asking $65,000 per month, Mr. Kornmeier said. The house is currently rented, but will be delivered vacant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 20-foot-wide townhouse has roughly 10,000 square feet of space spread over six stories, plus a south-facing garden, a roof deck and three terraces, Mr. Kornmeier said. An elevator goes from the cellar to the roof deck. A guest suite on the cellar and garden levels has its own kitchenette and access to the garden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the high-end real estate market has slowed recently[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/manhattan-apartment-sales-sputter-1467247683], Manhattan townhouses fetch far higher prices than they did decades ago. The average sales price of an East Side townhouse in 2015 was $11 million, up 18.4% from $9.3 million a decade earlier, according to a market report from <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</span>.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Both housing starts and permits for new construction rose in October, a sign residential construction is ramping up to meet steady demand[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/lopsided-housing-rebound-leaves-millions-of-people-out-in-the-cold-1470852996].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But economists questioned whether the construction uptick would be sustained over the longer term[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/a-onetime-housing-skeptic-plans-1-billion-bet-on-homes-1475619217], citing the much smaller increase in permits, as well as an anticipated rise in mortgage rates that could dampen home buyer enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts rose 25.5% in October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.323 million, the Commerce Department said Thursday, as multifamily housing starts came back with a vengeance. That was the highest pace since August 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family starts also continued to climb, reaching a rate of 869,000, another nine-year high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected overall October permits to fall to a 1.20 million annual rate and starts to rise to a 1.15 million pace. Construction typically begins a month or two after a permit is issued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The larger-than-expected gains across all regions "reaffirm our view that steady improvement in the housing market is likely to continue over the next two years," said Rob Martin of <span class="companylink">Barclays Bank PLC</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The volatile category of multifamily housing posted a dramatic rebound, with starts in structures with five or more units, such as condos or apartment buildings, notching a 74.5% gain to hit a rate of 445,000 in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But permits, which give a taste of how much construction is in the pipeline, grew at a milder pace. Building permits issued for privately owned housing units rose 0.3% in October from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.229 million, the highest pace in nearly a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Permits for single-family homes, about 60% of all permits, rose 2.7% to a rate of 762,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Both single and multifamily starts now stand well above the pace implied by permits, and a correction over the next couple of months is inevitable," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monthly housing figures are often choppy and can be subject to large revisions. September permits were unrevised at 1.225 million. September starts were revised up slightly to 1.054 million from 1.047 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">October's permits figure, based on a survey of local governments, had a margin of error of 2.0 percentage points. Last month's starts number, based on a survey of builders and homeowners, came with a margin of error of 12.6 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both permits and starts fell sharply in the years leading up to the recession, as the housing crisis took hold, and remained near all-time low levels for two years after the recession ended. The construction gauges have rebounded since 2011, but the pace of gains slowed over the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through the first 10 months of the year, permits were up just 0.7% compared with the same period in 2015, reflecting a drop in permits for buildings with five or more units that nearly erased gains for single-family permits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starts were up 5.9% through October, again led by gains in the single-family sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Relatively stronger momentum for single-family home construction suggests that builders are responding to rising prices and steady demand for that segment, while construction of larger multifamily projects had been slowing until October's bounce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes, about 90% of the housing market, have grown fairly strongly this year, reaching a postrecession peak in June, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. Steady job growth, wage gains and low interest rates on mortgages have supported home buying. But low inventory of new and existing homes is driving up prices, putting a purchase out of reach of some would-be buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> survey this week showed builder remained confident about the single-family housing market for new homes, as a gauge of home-builder sentiment held steady at 63 in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors group will release data on existing-home sales for October on Tuesday. The Commerce Department's October report on new-home sales will be released on Wednesday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEIJING -- Donald Trump has accused China of driving down the yuan, but Beijing's recent moves to let its currency weaken faster than expected appear to have more to do with the country's worrying property bubble as well as the dollar's broad strength than with sending a message to the U.S. president-elect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Behind the yuan's rapid depreciation lately lurks a bigger concern among Chinese policy makers and economists over the country's own economic situation, according to officials and analysts: Regardless of who is in the White House, the government may have to accept a much weaker yuan because of asset bubbles -- especially in China's property market -- and continued reliance on stimulus to prop up growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That heightens the risk of a yuan feedback loop that likely would be driven less by outside forces, the people say. The recent rapid run-up in property prices in many cities, for instance, is sending more Chinese looking to foreign markets to park their money, potentially exacerbating capital outflows that drive down the yuan further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For the foreseeable future, asset bubbles and uncertainty over China's growth likely will be the main factor playing into renminbi's depreciation expectations," said an economic adviser to the Chinese leadership, using another name for the yuan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, after the dollar strengthened overnight, <span class="companylink">China's central bank</span>, which controls the yuan's trading in the mainland market, set the currency's official rate, or "fix," at 6.8592 per dollar -- its weakest level in more than eight years. That brought the yuan's loss against the dollar to nearly 1.4% in the week since Mr. Trump won the White House.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, investors have largely taken the yuan's slump in stride, as it is in keeping with the dollar-driven exchange-rate mechanism that the central bank put in place early this year. Investors are also aware that Beijing has the tools to prevent a free fall in the yuan. But some Chinese officials and investors are questioning whether the central bank is prepared for a sustained dollar rally under the Trump administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The skeptics compare the yuan's most recent tumbling to its drop following the U.K.'s unexpected vote to leave the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> five months ago, which also threw currency markets into turmoil and sent the dollar soaring.Then, the <span class="companylink">People's Bank of China</span> quickly said it had put contingency plans in place and would keep the yuan stable. This time, the central bank hasn't made any public statements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent days, the <span class="companylink">PBOC</span> hasn't conducted any large-scale intervention intended to support the yuan, according to currency traders. The relative hands-off approach, China experts say, underscores Chinese officials' overall wait-and-see attitude toward Mr. Trump and which campaign pledges he will take action on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">PBOC</span> declined to comment on the yuan's moves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In anticipation of higher interest rates in the U.S. and a continued dollar rally, a number of investment banks including <span class="companylink">UBS Group AG</span>, <span class="companylink">HSBC Holdings PLC</span> and <span class="companylink">Standard Chartered PLC</span> have in recent days lowered their year-end projections for the yuan to around 6.90 per dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While China's highly controlled exchange-rate regime may have saved the yuan from a dive like the Mexican peso, we believe the pressure will still manifest itself" through the potential for growing trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, said Harrison Hu, chief China economist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group in Singapore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some officials close to the country's economic mandarins are hoping that Mr. Trump will be pragmatic in his dealings with Beijing as both countries stand to lose from trade or currency conflicts. Meanwhile, executives at some big Chinese companies that sell to the U.S. markets are trying to put together a Plan B in the event of a much tougher U.S. stance on trade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese outflows continue: Its foreign-exchange reserves plunged $45.7 billion in October from the previous month to $3.12 trillion. The stockpile of foreign currencies was eroded by more than half-a-trillion dollars last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beijing in recent months has sought to limit bubbles in China's bond and property markets and the central bank has refrained from aggressive monetary easing while trying to ensure liquidity in the financial system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the government also is treading carefully not to cause a sharp drop in home prices because home sales have supported a slowing economy as other growth engines such as manufacturing and business investment remain lackluster. Authorities may need to keep interest rates low for a while to support housing prices and China's overall growth, said Zhu Chaoping, China economist at <span class="companylink">UOB Kay Hian Holdings Ltd</span>., a Singapore-based investment bank. That would translate into more room for the yuan to depreciate, he said. Lower interest rates tend to put downward pressure on a country's currency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central bank has previously dismissed suggestions that it is sacrificing the yuan's exchange rate to support the property market. It said in its third-quarter monetary-policy report released last week that would be "too big of a price" to pay, resulting in "structural distortions" and "accumulation of debt."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, if authorities keep printing money to bolster growth, economists warn, that ultimately would lead to a sharply weaker yuan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If money supply can't be effectively controlled, then the path of depreciation would be a long one," said Li Xunlei, chief economist at Haitong Securities, a large firm in China.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOREIGN POLICY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quayle Says Security</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To Be Trump Priority</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President-elect Donald Trump will promote security rather than liberty and democracy in his foreign policy as autocratic regimes become more numerous across the world, according to former U.S. Vice President Dan Quayle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've had this huge debate in foreign policy over the years on whether the priority should be liberty or stability, and liberty meaning human rights, democracy," Mr. Quayle said at a conference in Amsterdam on Wednesday. "I do see Trump having much more of a security-stability viewpoint in foreign policy rather than liberty-democracy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Quayle was vice president from 1989 to 1993 under President George H.W. Bush, including during the first Gulf War. He said he has spoken to Mr. Trump since his surprise election victory on Nov. 8. Mr. Quayle said that he believes Mr. Trump will favor working with leaders of authoritarian governments, including Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He seems to like the tough people. He likes to deal with people who have authority and that can bring stability, like Gen. Sisi of Egypt," Mr. Quayle said. "Everyone talks about this rising nationalism. Authoritarian regimes have been emboldened in the last five or six years, very much so, around the world."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Upbeat About Market</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. builders are confident about the market for single-family homes, reflecting steady sales and a stable economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>, a trade group, said Wednesday its housing-market index stood at 63 in November, unchanged from October. Numbers above 50 indicate more builders view conditions as good than poor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reading matched the expectation of economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal and is only slightly below September's decade-high index of 65.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists track sentiment among home builders to gauge whether a pickup in construction is imminent. Builders are more likely to begin projects -- and in turn create jobs and kick-start economic growth -- if they have an optimistic outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's report showed a measure of builders' views about the present market held steady at 69 in November. An index of their outlook for the market over the next six months fell two points to 69. A third component measuring traffic of prospective buyers climbed a point to 47.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 53,000 more people selected plans during the first 12 days of open enrollment than during the comparable period last year, officials with the <span class="companylink">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</span> said on Wednesday.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TJX's chief financial officer is Scott Goldenberg; its CEO is Ernie Herrman. An earlier version of this article misspelled Mr. Goldenberg's name and misspelled Mr. Herrman's name on one reference. (Nov. 16)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American consumers shrugged off pre-election jitters this fall and spent more on home-improvement projects, sporting goods and off-price clothing, a promising sign ahead of the Black Friday retail frenzy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that the election is over and airwaves are freed up to advertise more, retailers are in a race to log as many sales as possible before Christmas, a stretch that can make or break a retailer's financials for the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">TJX</span>, which owns <span class="companylink">T.J. Maxx</span> and other discount chains, said it is already stepping up marketing. "Our TV commercials have just launched and will be running every week throughout the holiday season," said Chief Executive Ernie Herrman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Home Depot Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Dick's Sporting Goods Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">TJX</span> on Tuesday all reported strong sales growth in the quarter through October, with gains of at least 5% at existing stores from the year before. The results came on the same day the Commerce Department reported the best two-month performance of national retail sales in at least two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data suggest a healthy profile for the U.S. consumer ahead of the all-important holiday shopping season. <span class="companylink">The National Retail Federation</span> estimates sales over the period will rise 3.6% from a year ago, slightly higher than the 3.4% growth last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The earnings reports Tuesday from three large chains show the continuation of outside factors have buoyed their results. However, shares of all three companies fell in Tuesday trading, after rallying in the wake of the election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later this week, investors will get another measure of spending when <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart Stores Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Target Corp</span>. report their latest results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some retailers thrive with tailwinds like a rising housing market or a competitor's bankruptcy, pockets of weakness remain. Department stores Macy's Inc., <span class="companylink">Kohl's Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">J.C. Penney Co</span>. posted sales declines in their recent quarters and some big-box retailers such as Target are struggling to attract shoppers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Online shopping also is proving to be a major competition, siphoning off shopping trips to physical stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid concerns that the final weeks of the presidential election had weighed on sales, finance chief Carol Tome said "that didn't happen at the <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>." One reason is that much of <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>'s business are purchases that shoppers can't forego. "If your refrigerator stops working, you're going to replace it no matter who is elected to office," Ms. Tome said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the quarter, <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>'s sales rose 5.5% at existing stores, including 5.9% in the U.S. The rise in housing prices has made homeowners more willing to spend on projects like bathroom remodels and roof replacements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earnings rose 14% to nearly $2 billion, helped by a rising value of each transaction. k</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">TJX</span>, which also owns Marshalls and <span class="companylink">HomeGoods</span>, relayed a similarly optimistic message saying more shoppers came to its stores to hunt through its off-price goods driving up its sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our traffic, sales and merchandise margin increases tell us our strategies are working," said Scott Goldenberg, TJX's chief financial officer. The margin increase, however, was offset by rising wages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The retailer, which opened 110 new stores in the period, reported a 6.3% drop in net income to $549.8 million as financial charges on debt and pensions eroded its 6.9% rise in total sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, sports retailer Dick's said sales rose 5.2% at existing stores, as it picked up market share in the wake of the bankruptcy of rivals, including <span class="companylink">Sports Authority</span> and Golfsmith. "Looking ahead onto the fourth quarter, we are confident our assortment and marketing will help us to continue to capture displaced market share this holiday," Chief Executive Edward Stack said, though he raised concerns that warmer weather could depress sales of high-margin cold-weather gear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">TJX</span>, which also owns Marshalls and <span class="companylink">HomeGoods</span>, said tighter inventory in the industry hadn't hurt its ability to scoop up excess merchandise to sell at its discount chains. "The market is loaded with goods," CEO Mr. Herrman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stack played down concerns that the election had kept shoppers on the sidelines. "We don't really think it had any impact," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists track sentiment among home builders to gauge whether a pickup in construction is imminent. Builders are more likely to begin projects—and in turn create jobs and kick-start economic growth—if they have an optimistic outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Ongoing job creation, rising incomes and attractive mortgage rates are supporting demand in the single-family housing sector," Robert Dietz, the home builder trade group's chief economist, said in a statement. "This will help keep housing on a steady, upward glide path in the months ahead."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's report showed a measure of builders' views about the present market held steady at 69 in November. An index of their outlook for the market over the next six months fell two points to 69. A third component measuring traffic of prospective buyers climbed a point to 47.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While home construction has been rising for years, it remains soft historically. Builders have pointed to a shortage of available land in high-demand areas as one factor restraining construction. Weak residential investment has weighed on the U.S. economy in the last two quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That may change. Permits for new construction and starts on single-family homes rose solidly in September, the Commerce Department said in a report last month. Housing starts figures for October will be released Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, rising home sales coupled with declining inventory are boosting prices, creating a divide in the market. While many middle- and upper-income buyers are still in a position to buy, lower-income and potential first-time buyers are being pinched.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of newly built single-family homes, which account for only about 10% of the housing market, rose in September after falling in August, the Commerce Department said in an earlier report. Sales of previously owned homes, which account for the bulk of the market, rose in September, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. Realtors fear high prices are stymieing home buying, and are looking to builders to refresh the nation's supply of available housing stock.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American consumers shrugged off pre-election jitters this fall and spent more on home-improvement projects, sporting goods and off-price clothing, a promising sign ahead of the Black Friday retail frenzy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that the election is over and airwaves are freed up to advertise more, retailers are in a race to log as many sales as possible before Christmas, a stretch that can make or break a retailer's financials for the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">TJX</span>, which owns <span class="companylink">T.J. Maxx</span> and other discount chains, said it is already stepping up marketing. "Our TV commercials have just launched and will be running every week throughout the holiday season," said Chief Executive Ernie Herrman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Home Depot Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Dicks Sporting Goods Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">TJX</span> on Tuesday all reported strong sales growth in the quarter through October, with gains of at least 5% at existing stores from the year before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results came on the same day the Commerce Department reported the best two-month performance of national retail sales in at least two years. The data suggest a healthy profile for the consumer ahead of the holidays. <span class="companylink">The National Retail Federation</span> estimates sales over the period will rise 3.6% from a year ago, slightly higher than the 3.4% growth last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The earnings reports Tuesday from three large chains show the continuation of outside factors have buoyed their results. However, shares of all three companies fell in Tuesday trading, after rallying in the wake of the election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later this week, investors will get another measure of spending when <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart Stores Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Target Corp</span>. report their latest results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some retailers thrive with tailwinds like a rising housing market or a competitor's bankruptcy, pockets of weakness remain. Department stores Macy's Inc., <span class="companylink">Kohl's Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">J.C. Penney Co</span>. posted sales declines in their recent quarters and some big-box retailers such as Target are struggling to attract shoppers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Online shopping also is proving to be a major competition, siphoning off shopping trips to physical stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid concerns that the final weeks of the presidential election had weighed on sales, finance chief Carol Tome said "that didn't happen at the <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the quarter, <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> reported sales rose 5.5% at existing stores, including 5.9% in the U.S. The rise in housing prices has made homeowners more willing to spend on projects like bathroom remodels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earnings rose 14% to nearly $2 billion, helped by a rising value of each transaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">TJX</span> relayed a similarly optimistic message saying more shoppers came to its stores to hunt through its off-price goods. The retailer, which opened 110 new stores in the period, reported a 6.3% drop in net income to $549.8 million as financial charges on debt and pensions eroded its 6.9% rise in total sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, sports retailer Dick's said sales rose 5.2% at existing stores, as it picked up market share in the wake of the bankruptcy of <span class="companylink">Sports Authority</span> and Golfsmith.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Defaults are rising in a key corner of the commercial-real-estate debt market just as borrowing costs are set to jump, raising the likelihood of a slowdown of the $11 trillion U.S. commercial-property sector in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A financial-crisis-era regulation is about to take effect that is expected to make some commercial-real-estate borrowing more expensive and complicated, analysts said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, interest rates have increased since the election of Donald Trump as the nation's 45th president last week and seem poised for a sustained rise from recent historic lows, which would further squeeze an industry built on borrowed money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I can paint a picture that it could be disastrous, with runaway inflation and high interest rates," Charlie Bendit, co-chief executive of Taconic Investment Partners LLC, said at a New York industry luncheon last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The worries raise fresh concerns for the commercial-property market as it enters its eighth year of expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, landlords are battling a slowdown in sales and rising vacancy rates of multifamily housing units across the U.S. and of office space in Houston, Washington and other big markets. Commercial property sales volume was down 8.6% in the first nine months of 2016 to $345.4 billion, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now defaults are on the rise as well. More than 5.6% of some $390 billion worth of commercial-property mortgages that have been packaged into securities was more than 60 days late in payment in September, according to <span class="companylink">Moody's Investors Service</span>. That was up from a 4.6% delinquency rate earlier this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The culprit: loose lending before the financial crisis. Ten-year loans issued in 2006 and 2007 are coming due now, and many borrowers aren't able to pay them off despite rising property values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, <span class="companylink">Morningstar Credit Ratings LLC</span> predicts borrowers won't be able to pay off roughly 40% of the commercial-mortgage-backed securities loans coming due next year. Suburban office properties and shopping centers are being hit particularly hard, said Edward Dittmer, a Morningstar vice president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're seeing a lot of stress," Mr. Dittmer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider the Skyline office complex in Fairfax, Va. Vornado Realty Trust financed the property in 2007 with a $678 million mortgage that was converted into bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vornado was forced to restructure the loan in 2012 after the portfolio ran into trouble. Earlier this year, Vornado for a second time notified the loan servicer that "cash flow will be insufficient to service the debt," according to a regulatory filing. A Vornado spokesman declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, a venture including New York investor Jacob Chetrit that owns a 1.2 million-square-foot office property on Seventh Avenue in Manhattan is negotiating an extension of a $136.9 million loan made in 2006. The space is about 15% vacant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Victor Gerstein, a lawyer working for the venture, stressed that it is current in its monthly debt service and that there hasn't been a default. The owners are moving to increase the building's occupancy and "will be very well positioned to get a very attractive loan in the near future," Mr. Gerstein said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding to the market's worries are new rules that go into effect on Christmas Eve under the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul requiring issuers of commercial-mortgage-backed securities to keep at least 5% of the securities they create.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The so-called risk-retention rules likely will make borrowing more costly and complicated, raising the chances that some property owners won't be able to refinance loans from the boom years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You couldn't have planned worse timing," said Tad Philipp, director of commercial real-estate research at Moody's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trump promised during his campaign to repeal Dodd-Frank, but analysts said that could take a long time and that certain provisions might remain on the books, including risk retention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, banks, insurance companies and other finance firms have picked up some of the slack from the shrinking commercial-mortgage-securities business. More than half of the bonds issued in 2005 and 2006 for New York properties were refinanced by such lenders, according to a report earlier this year by CrediFi, a real-estate data and analysis firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are other problems flaring up as well. Regulators earlier this year warned that vacancy has been growing in the rental apartment market, and that higher interest rates in the next two years could damp price growth there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're flashing a yellow light over the market," said Ely Razin, CEO of CrediFi.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Judy McKinnon </div><div>302 words</div><div>15 November 2016</div><div>10:13</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes in Canada rose 2.4% in October from September[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/canadian-home-sales-rise-in-september-1476458877], the <span class="companylink">Canadian Real Estate Association</span> said Tuesday, marking the first reading for the agency since the latest policy measures aimed at cooling housing markets in the country's biggest cities came into effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The industry group, which represents Canadian realtors, said activity increased in about 60% of all local markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Early evidence suggests that the influence of tighter mortgage regulations on sales activity has been mixed," the agency's president, Cliff Iverson, said in a release.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He cautioned, however, that more time is needed before fully assessing the effects of the new policies on housing markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The federal government will no doubt want to monitor the effect of new mortgage regulations on the many varied housing markets across Canada and on the economy, particularly given the recent rise in uncertainty about economic growth prospects following the U.S. presidential election," Mr. Iverson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Among the new measures adopted[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/canada-takes-new-measures-to-cool-housing-markets-1475514969] was a requirement that all insured mortgages undergo a "stress test" to ensure new homeowners can afford their mortgages, which came into effect in the middle of October. Before that, frothy conditions prompted the province of British Columbia to impose a 15% surtax [http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/vancouver-unveils-new-tax-for-foreign-home-buyers-1469478909/]on foreign-led housing purchases in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency said the national average price for homes sold last month was up 5.9% from a year earlier, to 481,994 Canadian dollars ($355,700). Prices continue to be fueled by activity in the country's hottest markets of Vancouver and Toronto, it noted. Excluding the two markets, the average price was closer to C$361,000.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Heather Gillers   </div><div>744 words</div><div>14 November 2016</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President-elect Donald Trump is promising an infrastructure boom once he is sworn in. In some parts of the country, a burst of new construction spending by states and cities is already under way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">State and local governments around the U.S. have issued $149 billion in bonds for new infrastructure projects so far this year, putting 2016 municipal borrowing on track to surpass each of the past five years, according to <span class="companylink">Thomson Reuters</span> data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the new bond issuance happened in the second and third quarters, after a long stretch of low borrowing. Total bond issuance, including refinancing, has reached $388 billion, also a five-year record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, voters across the country authorized state and local governments to borrow an additional $55.7 billion for similar projects, according to Ipreo. It was by far the most borrowing approved since 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think there's a lot of momentum, not only at the political level but also by the general public, to start spending more on infrastructure," said Dan Heckman, senior fixed-income strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trump made a $1 trillion infrastructure investment over the next decade one of his first priorities as president, promising in his victory speech Wednesday to "rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals." The proposal relies on private financing. Experts and industry officials say it is unlikely the nation's aging infrastructure can be updated without public support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the short term, however, costs could go up for government borrowers. Municipal-bond prices have dropped along with Treasurys in days after the election, with interest rates for an A-rated 20-year general-obligation bond at 3.2%on Thursday, compared with 2.94% on Monday, according to <span class="companylink">Thomson Reuters</span>. Analysts cited concerns that inflation under a Trump administration could increase borrowing costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In an era where the range has been pretty tight, that's a pretty dramatic move in such a short period of time, and he hasn't even taken office yet," said Howard Cure, director of municipal research at Evercore Wealth Management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Florida Bond Finance Director Ben Watkins is relieved to have refinanced more than $1 billion in mostly state general obligation bonds since June. His only regret, he said, is that he didn't also push through a planned $250 million bond to improve Florida's turnpike and another deal to refinance school-construction borrowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With this change in [municipal bond] rates, I wish I had been smart enough to go ahead and sell regardless of what the market felt like," Mr. Watkins said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local infrastructure projects have languished for years as cities and states struggled to balance their budgets after the recession. Long-term borrowing for new projects by major U.S. cities hit a 24-year low in 2014, according to an analysis by <span class="companylink">Pew Charitable Trusts</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With expectations of a federal rate increase in December, local officials were eager to get in on historically low interest rates, many analysts said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Municipalities issued $108 billion in bonds in the third quarter, compared with $86 billion in the third quarter of 2015, according to <span class="companylink">Thomson Reuters</span> data. They also asked voters Tuesday to approve nearly 700 ballot measures seeking to issue bonds and won approval for more than 70% of them, according to Ipreo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The low interest rates are very attractive to us and the idea of waiting any longer means the cost will drive up," said Alicia Trost, spokeswoman for San Francisco's <span class="companylink">Bay Area Rapid Transit</span>. The transportation system won voters' approval Tuesday to issue $3.5 billion in bonds, its first referendum since 2004. The money will be used to replace 90 miles of rail and fix leaky tunnels and other infrastructure improvements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Voters in Texas' El Paso Independent School District approved $668.7 million in new borrowing in what was the school system's first successful bond referendum since 2007, said spokeswoman Melissa Martinez. The money will pay for a consolidation of school campuses to accommodate declining enrollment, 81 new school buses and laptops for middle-school students in the 60,000-student district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A citizens committee working on the referendum chose not to limit the borrowing to $500 million after learning that the additional money would add only $2.39 to the tax bill for a $100,000 home.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Burke said voters last week passed $200 billion in infrastructure projects being tracked by the Los Angeles-based company that are expected to spur rapid growth in 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President-elect Donald Trump's election-night focus on boosting spending on domestic infrastructure drove a rally in construction-related stocks[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/donald-trumps-plans-fire-up-builders-1478720481] last week that continued Monday, despite uncertainty over the incoming administration's specific funding plans and priorities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Burke said expected changes in energy policy were expected to reverse some of the weakness in segments such as pipelines, but state-funded projects already provided reason for optimism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't think we've ever been more bullish on the future of infrastructure in North America," Mr. Burke said on a call after Aecom reported quarterly profits that undershot analysts' expectations alongside guidance for next year that also fell short.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">State and local spending typically accounts for 75% of the public sector share of domestic infrastructure investment in projects such as roads and water treatment facilities, with the federal budget paying for the balance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trump had pledged on the campaign trail to invest $1 trillion over 10 years on a variety of infrastructure projects [https://www.greatagain.gov/policy/transportation-infrastructure.html]if elected, and analysts said his win could ease the passage next year of an infrastructure spending bill already being considered by Congress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plans hinge on unlocking more private sector spending that is dependent on establishing revenue streams such as road and bridge tolls to pay down debt as well as securing regulatory approvals and public sector contributions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aecom shares climbed after Mr. Burke's remarks, having nursed an early loss following the 2017 guidance. Shares were up more than 6.4% at $34.29 in Monday afternoon trading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company forecast adjusted profit in 2017 in a range of $2.70 to $3.10 a share, compared with the consensus estimate from analysts of $3.24 a share, according to FactSet. Fourth-quarter profits rose to $7.2 million, or a nickel a share, up from $1.1 million, or a penny a share. Revenue fell to 8% to $4.3 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Burke said Aecom's $6.3 billion in contract wins for the quarter, including work on the new stadium for the <span class="companylink">Los Angeles Rams</span> football team, were a record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company's results in its year ended in September were hurt by "uneven client spending" in Aecom's Americas business, Mr. Burke said, as well as pressures from low oil and gasoline prices. Mr. Burke also blamed underwhelming performance on less-than-expected earnings contributions from sizable power and industrial construction wins in the second half of the year, because of timing.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Heather Gillers </div><div>802 words</div><div>12 November 2016</div><div>07:00</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President-elect Donald Trump is promising an infrastructure boom once he is sworn in. In some parts of the country, a burst of new construction spending by states and cities is already under way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">State and local governments around the U.S. have issued $149 billion in bonds for new infrastructure projects thus far this year, putting 2016 municipal borrowing on track to surpass each of the past five years, according to <span class="companylink">Thomson Reuters</span> data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the new bond issuance happened in the second and third quarters, after a long stretch of low borrowing. Total bond issuance, including refinancing, has reached $388 billion, also a five-year record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, voters across the country authorized state and local governments to borrow another $55.7 billion for similar projects, according to Ipreo. It was by far the most borrowing approved since 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think there's a lot of momentum, not only at the political level but also by the general public, to start spending more on infrastructure," said Dan Heckman, senior fixed-income strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trump made a $1 trillion infrastructure investment over the next decade one of his first priorities as president, promising in his victory speech Wednesday [http://blogs.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/washwire/2016/11/09/donald-trumps-victory-speech-video-and-full-text/] to "rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals." The proposal relies on private financing. Experts and industry officials say it is unlikely the nation's aging infrastructure can be updated without public support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the short term, however, costs could go up for government borrowers. Municipal-bond prices have dropped along with Treasurys in days after the election, with interest rates for an A-rated 20-year general obligation bond at 3.2% on Thursday, compared with 2.94% on Monday, according to <span class="companylink">Thomson Reuters</span>. Analysts cited concerns that inflation under a Trump administration could increase borrowing costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In an era where the range has been pretty tight, that's a pretty dramatic move in such a short period of time and he hasn't even taken office yet," said Howard Cure, director of municipal research at Evercore Wealth Management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Florida bond finance director Ben Watkins is relieved to have refinanced more than $1 billion in mostly state general obligation bonds since June. His only regret, he said, is that he didn't also push through a planned $250 million bond to improve Florida's turnpike and another deal to refinance school construction borrowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With this change in [municipal bond] rates, I wish I had been smart enough to go ahead and sell regardless of what the market felt like," Mr. Watkins said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local infrastructure projects have languished for years as cities and states struggled to balance their budgets in the aftermath of the recession. Long-term borrowing for new projects by major U.S. cities hit a 24-year low in 2014, according to an analysis by <span class="companylink">The Pew Charitable Trusts</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with expectations of a federal rate increase in December [http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/fed-sends-new-signals-about-a-possible-december-rate-increase-1478109738], local officials were eager to get in on historically low interest rates, many analysts said. Municipalities issued $108 billion in bonds in the third quarter of this year, compared with $86 billion in the third quarter of 2015, according to <span class="companylink">Thomson Reuters</span> data. They also asked voters Tuesday to approve nearly 700 ballot measures seeking to issue bonds and won approval for more than 70% of them, according to Ipreo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The low interest rates are very attractive to us and the idea of waiting any longer means the cost will drive up," said Alicia Trost, spokeswoman for San Francisco's <span class="companylink">Bay Area Rapid Transit</span>, or BART. The transportation system won voters' approval Tuesday to issue $3.5 billion in bonds, its first referendum since 2004. The money will be used to replace 90 miles of rail and fix leaky tunnels and other infrastructure improvements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Voters in Texas' El Paso Independent School District approved $668.7 million in new borrowing in what was the school system's first successful bond referendum since 2007, said spokeswoman Melissa Martinez. The money will pay for a consolidation of school campuses to accommodate declining enrollment, 81 new school buses and laptops for middle-school students in the 60,000-student district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A citizens committee working on the referendum chose not to limit the borrowing to $500 million after learning that the additional money would add only $2.39 to the tax bill for a $100,000 home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That type of deal will likely still be available to them. Despite the postelection volatility, "borrowing costs are still relatively and historically low," U.S. Bank's Mr. Heckman said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HONG KONG—Hong Kong property stocks slumped Monday after a decision by the city's government late last week to increase property taxes in an effort to cool a surging market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new measures, which will see the stamp duty on home purchases [http://blogs.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/moneybeat/2016/11/06/hong-kong-property-tax-just-redirects-easy-money/]by an individual or corporation almost double to 15% from 8.5%, are meant to tamp down prices that have risen nearly 9% this year, the government said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hong Kong developers led the top decliners in morning trading, with <span class="companylink">New World Development Co</span>., <span class="companylink">Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd</span>. and <span class="companylink">Wheelock &amp; Co</span>. each diving more than 9%. <span class="companylink">Henderson Land Development Co</span>., <span class="companylink">Sino Land Co</span>., <span class="companylink">Kerry Properties Ltd</span>. and <span class="companylink">Sino Land Co</span>. were all down more than 6%. The broader Hang Seng Index was up 0.5% by the middle of the day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hong Kong property prices, already among the world's most expensive, have headed upward this year thanks to low mortgage rates and rising interest from mainland Chinese buyers eager to park their money in non-yuan denominated assets. The Chinese currency has dropped 4.35% against the dollar this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying said Friday that investment demand in the housing market had risen in the past few months and the cooling measures were in part aimed to counter this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts at <span class="companylink">Bank of America Merrill Lynch</span> on Monday downgraded their outlook for Hong Kong developers saying "the higher stamp duty will likely impact about 25% of transactions and drive out investors and some mainlanders (at least in the short term)." BAML now forecasts a 5% drop in Hong Kong property prices in the next six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High property prices have long been a flashpoint in Hong Kong, a city of seven million that is part of China but has its own legal and government system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time home buyers who are also Hong Kong residents will be exempt from the new tax rate, the government said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts expect the new tax measures to fuel reluctance on the part of both buyers and sellers in the housing market, suppressing volume and reducing liquidity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For equity market investors, this should be a trigger for profit-taking since property stocks have rallied over the past few months on the back of strong sales, said Jonas Kan, head of Hong Kong research at Daiwa Capital Markets.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Eva Dou </div><div>547 words</div><div>5 November 2016</div><div>07:00</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEIJING—<span class="companylink">Foxconn Technology</span> Group will soon release its first quarterly results since its acquisition of <span class="companylink">Sharp Corp</span>., with the embattled Japanese company's losses expected to drag down earnings despite the new iPhone 7's boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The earnings of the Taiwanese contract gadget maker—known formally as <span class="companylink">Hon Hai Precision Industry Co</span>.—are closely watched in the hardware industry as a leading indicator for <span class="companylink">Apple Inc</span>., its largest client. Apple projected last month it would return to growth in the current quarter due to strong sales of the iPhone 7, which Foxconn began producing months before the device's September launch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Foxconn's third-quarter results, due out in the coming week, are expected to be weighed by losses at Sharp, which it acquired halfway through the quarter. Sharp reported a net loss of ¥17.9 billion ($170.8 million) for the July-September quarter. A portion of that loss will be reflected in Foxconn's result. Foxconn is the world's biggest smartphone assembler by shipments and revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts are expecting a modest profit decline for Foxconn: the average net profit estimate of nine analysts polled by Capital IQ was 33.3 billion New Taiwan dollars ($1.1 billion), down from NT$37.9 billion a year earlier. Due to the practice of monthly revenue disclosure in Taiwan, Foxconn has already announced its revenue for the quarter: NT$1.074 trillion, up from NT$1.066 trillion a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sharp, which remains listed on the <span class="companylink">Tokyo Stock Exchange</span>, said Tuesday that it expects to return to profitability by the second half of its fiscal year, which ends March 31. Foxconn is under pressure to stem Sharp's losses quickly: The Taiwanese company has built a reputation with investors as a stable, efficient company that increases profits year to year, in times both fat and lean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foxconn, which trades on the <span class="companylink">Taiwan Stock Exchange</span>, will likely report its earnings late in the week. The famously secretive company doesn't publicize its earnings release dates, hold investor conferences, or give sales projections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foxconn completed its $3.8 billion acquisition of Sharp in August, after years of tumultuous negotiations and last-minute hitches that almost derailed the deal. Sharp's advanced flat-screen panel business fits into Foxconn's strategy to expand into high-end components—a more lucrative business than electronics assembly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foxconn has said it would help Sharp speed its efforts to mass-produce organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, displays, a technology that holds promise for next-generation gadgets with flexible screens. Apple is considering adopting this technology for iPhones as early as next year, The Wall Street Journal has reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Sharp's new chief executive, Tai Jeng-wu, said Tuesday he hasn't yet decided if his company will fully commit to OLED or stick with more widely used liquid-crystal displays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While manufacturing devices for Apple is still Foxconn's largest source of revenue, the Taipei-based company has increasingly diversified into other high-tech fields ranging from telecom infrastructure, to robotics and e-commerce.</p>

Hostess Brands, Purveyor of Twinkies and Ho-Hos, Returning to Wall Street; Snack maker completes complex transaction with investment vehicle Gores</span>
</div><div class="author">By Annie Gasparro and Corrie Driebusch </div><div>818 words</div><div>4 November 2016</div><div>18:49</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Hostess Brands Inc</span>. is expected to start trading as a public company on Monday, putting the snack business to its first broad test of investor appetite since it was bought out of liquidation[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/SB10001424127887324260204578584060534891582] almost four years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 86-year-old brand behind the famous Twinkies cakes is due to list on the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq Stock Market</span> with the ticker symbol TWNK.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hostess comes to the market at a time when healthier snacks like kale, quinoa and gluten-free cookies are gaining popularity. But some investors say iconic, indulgent brands like Twinkies, Ho-Hos and Ding Dongs retain a special place in American culture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The snack company is going public via a so-called publicly traded special-purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, an increasingly popular way for companies to go public. The arrangement is complex, but avoids the risk of an initial public offering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The acquisition company for Hostess is <span class="companylink">Gores Holdings Inc</span>., created more than a year ago to buy a yet-to-be determined company. In July, Gores said it was planning to buy Hostess[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/hostess-to-go-public-after-purchase-by-acquisition-company-1467720119] in a deal that valued the company at $2.3 billion. And on Thursday, its shareholders agreed to go through with the transaction under which Hostess's private-equity owners—Dean Metropoulos and <span class="companylink">Apollo Global Management LLC</span>–retain a big stake and as well management roles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Alec Gores, founder and chief executive of the <span class="companylink">Gores Group</span>, said he and other investors were initially concerned that Hostess didn't fit into the current healthy-eating trend, but he believes it has growth potential.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's an iconic brand, part of Americana," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hostess said it generated $620.8 million in revenue and $88.8 million in profit last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some funds are restricted from owning shares of SPACs, so their first chance to own a piece of the company will be Monday, which could lead to a pop in the stock. However, shares of <span class="companylink">Gores Holdings</span> are already trading up roughly 30% from before its July announcement of its merger with Hostess, limiting the potential upside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doug Butler, director of research at Rockland Trust, which manages nearly $3 billion and owns Hostess competitor <span class="companylink">Flowers Foods Inc</span>., added that the bakery industry in general was "not looking that strong."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trading as a public company marks a big turnaround from November 2012, when Hostess shut down[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/SB10001424127887324556304578122632560842670] its factories following a nationwide strike by members of its bakers union over a court-imposed labor contract that cut wages and other benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four months later, Mr. Metropoulos—known for turning around ailing brands such as Bumble Bee tuna and Chef Boyardee—teamed up with <span class="companylink">Apollo Global</span> to buy the Hostess snack-cake brands and four factories out of liquidation for $685 million in cash and loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By July 2013, they were shipping products to stores again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new Hostess emerged without the pension costs, union contracts and $1.3 billion worth of debt that burdened the business in its former life. It proceeded to reduce manufacturing and distribution costs by doubling the shelf life of its snack cakes to 65 days, automating production and switching to a central distribution system that uses third-party drivers and warehouses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the stock market transaction, Gores put up $375 million in equity, while other investors, including Apollo and Mr. Metropolous, kicked in $350 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Metropoulos, his sons Daren and Evan, who are principals at his firm, and Apollo and its affiliates will remain the company's largest shareholder with a 42% combined stake. They are set to make 10 times their initial $185 million cash investment in Hostess, people familiar with the matter have said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hostess Chief Executive Bill Toler, whose favorite Hostess snack is the Ho-Ho, said things were chaotic at first. "It took us the better part of a year to get orders right," he said. "I took a lot of arrows in the first six months I was in the job."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Hostess is focusing on new products, like peanut butter Ho-Hos, which are coming out soon, and the recently launched deep fried Twinkies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company says it will never shy away from its indulgent nature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a balance," said Mark Stone, chief of the investment vehicle <span class="companylink">Gores Holdings</span>, who spent the summer meeting with fund managers hoping they would invest. "A kale salad for lunch, and at 3 p.m., a Ho-Ho for a snack."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the New Haven housing development in Ontario, Calif., Brookfield Residential is building 189 townhomes priced below $378,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the moderately priced homes have sold at nearly twice the rate of others listed above the $378,000 mark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That isn't an arbitrary price. It marks the upper limit for a buyer to qualify for a low-down-payment, federally insured mortgage in Southern California's Inland Empire, the suburban expanse east of Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such mortgages, known as <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span> loans, have become a primary vehicle for first-time buyers and those rebounding from the housing crash who have less-than-stellar credit and lack the 10% to 20% down payment required for most conventional mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders and developers in many higher-cost housing markets still recovering from the bust -- including the Inland Empire, Las Vegas, Sacramento, Calif., and Phoenix -- say the price limits set by the federal government make it nearly impossible to deliver homes for buyers looking to purchase with <span class="companylink">FHA</span> loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's basically put a lid on the market," said Michael Maples, co-founder of Trumark Cos., a California builder and developer. "For builders, if you're above that <span class="companylink">FHA</span> limit your buyer pool is significantly lower."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">FHA</span>, overseen by the <span class="companylink">U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, doesn't make loans directly but insures third-party lenders against default and charges insurance premiums to borrowers, who can make lower down payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the hallmarks of the housing recovery has been the historically low level of new-home construction, particularly at lower price points attainable for first-time buyers. Although a wide range of factors are at play, from slow wage growth to higher regulatory costs, builders say the <span class="companylink">FHA</span> limits in many markets are shutting out potential buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The challenge is particularly acute in California, which has the nation's highest upfront fees for new construction, according to housing-research firm <span class="companylink">Zelman &amp; Associates</span>. Fees to pay for roads, sewers, schools and other infrastructure in California markets average between $40,000 and $72,000 per home, according to the firm's research, compared with an average of $2,600 in Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With all the fees they've been asked to pay, it's almost impossible for them to make money" on entry-level homes, said Ivy Zelman, chief executive of <span class="companylink">Zelman &amp; Associates</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span> sets the limits for <span class="companylink">FHA</span> loans through a formula that draws on median home prices in a metro area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a 2008 crisis-era law expired at the end of 2013, HUD changed its formula to reflect home values after the crisis, causing the <span class="companylink">FHA</span> loan limits to fall in 44% of metropolitan U.S. counties, according to an analysis by the <span class="companylink">Urban Institute</span> in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Loan limits in California's Riverside and San Bernardino counties dropped from $500,000 in 2013 to about $355,000 -- a nearly 30% decline overnight. In Clark County, Nev., home to Las Vegas, loan limits fell from $400,000 to $287,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales in the Inland Empire plummeted by more than 30% in the first half of 2014 from the same period a year earlier, according to data firm <span class="companylink">Meyers Research</span>, while sales in the Las Vegas area fell by more than 45%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials at HUD argue that pegging loan limits to median home values is the fairest way to ensure buyers can afford the loans. But critics say limits imposed across an entire metropolitan area fail to account for vast differences within a market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brookfield Residential is among the few builders that have found a way to price homes below the <span class="companylink">FHA</span> price limits in the Inland Empire. The company worked with the city of Ontario to create a master plan that allowed for higher-density townhomes -- allowing the company to cut costs by building more homes on the same piece of land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Darin Fredericks and his wife, Summer, had been house hunting for more than a year in the Inland Empire. They heard about the Brookfield townhomes and were thrilled to discover something below the <span class="companylink">FHA</span> limits. "We were able to walk in the sales office and say: 'We want in,'" he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress Lifted</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ceiling in 2008</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the midst of the financial crisis in 2008, Congress authorized an increase in the maximum <span class="companylink">FHA</span> loan in an effort to stabilize the housing market and infuse credit into the system after private lenders exited in droves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress passed several extensions to the higher loan limits in subsequent years, but opted against another one beyond 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics argued the government needed to scale back its involvement in propping up the housing market, and that there was little public policy need to subsidize loans as high as $729,750 in markets such as New York and Los Angeles.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Chester Dawson </div><div>543 words</div><div>26 October 2016</div><div>21:21</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALGARY, Alberta—<span class="companylink">Suncor Energy Inc</span> ., Canada's largest crude-oil producer, reported a third-quarter net profit of 392 million Canadian dollars ($293 million) late Wednesday, recovering from wild fire-related production cuts and swooning commodity prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Calgary-based company said it earned 24 Canadian cents a share in the three months ended Sept. 30 compared with a net loss of C$376 million, or 26 Canadian cents a share, in the same period last year. In the second quarter, it lost C$735 million, or 46 cents a share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suncor credited increased output from acquisitions, lower operating costs and record crude-processing volumes at its refineries. It also benefited from the resumption of production at oil-sands facilities temporarily closed by the threat from forest fires in May, and an increase in crude-oil prices from lows reached earlier in the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The oil and gas field operator raised its full-year production forecast to a range of 610,000 to 625,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, up from its previous estimate of 585,000 to 620,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. Suncor trimmed its 2016 capital spending budget to between C$5.8 billion and C$6.0 billion, down from a previous projection of C$6 billion to C$6.5 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On an operating, or adjusted, basis that excludes one-time items, the company posted quarterly earnings of C$346 million, or C$0.21 a share. That was below the C$410 million, or C$0.28 a share, it earned in the year-earlier period but above analysts' average forecast for C$0.09 a share, according to <span class="companylink">RBC Dominion Securities Inc</span> .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash flow from operations came to C$2.0 billion, slightly above the C$1.88 billion it generated a year before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suncor is the first major Canadian energy producer to report quarterly results, and its performance is viewed as a barometer for an industry hard hit by a slump in crude-oil prices. <span class="companylink">Cenovus Energy Inc</span> . and <span class="companylink">Husky Energy Inc</span> . post earnings on Thursday and <span class="companylink">Canadian Natural Resources Ltd</span> ., the country's largest natural-gas producer and a large oil-sands operator, does so next week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suncor said oil-sands output rose to 433,700 barrels of oil a day in the July-to-September quarter, just above the 430,300 barrels of oil a day produced a year prior and well above the 177,500 barrels a day logged in the second quarter. That dip resulted from the production outages caused by uncontrolled wild fires that raged around—but didn't damage—its operations in northern Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall production volumes at Suncor averaged 728,100 barrels of oil equivalent a day, up from 330,700 in the previous quarter and above the 566,100 it produced a the year before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those production figures include volumes from the acquisition of <span class="companylink">Canadian Oil Sands Ltd</span> . in March and <span class="companylink">Murphy Oil Corp</span> .'s interest in <span class="companylink">Syncrude Canada Ltd</span> . in April. Those two deals boosted Suncor's ownership in that oil-sands consortium to a controlling 54%. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lots of things can thwart a home sale—ugly décor, a bad location or an unrealistic price. But some homeowners and real-estate agents cite another reason: ghosts[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/video/haunted-house-a-tough-sell/E1DDB29B-AEEA-434D-811C-E72585887863.html].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For help, there's a cottage industry of people who advertise themselves as psychics, ghostbusters and paranormal investigators. Some charge hundreds of dollars to visit "haunted" properties—either in person, or via astral travel—and "clear" them of unwanted spirits. Others are volunteer ghostbusters who comb homes with high-tech gear to suss out paranormal activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jane Phillips, a paranormal investigator and self-described clearer in Santa Fe, N.M., markets her services to real-estate agents because "it's easier to get them to pay for something if it gets their houses sold." Ms. Phillips, 65, was a mortgage banker for 30 years in Minneapolis, before moving to New Mexico in 2008, she said. Since then she has worked on hundreds of homes, mostly locally, charging about $350 to $400.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jobs require her to remove "energetic things," that can include ghosts but can also be portals—energetic holes connected to planets—as well as what she calls dark energies, which are "energies from other dimensions," she said. The work mostly occurs "in my imagination—but my imagination is real," said Ms. Phillips.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suzanne Taylor, the broker/owner of Taylor Properties in Santa Fe, hired Ms. Phillips for six of her home listings, paying between $500 and $750 for services. She recently brought her in on a house listed for about $300,000 in Santa Fe. Ms. Phillips came into the house carrying "dowsing rods," crooked rods that are traditionally used as divination tools for finding buried treasure or water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"She holds them and walks around the house and the rods move on their own," said Ms. Taylor. At the end of the process, Ms. Phillips said she created a "white blanket of light" in her mind to "lift out any stray energies."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shortly thereafter, "I got an offer and closed it," Ms. Taylor said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nicole Sassaman, a designer and home-décor retailer in Los Angeles, has seen her share of weird things in 20 years of flipping houses. But nothing prepared her for the strange occurrences at the fixer-upper she was renovating years ago in the Hollywood Hills neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Doors would swing open. A box of plumbing supplies would move from one corner to the other when we weren't looking. The floors warped for no reason. The house got broken into," said Ms. Sassaman, 45.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About six months into the renovation, a neighbor dropped a bombshell: The former owner had died in the bathroom, Ms. Sassaman said. She paid a clearer $500 to rid the home of "spirits and negative energy." The process, involving crystals, bells and murmured prayers, was weird but effective, Ms. Sassaman said. The problems stopped and the property sold quickly for its asking price of $995,000, nearly twice what she'd paid for it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone in the ghostbusting business automatically assumes that low-pitched hum coming from the basement is a ghost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Eighty percent of the time, it isn't something paranormal at all," said Jason Hawes, the star of "Ghost Hunters," a reality show on the Syfy channel that started in 2004 and is currently in its last season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plumbing, electrical, psychological or medication problems are the most common culprits, said Mr. Hawes, 44, a plumber in Warwick, R.I., who is the founder the Atlantic Paranormal Society, or TAPS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The TAPS Family Network includes 76 groups of paranormal investigators in the U.S. (plus another 40 internationally) who work for free. These groups, usually comprised of 10 to 20 volunteers, visit homes armed with equipment such as thermal imaging cameras, wireless audio recording systems and electromagnetic field detectors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joe Nickell, senior research fellow at the <span class="companylink">Center for Inquiry</span>, an Amherst, N.Y.-based think tank focused on science and secularism, has investigated hundreds of claims of paranormal activity over the past 40 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I have never found evidence of an actual haunting," said Mr. Nickell, 71. "Ghosts must be believed to be seen."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Laws addressing seller disclosures of "psychologically impacting factors" in properties vary widely from state to state, said Val Werness of LegalResearch.com in Minneapolis, which issued a report on disclosures for the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> last year. Only two states, Minnesota and Massachusetts, have laws that even mention reports of paranormal activity, and only to say they need not be disclosed, said Ms. Werness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three other states, California, South Dakota and Alaska, have laws that require some form of disclosure of deaths on a property, even if the buyer doesn't ask about it. (Ms. Sassaman, who sold her house 15 years ago, said her agent told her disclosure wasn't required in the particular case of her house.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some people are content to live amid the spirits. In New Orleans, Keith Teachout, who owns an 1830s Greek Revival bed-and-breakfast in the French Quarter, said he spied a ghost in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Teachout said he was carrying a load of laundry up to his private suite of rooms when he saw a man with a slim build, in his late 50s or early 60s, perched on a settee in the living room. The man looked as real as anyone on the street, Mr. Teachout said, except that he was dressed in a 1940s-style overcoat and fedora. After a few moments, the man disappeared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I assumed he was a ghost," said Mr. Teachout, 55.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About a week later, by coincidence, a police officer stopped by the home and explained that his great-aunt had lived there in her youth. Mr. Teachout said he invited the aunt, now 99 years old, to lunch and learned that her husband had died of a heart attack, wearing his overcoat and fedora, in the very room where Mr. Teachout had spied the ghost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Teachout had met Cari Roy, a well-known psychic medium in New Orleans, at a party, so he called her up and asked her to come and see if she perceived the ghost. Ms. Roy said she has worked on ghost issues in over a hundred houses, hotels, restaurants and bars. For site visits, she typically charges $200 an hour, though she didn't charge Mr. Teachout, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Roy said she sensed the ghost and his reason for hovering: He wanted to protect his widow, she said. Ms. Roy and Mr. Teachout decided not to try to interfere. Ms. Roy considers ghosts part of New Orleans history, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Who am I to throw out a ghost who has been here for hundreds of years?" she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those reluctant to hire a professional ghostbuster, there is a do-it-yourself solution. Last year, Yvonne Arias, owner of Los Angeles brokerage Property Lab, accompanied a client to a walk-through a few days before closing on a $600,000 house. The house was in poor condition—"there was a bad smell, all the windows were caulked shut," said Ms. Arias. But even that didn't account for the "creepy, bad energy" both she and the seller perceived, Ms. Arias said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyer handed Ms. Arias a bundle of sage, which they lighted on fire and toted from room to room. Burning sage to dispel spirits is traditional in several cultures, including some American Indian tribes. A few days later, the property closed as planned, Ms. Arias said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—A gauge of coming U.S. home sales moved higher in September after falling the prior month, extending a recent choppy trend amid tight inventory and low mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Thursday that its pending home sales index[http://www.realtor.org/topics/pending-home-sales], which tracks contract signings for previously owned homes, rose 1.5% from August to a seasonally adjusted 110.0. Sales typically close within a month or two of signing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a more modest rise of 1.0%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This latest increase suggests that existing home sales…will increase in the coming months," J.P. Morgan Chase economist Daniel Silver said in a note to clients. "But even with this latest gain in pending home sales, the trend in the data has softened lately."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index has fluctuated in recent months after spiking in April[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/pending-home-sales-climbed-to-highest-level-in-10-years-1464271244]. It was 111.2 in July and fell in August[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/pending-home-sales-fall-2-4-in-august-1475157822] to 108.4, reduced slightly from an earlier estimate of 108.5, before partly rebounding in September. Compared with a year earlier, pending home sales in September were up 2.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Although depressed inventory levels are keeping home prices elevated in most of the country, steady job gains and growing evidence that wages are finally starting to tick up are encouraging more households to consider buying a home," said Lawrence Yun, the trade group's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The near-term outlook for sales remains uncertain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's report "suggests little change in actual existing home sales in October," MFR Inc. chief U.S. economist Joshua Shapiro said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Pantheon Macroeconomics chief economist Ian Shepherdson said in a note to clients that "existing home sales overshot relative to pending sales in September, so today's data are consistent with a dip in October existing home sales."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of existing homes, which account for roughly 90% of U.S. homebuying activity, peaked in June at an annualized sales rate of 5.57 million, the strongest monthly reading since February 2007. Sales weakened in July and August but rebounded in September[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-rebounded-in-september-1476972399], rising 3.2% from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.47 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowing costs remain low for prospective home buyers. The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in September was 3.46%, down from 3.89% a year earlier, according to Freddie Mac[http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/pmms30.htm].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But tight inventory has put upward pressure on home prices, hindering some would-be buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> officials in September judged that "the sluggishness in the housing sector appeared to have continued into the third quarter," according to minutes of their Sept. 20-21 policy meeting[http://www.federalreserve.gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20160921.htm].</p>

</div><div class="author">By Judy McKinnon </div><div>369 words</div><div>27 October 2016</div><div>08:07</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Husky Energy Inc</span>. posted a third-quarter profit on Thursday, largely due to hefty gains on the sale of energy assets[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/canadas-husky-energy-posts-another-quarterly-loss-1461629202], while production and average prices trailed year-earlier levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Calgary, Alberta-based oil and gas producer has had a string of quarterly losses until now, hurt by a continuing slump in oil prices[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/falling-crude-prices-upend-canadas-oil-sands-projects-1437609134] that has curbed profits in the oil patch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Husky had a net profit of 1.39 billion Canadian dollars ($1.04 billion), or C$1.37 a share, in its latest quarter ended Sept. 30. That compares with a small loss in the second quarter[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/husky-energy-swings-to-a-loss-on-lower-output-1469190601] and a loss of C$4.1 billion a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adjusted to exclude nearly C$1.5 billion of gains on the sale of assets in Western Canada, however, Husky said it lost C$100 million, compared with a loss of C$101 million on the same basis a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company said that, despite the volatility in oil prices over the past two years, its balance sheet is strong and net debt is in line with its target. Husky cut its net debt to C$4.1 billion at the end of the latest quarter from C$6.8 billion a year earlier, helped in part by the C$1.7 billion sale of a group of Canadian midstream assets in April to two Hong Kong-based firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Husky, an affiliate of Hong Kong conglomerate <span class="companylink">CK Hutchison Holdings</span>, said cash flow fell to C$484 million from C$674 million a year earlier. Overall production dipped to 301,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day from 333,000 barrels a day a year earlier, while average realized prices were down about 16% year-over-year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Husky's results come just hours after the company announced a surprise management shuffle that will see its chief operating officer replace its chief executive. Asim Ghosh, chief executive since June 2010, will step down in December and be succeeded by Chief Operating Officer Rob Peabody.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Modest Pace</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuition increases at U.S. colleges rose relatively slowly during the 2016-17 academic year after rapid gains during and after the 2007-09 recession, but stagnant wages, low inflation and a slight pullback in grants continue to amplify those modest jumps and fuel concern about college affordability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Published tuition for the 2016-17 academic year rose about 2.4% for in-state students at four-year public schools -- down from 2.9% last year, according to a report released Wednesday from the College Board, a New York nonprofit that tracks university costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In-state students attending public four-year institutions now pay $20,090 on average for tuition, fees and room and board, up from $19,570 in 2015-16. Private-school costs rose $1,500from the previous academic yearto $45,370.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rose 3.1% Last Month</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of newly built homes rose in September after an August tumble, a sign that modest momentum continues in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of new single-family homes increased 3.1% in September from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 593,000, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through the first nine months of the year, sales were up 13% compared with the same period in 2015. That measure is consistent with other gauges of the housing market showing improvement through most of this year.</p>
