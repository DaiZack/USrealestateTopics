<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation's construction industry, virtually on life support during the economic downturn, will begin a slow recovery next year, according to a forecast set to be released Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next year, the value of new projects that start construction is expected to climb to $445.5 billion, an 8% rise from this year when that figure hit a post-recession low, according to the closely watched McGraw-Hill Construction forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New development of single-family houses, apartment buildings and commercial properties is expected to increase. But there will be less building of new highways, bridges and other public works as federal stimulus money dries up, according to the forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with an increase next year, construction activity will still be far off the boom-year peak it hit in 2006 when there were $689.3 billion in construction starts, according to <span class="companylink">McGraw-Hill</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">McGraw-Hill</span> last year initially forecasted a gain of 11% for 2010, but that projection proved to be overly optimistic.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation's construction industry, virtually on life support during the economic downturn, will begin a slow recovery next year, according to a forecast set to be released Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next year, the value of new projects that start construction is expected to climb to $445.5 billion, an 8% rise from this year when that figure hit a post-recession low, according to the closely watched McGraw-Hill Construction forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New development of single-family houses, apartment buildings and commercial properties is expected to increase. But there will be less building of new highways, bridges and other public works as federal stimulus money dries up, according to the forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with an increase next year, construction activity will still be far off the boom-year peak it hit in 2006 when there were $689.3 billion in construction starts, according to <span class="companylink">McGraw-Hill</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">McGraw-Hill</span> last year initially forecasted a gain of 11% for 2010, but that projection proved to be overly optimistic. Construction starts are estimated to decline 2% from 2009 as a recovery in the housing industry stalled in the middle of the year, credit remained sparse and municipal budget deficits widened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"State and local governments saw their fiscal health erode to a greater extent than previously thought," said Robert Murray, vice president of economic affairs at McGraw-Hill Construction, part of New York-based <span class="companylink">McGraw-Hill Cos</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">McGraw-Hill</span> expects the U.S. economy will grow 2.5% in 2011. "The economy will continue to struggle in 2011 although avoid another recession," Mr. Murray said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among specific sectors, single-family housing should see the strongest rebound in 2011, with $126.7 billion in construction starts, a 27% boost, according to the forecast. But that projection assumes mortgage rates remain low, job growth improves and a resolution is found to the foreclosure documentation mess. The single-family estimate is 60% below the peak in 2005, underscoring how far builders have curtailed construction following the housing boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New construction of multifamily housing is expected to rise 24% to $23.6 billion next year, extending gains from 2010 as a growing number of renters enter the market amid the housing crisis.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meantime, commercial buildings—which includes offices, stores, hotels and warehouses—will improve with a 16% gain to $44.9 billion. But that comes after falling 17% in 2010 and 43% in 2009. In 2010, construction starts hit a 50-year low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">McGraw-Hill</span> projects that construction starts of manufacturing buildings will increase 9% as the drop in value of the U.S. dollar increases demand for U.S. goods.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Filmmakers Chandra and Pierson Silver spent a year looking to buy their first apartment in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. They took their time in what they felt was a buyer's market, until they walked into a designer model apartment at the Solis on Clermont Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Buying your first apartment is emotional, so when we saw the way the apartment was set up and it was perfect, we decided to buy it," Ms. Silver says. "We loved the layout so much we even took most of the furniture."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the real-estate market in New York City slowly rebounds, developers are getting even more aggressive in pushing sales, particularly of new developments that were stalled during the slowdown and are just now coming online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To that end, developers at such buildings as the Aldyn and Setai Fifth Avenue in Manhattan and the Solis and be@schermerhorn apartments in Brooklyn are spending millions of dollars for interior decorators and fashion designers to turn otherwise plain-vanilla model apartments into fashionable residences. They hope using opulent furniture and high fashion will help potential buyers envision the spaces as their own, and ultimately boost sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday night, nearly 600 potential buyers came to the Manhattan House on the Upper East Side as the building unveiled a set of model apartments by interior designers James "Ford" Huniford, Celerie Kemble and Rita Konig called the Modern Collection, a portfolio of residences designed in response to growing consumer demand for larger spaces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The designers were given three months and hundreds of thousands of dollars to design and build out each apartment, which range from one- to four-bedroom units. The work was to have a bent toward creating more space for eventual residents. But other than that and their spending budget, the designers say they were free to search antique shops and paint stores for the makings of distinctive looks for the apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In this market it's all about market differentiation and connecting people with the space," says Ms. Kemble, who designed a 1,861-square-foot, three-bedroom apartment with glazed black lacquer walls, using vintage textiles. "It's not just about looking at the floor plan, it's whether or not I can see myself living here."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An added bonus, she says, is the droves of new clients who call her after the model showings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Designed in 1950 by architect Gordon Bunshaft and now holding landmark status, the Manhattan House was converted into luxury condominiums in 2008. As part of the $1.1 billion conversion, one of the most expensive in the city's history, developer O'Connor Capital Partners added amenities such as a rooftop spa and fitness club. Even so, "the apartments barely moved until the spring of 2009," says partner Brian Fallon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2009, O'Connor switched marketing firms to Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group and plowed more than $2 million into a set of designer model apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, 12 model units have been sold, as well as 20 others that are of similar layouts to the model apartments, representing more than $85 million in sales. Currently, O'Connor has sold about 40% of the available units in Manhattan House.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Most buyers don't have the skill set to envision what their apartments could look like so if we can do it for them, it removes the doubt and suddenly they say, 'I could see myself in that space," says Mr. Fallon, who employed a similar approach at the InterContinental Boston hotel. "For a small investment, this has been a remarkable sales tool."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mumbai will add 30 million square feet of new office space in 2010 and 2011. Dubai will add 20 million square feet, and Shanghai 14 million during the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after a Times Square building is completed next month, the total space in office buildings in New York City isn't expected to grow at all between then and the end of 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While office-building construction is on a tear in emerging markets, it has largely halted in New York and most of the other traditional financial centers of the U.S. Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco will be delivering just 120,000 square feet, 695,000 square feet and 515,000 square feet respectively in 2010 and 2011, according to a recent report by <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Europe is doing better. London is expected to add 5.8 million square feet in the two-year period. Developers in Paris are slated to deliver 12 million square feet, according to <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>. The slowdown in the U.S., of course, is because the weak economy and the credit crunch have made most development financially unfeasible. But as the world economy rebounds and competition heats up among financial centers, the availability of modern office space will play a part in determining winners and losers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think it's dangerous, because people need facilities, and there is no place to go," says New York's Larry Silverstein, the developer of three office towers at the World Trade Center site. Construction on all three Silverstein towers is under way, but only Tower 4 is currently being built to completion. Tower 3 will get a government financial backstop once Mr. Silverstein meets certain triggers; Tower 2 will be built to street level, and its construction will be based on market demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Silverstein notes that 60% of the buildings in New York City are more than 60 years old. "For the most part, I think it serves as a depressant not to have first-class facilities available at the time they want to move to them," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Modern space is particularly important for financial-services firms that need high ceilings, raised floors, column-free space and the latest broadband and telecommunications infrastructure. Newer buildings also tend to be more energy efficient and can be important tools for attracting and retaining top staff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Silverstein is able to build thanks largely to subsidies and the availability of insurance funds. But most developers and real-estate investors in the U.S. say they don't expect construction lending to resume at least for another three years because rents don't justify it. In New York, gross rents would have to increase roughly 30% to justify new unsubsidized construction, experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, buildings are selling for less than it would cost to replace them. The last large-scale office tower set for completion in Manhattan before at least 2012 is 11 Times Square, a 40-story, 1.1-million-square-foot skyscraper that will be officially completed next month. Another new building of that magnitude isn't likely to be able to get a construction loan until gross rents increase about $30 from roughly $82 a square foot currently, say developers and investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You won't see much in the way of speculative development. The financing is not there," says Mitchell Hersh, chief executive of <span class="companylink">Mack-Cali Realty Corp</span>., New Jersey's largest office landlord.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers say there is a positive side to the dearth of construction in the U.S.: The lack of new supply has cushioned the office market from even harsher blows from the economic downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the early 1990s, the market collapsed under tens of millions of square feet of office space that was delivered during a speculative building boom. During the last cycle, while investors bid up the price of existing buildings to exorbitant levels, developers restrained themselves when it came to building new properties. "It's discouraging and a bad barometer for . . . future growth that we're not seeing speculative development," says Peter Riguardi, president of the New York region at <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he adds, "It's actually very prudent given where we are in the markets right now."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 700 stalled building sites coupled with three years of declines in spending have rocked the city's wobbly construction market, but a new report expects the industry to start to rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction spending fell 12% from last year and 23% from 2008 to $23.7 billion, according to a report by the New York Building Congress, an alliance of business, government and labor groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spending declines come in nearly every building category and represent a bleak spot in an otherwise recovering New York real-estate market, which has seen a rebound in sales and rentals over the past few quarters that has defied national housing trends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the Building Congress forecasts construction spending and growth to pick up through 2012, other industry experts aren't sure the rebound will come so quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are literally zero square feet coming online in 2011 and 2012," says Victor Calanog, director of research at Reiss Inc., a real-estate data company. "What's coming online will have opened its doors this year with new building completely frozen."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report is based on information from the state Department of Labor, public capital budgets and plans, as well as the consulting firm Urbanomics and data provider McGraw-Hill Construction Dodge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The construction industry is relying on city and state government funding to pick up the slack left by private developers who helped fuel the latest building boom: Based on a review of agency budgets and projected commitments, the Building Congress said government spending is expected to increase to $15.2 billion in 2011 and $18.6 billion in 2012 from $14.6 billion this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bulk of the projected jump in construction spending in 2012, though, comes from Metropolitan Transportation Authority projects that have no dedicated funding, the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the MTA's planned $3.5 billion in construction spending for 2011 is secure, the agency has yet to announce the additional funding to finance the full $7.6 billion proposed in 2012 through its current capital plan, which runs through 2014. The agency will be working with the city and state to try to fill that gap, a spokesman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2010, government construction spending represented 62% of all New York City construction dollars, marking the highest proportion of public spending since 1996.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The heavy reliance on government spending comes with its own risks, says Robert Murray, chief economist at McGraw-Hill Construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The government sector is going to be critical for near-term support for the construction industry," Mr. Murray says, "but the questions is, as cities grapple with rising budgets and rein in spending, will that money be there?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the residential sector remains in a deep slump, reporting $1.6 billion in spending in 2010, down from $6.2 billion in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Likewise, the commercial construction is being kept afloat by large projects such as the rebuilding of the World Trade Center, the $800 million <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> Arena at Atlantic Yards and $850 million Madison Square Garden redevelopment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slowing growth are the more than 700 stalled construction sites across New York City, 46% of which are in Brooklyn, according to the Department of Buildings, which updates a database of stalled projects weekly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, the city put in place a new law that allows property owners to extend their building permits from 12 months to four years while projects remain on hold, provided they meet certain safety requirements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The changes are good but by itself, it isn't enough to get these projects going," says Richard Anderson, president of the Building Congress. "We're in talks with the city to come up with a more comprehensive program; otherwise it will be saddled with projects for years to come that will be unsightly, dangerous and a real headache."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KBS Realty Advisors Cos., a real-estate investment company that has been making some aggressive office-building acquisitions, is close to yet another bet. An untraded real-estate investment trust managed by Newport Beach, Calif.,-based KBS has agreed to pay about $115 million in cash for the National City Tower in Louisville, Ky., according to a person familiar with the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building last sold in 2005 for about $95 million, according to CoStar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the transaction closes, it would be the highest overall price paid for a Louisville office building since 2004, when the Aegon Center sold for $128.5 million, or about $169 a square foot, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seller is an affiliate of Meridian Investments Inc., according to people familiar with the deal. Meridian officials didn't return calls seeking comment.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Selling foreclosed real estate for the FDIC was supposed to be a bonanza for the brokerages such as <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis Group Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Cushman &amp; Wakefield Inc</span>. that contracted to do so during the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But so far, those contracts, while lucrative, aren't anything close to the windfalls reaped in the early 1990s from managing and selling seized properties for the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp</span>. and the <span class="companylink">Resolution Trust Corp</span>. That is mostly because, this time around, the FDIC has focused more on selling distressed loan portfolios, as the failed banks of this recession largely abstained from foreclosing on commercial property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, 2009 and the first two-thirds of this year, the FDIC sold, mostly through contractors, $257.3 million worth of commercial real estate it inherited from failed banks, FDIC data show. More remains on the books: As of Aug. 31, the FDIC still had $630.5 million of foreclosed commercial property in its possession. What's more, in this year's first eight months, the FDIC sold $255.7 million of foreclosed homes and apartment buildings. It has another $477 million of residential properties still on its hands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All that is nothing compared to the RTC's heyday. From 1990 to 1996, the FDIC and the RTC handled nearly $24 billion of foreclosed real estate inherited from failed banks and thrifts.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the commercial-real-estate market is experiencing a rocky recovery, profits for some commercial-brokerage firms have risen, as the transaction volume has come back from a near standstill in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue for commercial-brokerage firm <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis Group Inc</span>. hit $1.3 billion in the third quarter, a 24% increase from the same period in 2009, the company said Tuesday. Another brokerage, <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle Inc</span>., reported third-quarter revenue of $708 million, an increase of 20% in local currency from the third quarter of 2009. Will Marks, an analyst for JMP Securities, said the increase in revenue reflects "pent-up demand."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While both firms perform a variety of real-estate-related services, such as property management and investment management, some of their strongest performance came in their bread-and-butter business lines, selling and leasing office buildings, warehouses, retail space and other kinds of commercial property. <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span> said its property-sales revenue in the Americas increased 69% in the third quarter compared with a year ago, while leasing revenue was up 36%. <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> reported a 38% increase in leasing revenue and a 127% rise in capital markets and hotels revenue in the Americas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our clients around the world are relatively optimistic about the long term," said <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span> Chief Executive Brett White. "Many of them were on the sidelines the last two and a half years, and are now getting back in the business of doing business."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In particular, Mr. White said, businesses are signing long-term leases of seven years or more after several years of being skittish about committing to anything at all. Both Mr. White and <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> Chief Executive Colin Dyer said they saw rental rates bottoming in major cities around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Leasing markets now in big cities are virtually all bottoming or have bottomed," Mr. Dyer said. "That's driving a new level of tension on the leasing side."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 700 stalled building sites coupled with three years of declines in spending have rocked the city's wobbly construction market, but a new report expects the industry to start to rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction spending fell 12% from last year and 23% from 2008 to $23.7 billion, according to a report by the New York Building Congress, an alliance of business, government and labor groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spending declines come in nearly every building category and represent a bleak spot in an otherwise recovering New York real-estate market, which has seen a rebound in sales and rentals over the past few quarters that have defied national housing trends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the Building Congress forecasts construction spending and growth to pick up through 2012, other industry experts aren't sure the rebound will come so quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are literally zero square feet coming online in 2011 and 2012," says Victor Calanog, director of research at Reiss Inc., a real-estate data company. "What's coming online will have opened its doors this year with new building completely frozen."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report is based on information from the state Department of Labor, public capital budgets and plans, as well as the consulting firm Urbanomics and data provider McGraw-Hill Construction Dodge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The construction industry is relying on city and state government funding to pick up the slack left by private developers who helped fuel the latest building boom: Based on a review of agency budgets and projected commitments, the Building Congress said government spending is expected to increase to $15.2 billion in 2011 and $18.6 billion in 2012 from $14.6 billion this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bulk of the projected jump in construction spending in 2012, though, comes from Metropolitan Transportation Authority projects that have no dedicated funding, the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the MTA's planned $3.5 billion in construction spending for 2011 is secure, the agency has yet to announce the additional funding to finance the full $7.6 billion proposed in 2012 through its current capital plan, which runs through 2014. The agency will be working with the city and state to try to fill that gap, a spokesman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2010 government construction spending represented 62% of all New York City construction dollars, marking the highest proportion of public spending since 1996.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The heavy reliance on government spending comes with its own risks, says Robert Murray, chief economist at McGraw-Hill Construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The government sector is going to be critical for near-term support for the construction industry," Mr. Murray says, "but the questions is, as cities grapple with rising budgets and rein in spending, will that money be there?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the residential sector remains in a deep slump, reporting $1.6 billion in spending in 2010, down from $6.2 billion in 2008. Likewise, the commercial construction is being kept afloat by large projects such as the rebuilding of the World Trade Center, the $800 million <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> Arena at Atlantic Yards and $850 million Madison Square Garden redevelopment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slowing growth are the more than 700 stalled construction sites across New York City, 46% of which are in Brooklyn, according to the Department of Buildings, which updates a database of stalled projects weekly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, the city put in place a new law that allows property owners to extend their building permits from 12 months to four years while projects remain on hold, provided they meet certain safety requirements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The changes are good but by itself, it isn't enough to get these projects going," says Richard Anderson, president of the Building Congress. "We're in talks with the city to come up with a more comprehensive program; otherwise it will be saddled with projects for years to come that will be unsightly, dangerous and a real headache."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anton Troianovski   </div><div>909 words</div><div>27 October 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years ago, <span class="companylink">Vornado Realty Trust</span> Chairman Steven Roth, one of the biggest deal makers in the commercial-real-estate industry, suggested that he wanted to get out of the business of making complex, one-time investments in other companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His resolve didn't last long. This month, Vornado announced its biggest acquisition since 2007: a stake in retail chain <span class="companylink">J.C. Penney Co</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vornado's $600 million investment in <span class="companylink">J.C. Penney</span>, which was made alongside hedge fund <span class="companylink">Pershing Square Capital Management</span>, is further proof that these are frustrating times for investors like Mr. Roth who have built up buying power to take advantage of distressed opportunities in today's turbulent market but are finding little to acquire. With interest rates low and banks avoiding fire sales, very few of the prime assets that buyers like Mr. Roth covet are coming on the market. When they do, bidding wars ensue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Accumulating more than 26% of <span class="companylink">J.C. Penney</span>'s shares is a way for Mr. Roth and William Ackman, head of Pershing, to buy real estate indirectly. They are likely hoping investor pessimism about retailers has masked the higher value of the more than 1,000 stores owned and leased by Penney.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you look at the math and you look at the investment, I think you'll agree it's a pretty terrific investment," Mr. Roth said in a brief interview about the Penney deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The investment follows a decade in which Vornado, long a Wall Street darling, has lurched from one strategy to another amid the market's gyrations, while suffering several missteps. In June 2006, as the bubble expanded, Mr. Roth said that "in this environment over the last 10 years, every single deal we didn't do was a mistake." Vornado went on to buy skyscrapers in San Francisco and New York for $1.8 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three years later, in 2009, Mr. Roth acknowledged the company made the mistake of not selling "everything noncore." "We hesitated as the knife started dropping, and now it's too late," he said in a letter to shareholders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vornado is at risk of losing a $103 million investment in a Springfield, Va., shopping mall, with the lender seeking to sell the defaulted loan through Mission Capital Advisors to a buyer who would likely seek to foreclose, according to people familiar with the matter. High-profile development projects in New York and Boston have been hobbled by the economy and political obstacles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A $1.5 billion foray into mezzanine lending produced "unacceptable results," Mr. Roth acknowledged earlier this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the Penney investment is drawing criticism from analysts who say the deal won't present long-term value for shareholders if Vornado simply makes money on a rising stock price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you think about the long-term growth potential that Vornado has, it's in their real estate," said Alexander Goldfarb, who follows Vornado for <span class="companylink">Sandler O'Neill &amp; Partners LP</span>. "When you're investing in stock, you're just investing in the vagaries of the market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Roth defended the Penney investment, noting his extensive background in retail. "For me to invest in a large retailer—I've done it my whole life, and so this is a perfectly natural investment," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Roth has been buying strapped retailers for their real-estate portfolios since the early 1980s, when he took control of a struggling New Jersey discount retailer named Two Guys From Harrison. Most famously, Mr. Roth in the early 1990s bought into <span class="companylink">Alexander's Inc</span>., a bankrupt retailer that owned Manhattan real estate. The deal paid off years later, when the headquarters of financial-data provider <span class="companylink">Bloomberg LP</span> was built on Alexander's land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1997, Vornado got a foothold in the Manhattan office market by buying stakes in seven office buildings for $700 million. But even as he has amassed one of the country's largest portfolios of real estate, Mr. Roth hasn't been able to resist investing in retailers themselves. In the 2000s, Vornado made money buying stock in <span class="companylink">McDonald's Corp</span>., <span class="companylink">Sears Holdings Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Sears Canada Inc</span>. It still holds a private-equity stake in <span class="companylink">Toys 'R' Us</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in April 2008, Mr. Roth suggested in a letter to shareholders that he would seek to wean the company off of "one-time" deals like investments in <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> and <span class="companylink">Sears Holdings</span> because he didn't believe Wall Street was giving Vornado enough credit for them. "These investments seem to attract too much attention, taking away focus from our much, much larger, strong core business," Mr. Roth wrote. "The order of the day is to simplify and prune."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Penney could be a good real-estate play because investors may be undervaluing Penney's real-estate interests. Vornado could help the retailer profit from its stores by subletting space leased at below-market rates or even redeveloping Penney-owned property in the best locations, analysts and investors say. "It says something about how the property markets are currently priced when they're pursuing a retailer in lieu of physical real-estate assets," said Ian Goltra, who manages portfolios of real-estate stocks for Forward Funds.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mumbai will add 30 million square feet of new office space in 2010 and 2011. Dubai will add 20 million square feet, and Shanghai 14 million during the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after a Times Square building is completed next month, the total space in office buildings in New York City isn't expected to grow at all between then and the end of 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While office-building construction is on a tear in emerging markets, it has largely halted in New York and most of the other traditional financial centers of the U.S. Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco will be delivering just 120,000 square feet, 695,000 square feet and 515,000 square feet respectively in 2010 and 2011, according to a recent report by <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Europe is doing better. London is expected to add 5.8 million square feet in the two-year period. Developers in Paris are slated to deliver 12 million square feet, according to <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>. The slowdown in the U.S., of course, is because the weak economy and the credit crunch have made most development financially unfeasible. But as the world economy rebounds and competition heats up among financial centers, the availability of modern office space will play a part in determining winners and losers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think it's dangerous, because people need facilities, and there is no place to go," says New York's Larry Silverstein, the developer of three office towers at the World Trade Center site. Construction on all three Silverstein towers is under way, but only Tower 4 is currently being built to completion. Tower 3 will get a government financial backstop once Mr. Silverstein meets certain triggers; Tower 2 will be built to street level, and its construction will be based on market demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Silverstein notes that 60% of the buildings in New York City are more than 60 years old. "For the most part, I think it serves as a depressant not to have first-class facilities available at the time they want to move to them," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Modern space is particularly important for financial-services firms that need high ceilings, raised floors, column-free space and the latest broadband and telecommunications infrastructure. Newer buildings also tend to be more energy efficient and can be important tools for attracting and retaining top staff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Silverstein is able to build thanks largely to subsidies and the availability of insurance funds. But most developers and real-estate investors in the U.S. say they don't expect construction lending to resume at least for another three years because rents don't justify it. In New York, gross rents would have to increase roughly 30% to justify new unsubsidized construction, experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, buildings are selling for less than it would cost to replace them. The last large-scale office tower set for completion in Manhattan before at least 2012 is 11 Times Square, a 40-story, 1.1-million-square-foot skyscraper that will be officially completed next month. Another new building of that magnitude isn't likely to be able to get a construction loan until gross rents increase about $30 from roughly $82 a square foot currently, say developers and investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You won't see much in the way of speculative development. The financing is not there," says Mitchell Hersh, chief executive of <span class="companylink">Mack-Cali Realty Corp</span>., New Jersey's largest office landlord. On the other hand, some companies are interested in "build-to-suit" properties, or buildings custom-made for one large tenant, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers say there is a positive side to the dearth of construction in the U.S.: The lack of new supply has cushioned the office market from even harsher blows from the economic downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the early 1990s, the market collapsed under tens of millions of square feet of office space that was delivered during a speculative building boom. During the last cycle, while investors bid up the price of existing buildings to exorbitant levels, developers restrained themselves when it came to building new properties. "It's discouraging and a bad barometer for … future growth that we're not seeing speculative development," says Peter Riguardi, president of the New York region at <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he adds, "It's actually very prudent given where we are in the markets right now."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KBS Realty Advisors Cos., a real-estate investment company that has been making some aggressive office-building acquisitions, is close to yet another bet. An untraded real-estate investment trust managed by Newport Beach, Calif.,-based KBS has agreed to pay about $115 million in cash for the National City Tower in Louisville, Ky., according to a person familiar with the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 38-story 712,533-square-foot building in Louisville's central business district was built in 1972 and is 94% leased, according to <span class="companylink">CoStar Group Inc</span>., a real-estate research firm. The building last sold in 2005 for about $95 million, according to CoStar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the transaction closes, it would be the highest overall price paid for a Louisville office building since 2004, when the Aegon Center sold for $128.5 million, or about $169 a square foot, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>. KBS has made other bold moves. Over the summer, KBS REIT II acquired a trophy office building at 300 North LaSalle in Chicago for about $655 million, or about $500 a square foot, the most ever paid for a Chicago office building on a square-foot basis, according to Real Capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seller is an affiliate of Meridian Investments Inc., according to people familiar with the deal. Meridian officials didn't return calls seeking comment.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It Ain't Like the '90s</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Selling foreclosed real estate for the FDIC was supposed to be a bonanza for the brokerages such as <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis Group Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Cushman &amp; Wakefield Inc</span>. that contracted to do so during the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But so far, those contracts, while lucrative, aren't anything close to the windfalls reaped in the early 1990s from managing and selling seized properties for the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp</span>. and the <span class="companylink">Resolution Trust Corp</span>. That is mostly because, this time around, the FDIC has focused more on selling distressed loan portfolios, as the failed banks of this recession largely abstained from foreclosing on commercial property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, 2009 and the first two-thirds of this year, the FDIC sold, mostly through contractors, $257.3 million worth of commercial real estate it inherited from failed banks, FDIC data show. More remains on the books: As of Aug. 31, the FDIC still had $630.5 million of foreclosed commercial property in its possession. What's more, in this year's first eight months, the FDIC sold $255.7 million of foreclosed homes and apartment buildings. It has another $477 million of residential properties still on its hands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All that is nothing compared to the RTC's heyday. From 1990 to 1996, the FDIC and the RTC handled nearly $24 billion of foreclosed real estate inherited from failed banks and thrifts.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pre-emptive Pay Hike</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's good to be wanted, as Donald Wood, president and chief executive of shopping center landlord <span class="companylink">Federal Realty Investment Trust</span>, learned this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wood was a favored candidate as a committee of <span class="companylink">General Growth Properties Inc</span>.'s board searched for the mall owner's next CEO, people familiar with the talks said. He went "well into the process" with the board committee, conducting several interviews, these people said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once Federal's board was informed that its man might depart, it acted. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission made Oct. 13, Federal outlined a generous increase in Mr. Wood's pay aimed at rewarding him for Federal's strong performance and countering "the active recruiting for Mr. Woods' services in the marketplace."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wood's salary was boosted to $850,000 from $700,000. His maximum bonus jumped to 150% of his salary from 100%. His potential equity bonus in Federal's long-term incentive award program over three years rose to $4 million from $2 million. And he received a grant of $5 million worth of Federal stock in exchange for his agreement that, if he leaves Federal, he won't join any competing real-estate company for a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General Growth is now finalizing a pact for <span class="companylink">Vornado Realty Trust</span>executive Sandeep Mathrani to become its next CEO.

With interest rates low and banks avoiding fire sales, very few of the prime assets that buyers like Mr. Roth covet are coming on the market. When they do, bidding wars ensue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Accumulating more than 26% of <span class="companylink">J.C. Penney</span>'s shares is a way for Mr. Roth and William Ackman, head of Pershing, to buy real estate indirectly. They are likely hoping that investor pessimism about retailers has masked the higher value of the more than 1,000 stores owned and leased by Penney.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you look at the math and you look at the investment, I think you'll agree it's a pretty terrific investment," Mr. Roth said in a brief interview about the Penney deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The investment follows a decade in which Vornado, long a Wall Street darling, has lurched from one strategy to another amid the market's gyrations, while suffering several missteps. In June 2006 as the bubble expanded, Mr. Roth said that "in this environment over the last 10 years, every single deal we didn't do was a mistake." Vornado went on to buy skyscrapers in San Francisco and New York for $1.8 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three years later, in 2009, Mr. Roth acknowledged the company made the mistake of not selling "everything noncore." "We hesitated as the knife started dropping, and now it's too late," he said in a letter to shareholders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vornado is at risk of losing a $103 million investment in a Springfield, Va., shopping mall, with the lender seeking to sell the defaulted loan through Mission Capital Advisors to a buyer who would likely seek to foreclose, according to people familiar with the matter. High-profile development projects in New York and Boston have been hobbled by the economy and political obstacles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A $1.5 billion foray into mezzanine lending produced "unacceptable results," Mr. Roth acknowledged earlier this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the Penney investment is drawing criticism from analysts who say the deal won't create long-term value for shareholders if Vornado simply makes money on a rising stock price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you think about the long-term growth potential that Vornado has, it's in their real estate," said Alexander Goldfarb, who follows Vornado for <span class="companylink">Sandler O'Neill &amp; Partners LP</span>. "When you're investing in stock, you're just investing in the vagaries of the market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Roth defended the Penney investment, noting his extensive background in retail. "For me to invest in a large retailer -- I've done it my whole life, and so this is a perfectly natural investment," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Roth has been buying strapped retailers for their real-estate portfolios since the early 1980s, when he took control of a struggling New Jersey discount retailer named Two Guys From Harrison. Most famously, Mr. Roth in the early 1990s bought into <span class="companylink">Alexander's Inc</span>., a bankrupt retailer that owned Manhattan real estate. The deal paid off years later, when the headquarters of financial-data provider <span class="companylink">Bloomberg LP</span> was built on Alexander's land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1997, Vornado got a foothold in the Manhattan office market by buying stakes in seven office buildings for $700 million. But even as he has amassed one of the country's largest portfolios of real estate, Mr. Roth hasn't been able to resist investing in retailers themselves. In the 2000s Vornado made money buying stock in <span class="companylink">McDonald's Corp</span>., <span class="companylink">Sears Holdings Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Sears Canada Inc</span>. It still holds a private-equity stake in <span class="companylink">Toys 'R' Us</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in April 2008, Mr. Roth suggested in a letter to shareholders that he would seek to wean the company off of "one-time" deals like investments in <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> and <span class="companylink">Sears Holdings</span> because he didn't believe Wall Street was giving Vornado enough credit for them. "These investments seem to attract too much attention, taking away focus from our much, much larger, strong core business," Mr. Roth wrote. "The order of the day is to simplify and prune."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Penney could be a good real-estate play because investors may be undervaluing Penney's real-estate interests. Vornado could potentially help the retailer profit from its stores by subletting space leased at below-market rates or even redeveloping Penney-owned property that's in the best locations, analysts and investors say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It says something about how the property markets are currently priced when they're pursuing a retailer in lieu of physical real-estate assets," said Ian Goltra, who manages portfolios of real-estate stocks for Forward Funds.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos </div><div>989 words</div><div>26 October 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales picked up in September, but the long-term picture for housing is growing grimmer, say analysts and economists who are pushing back forecasts for a housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, the housing market appeared poised for a turnaround. Federal tax credits for buyers spurred a flurry of activity, and the economy was adding jobs. That led some economists to forecast housing would hit bottom and begin to recover this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, some economists don't see a recovery until late next year or early 2012. "In most markets, the tide seems to be going back out," said Stan Humphries, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span>, a real-estate site. "The momentum is easing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding to the mounting worries is the foreclosure crisis. Some banks suspended sales of foreclosed homes late last month to address questions about the integrity of the foreclosure process. If a substantial part of the market freezes for some weeks, that could further crimp sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, the National Association of Realtors said sales of previously owned homes ran at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.53 million in September. While that was up 10% from August, the overall level of sales remains weak, and economists believe sales going forward could fall again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, half of the 109 economists and housing analysts polled this month by MacroMarkets LLC, a housing-futures firm, expect home prices to bottom next year, but half don't expect a rebound until 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The growing pessimism is attributed partly to rising inventory in many markets, a trend that doesn't bode well for prices. The Wall Street Journal's latest quarterly survey of housing-market conditions in 28 major metropolitan areas found inventories of unsold homes were up in 19 markets at the end of the third quarter, compared with a year ago, with especially large increases in San Diego, Los Angeles and Sacramento.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We'll see some additional price declines," said David Berson, chief economist at <span class="companylink">PMI Group Inc</span>., a mortgage-insurance company in Walnut Creek, Calif. "The gains we've seen can't be sustained given the current supply situation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market typically plays a big role as the economy exits from recession, with a rebound in new home building sparking demand for construction workers and building supplies. "We're clearly not getting that this time," said <span class="companylink">MF Global</span> economist James O'Sullivan. It's a major reason, he said, that the recovery that began last year has been so lackluster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, the housing market is faring better in several metro areas, particularly those with decent job growth such as parts of Texas and Washington, D.C. And the National Association of Realtors said it believed a housing recovery was already taking place, though chief economist Lawrence Yun said it would be "choppy at times."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But other economists say any talk of a recovery is premature until prices stabilize. In the Realtors' report, the median home price fell 2.4% to $171,700 in September from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest data don't reflect the suspensions of some foreclosure sales. Monday's home-sales report noted that foreclosures and other distressed sales accounted for more than one-third of transactions in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, Nina Kachakova was days from closing on a two-bedroom home in Sunrise, Fla. But <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> pulled the listing after <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>., which had serviced the loan on the property, announced it was suspending foreclosures. In a letter, Fannie asked to extend the closing until next Tuesday, but added the "extension does not guarantee resolution of title defect within this time frame."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Kachakova, who had been outbid on nearly a dozen other properties since May, has already paid $1,800 for an appraisal, home inspection and loan-origination and processing fees for the $135,000 home. "Right now, it's just a waiting game, and I don't know if I should start all over," said the 24-year-old bookkeeper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some already-skittish home buyers are asking sellers to further lower their prices to offset the costs of delays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kelly Hoemann, 30, chose not to renew the lease on her apartment after going into contract on the $85,000 two-bedroom home in St. Petersburg, Fla., earlier this month. She now faces a foreclosure-related delay. "Come November 1, I don't have a place to live," said Ms. Hoemann, who asked <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> to consider lowering the sales price to $75,000, to give her an incentive to ride out the delay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the mortgage bankers' annual convention in Atlanta Monday, <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> Chief Executive Michael Williams emphasized the need to fix problems quickly "so it doesn't create an overhang of [bank-owned] property."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recovery could be interrupted most severely in Florida, New Jersey and other "judicial" states where banks must complete foreclosures through court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Long after other parts of the country have burned off their excess foreclosure inventory, we will still be digesting ours, that's for sure," said Jeffrey Otteau, president of Otteau Valuation Group, an East Brunswick, N.J., appraisal firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the current sales pace, it would take nearly 10.7 months to sell the nation's inventory of 4.04 million homes, according to the Monday report by the NAR. Six to eight months of inventory is considered healthy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market isn't likely to improve until job and income growth picks up. Other intractable problems include high rates of homeowners who owe more than their homes are worth, and the "shadow" inventory of loans, estimated at around four million, that are in some stage of foreclosure, or that have missed three or more mortgage payments.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Amy Ma   </div><div>359 words</div><div>26 October 2010</div><div>10:05</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Would James Bond Live in an "aquaminium?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property developer Gulu Lalvani, says he created the term to describe an apartment complex on the water with one notable added feature —an indoor parking garage for a boat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Royal Phuket Marina, where Mr. Lalvani is chief executive officer, these garages are available in just two penthouse units; the other apartments have outdoor docking stations. But according to Mr. Lalvani, who founded with his brother the U.K. consumer-electronics company Binatone, the latest must-have in luxury living is a dock just steps from your front door.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea came from James Bond, says Mr. Lalvani. In the movies, the British secret agent often needs to make a quick getaway by boat, and of course, a fast boat is always close at hand. (The nearby island of Khoah Phing Kan is nicknamed "James Bond Island" because it appeared in "The Man with the Golden Gun" in 1974.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Aquiminium complex was completed in 2009. Of the 15 apartments, two penthouses, and five villas in the development, 14 units are occupied. The remaining units are priced up to $10.5 million. A second complex is in the works.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The list of residents is a closely guarded secret. However, the marina did reveal that 10 units are apparently owned by chief executives from Hong Kong and Singapore in various industries. Among the well-to-do, according to the marina, are two Taiwanese tycoons—one in the semiconductors industry and the other in children's garments— and an Englishman who made his fortune replicating antique-furniture designs in Asia. Also joining the neighborhood is a long-term Phuket resident and famed restaurateur, the marina said. Though Mr. Lalvani is looking for buyers from mainland China, thus far, there have been none.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The marina's developers say that hobnobbing with such power folk will no doubt be a bonus to other tempted buyers. One British businessman who now lives there said, the Aquaminium community will be a "place where you can meet up with like-minded people."</p>

The conservative mayor of Castellammare di Stabia, Luigi Bobbio, says he wants to restore public decorum through a set of norms that include banning football games in public parks, blasphemy and "very succinct clothes." The rules were expected to be approved by the city council. The Italian press has interpreted the norms as meaning a ban on miniskirts, low-cut shirts and high heels. Bobbio has said that miniskirts and other provocative outfits will still be allowed as long as they are not too revealing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The European Union agreed to review in detail Serbia's request to join the bloc, an application that is warmly endorsed by Washington but that divides EU members. Serbia's membership request has been gathering dust since it was filed on Dec. 22, 2009, as the EU struggled with a decision on a candidate nation that was party to several wars during the breakup of Yugoslavia. EU foreign ministers have said Serbia's entry would ultimately be determined by whether it makes an effort to arrest Ratko Mladic, an ethnic Serb wanted by a United Nations tribunal for alleged war crimes in neighboring Bosnia, that include the murder of 8,000 men and boys in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica.[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB40001424052702304388304575574072413349684.html]</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales picked up in September, but the long-term picture for housing is growing grimmer, say analysts and economists who are pushing back forecasts for a housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, the housing market appeared poised for a turnaround, three years after it peaked. Federal tax credits for buyers spurred a flurry of activity, and the economy was adding jobs. That led some economists to forecast housing would hit bottom and begin to recover this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, some economists don't see a recovery until late next year or early 2012. "In most markets, the tide seems to be going back out," said Stan Humphries, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span>, a real-estate site. "The momentum is easing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding to the mounting worries is the foreclosure crisis. Some banks suspended sales of foreclosed homes late last month to address questions about the integrity of the foreclosure process. If a substantial part of the market freezes for some weeks, that could further crimp sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, the National Association of Realtors said sales of previously owned homes ran at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.53 million in September. While that was up 10% from August, the overall level of sales remains weak, and economists believe sales going forward could fall again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, half of the 109 economists and housing analysts polled this month by MacroMarkets LLC, a housing-futures firm, expect home prices to bottom next year, but half don't expect a rebound until 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The growing pessimism is attributed partly to rising inventory in many markets, a trend that doesn't bode well for prices. The Wall Street Journal's latest quarterly survey of housing-market conditions in 28 major metropolitan areas found inventories of unsold homes were up in 19 markets at the end of the third quarter, compared with a year ago, with especially large increases in San Diego, Los Angeles and Sacramento.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We'll see some additional price declines," said David Berson, chief economist at <span class="companylink">PMI Group Inc</span>., a mortgage-insurance company in Walnut Creek, Calif. "The gains we've seen can't be sustained given the current supply situation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market typically plays a big role as the economy exits from recession, with a rebound in new home building sparking demand for construction workers and building supplies. "We're clearly not getting that this time," said <span class="companylink">MF Global</span> economist James O'Sullivan. It's a major reason, he said, that the recovery that began last year has been so lackluster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, the housing market is faring better in several metro areas, particularly those with decent job growth such as parts of Texas and Washington, D.C. And the National Association of Realtors said it believes a housing recovery is already taking place, though chief economist Lawrence Yun said it would be "choppy at times."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But other economists say any talk of a recovery is premature until prices stabilize. In the Realtors' report, the median home price fell 2.4% to $171,700 in September from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest data don't reflect the suspensions of some foreclosure sales. Monday's home-sales report noted that foreclosures and other distressed sales accounted for more than one-third of transactions in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This mess threatens to dampen activity in the one area where we see the market strengthening," said Michael Feder, chief executive of real-estate data firm Radar Logic Inc., referring to foreclosure sales. "There's no way this helps. This is bad for the housing market, full stop."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, Nina Kachakova was days from closing on a two-bedroom home in Sunrise, Fla. But <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> pulled the listing after <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>., which had serviced the loan on the property, announced it was suspending foreclosures. In a letter, Fannie asked to extend the closing until next Tuesday, but added the "extension does not guarantee resolution of title defect within this time frame."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Kachakova, who had been outbid on nearly a dozen other properties since May, has already paid $1,800 for an appraisal, home inspection and loan-origination and processing fees for the $135,000 home. "Right now, it's just a waiting game, and I don't know if I should start all over," said the 24-year-old bookkeeper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some already-skittish home buyers are asking sellers to further lower their prices to offset the costs of delays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kelly Hoemann, 30, chose not to renew the lease on her apartment after going into contract on the $85,000 two-bedroom home in St. Petersburg, Fla., earlier this month. She now faces a foreclosure-related delay. "Come November 1, I don't have a place to live," said Ms. Hoemann, who asked <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> to consider lowering the sales price to $75,000, to give her an incentive to ride out the delay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the mortgage bankers' annual convention in Atlanta Monday, <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> Chief Executive Michael Williams emphasized the need to fix problems quickly "so it doesn't create an overhang of [bank-owned] property."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recovery could be interrupted most severely in Florida, New Jersey and other "judicial" states where banks must complete foreclosures through court. Listings of bank-owned homes in Florida's Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties last week were down by 19% from two weeks earlier, according to Condo Vultures, a real-estate research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Long after other parts of the country have burned off their excess foreclosure inventory, we will still be digesting ours, that's for sure," said Jeffrey Otteau, president of Otteau Valuation Group, an East Brunswick, N.J., appraisal firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the current sales pace, it would take nearly 10.7 months to sell the nation's inventory of 4.04 million homes, according to the Monday report by the NAR. Six to eight months of inventory is considered healthy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market isn't likely to improve until job and income growth picks up. Other intractable problems include high rates of homeowners who owe more than their homes are worth, and the "shadow" inventory of loans, estimated at around four million, that are in some stage of foreclosure, or that have missed three or more mortgage payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Joe Consumer doesn't know the term 'shadow inventory,' but they're hearing more and more that the banks are going to be dumping more homes for sale next year, so they're thinking, 'Why should I buy this year?" said John Burns, an Irvine, Calif., housing consultant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index will report home prices for the three-month period ended in August, offering the first indication of how sellers have responded to the drop-off in sales earlier this summer. Economists at <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>. forecast that prices in August and September declined by an estimated 0.4% and 0.5%, respectively. Their estimates are based on reported declines in sellers' asking prices over that time period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing markets could be in far worse shape without mortgage rates that are at their lowest rates in nearly 60 years. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage stood at 4.21% last week with 0.8% in fees, according to a survey by <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a sign of improvement in housing market conditions, existing home sales rose by more than expected in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of used homes increased by 10.0% to an annual rate of 4.53 million, the National Association of Realtors said Monday. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had expected existing home sales to rise by 5.3% to an annual rate of 4.35 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in home sales was the second in a row. In August, resales rose 7.3% to a rate of 4.12 million, revised down from an originally reported 7.6% increase to a 4.13 million rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, even with this latest increase, existing home sales are well below where they were a year ago. Year-over-year, existing home sales were down 19.1% from an annual rate of a 5.60 million-unit pace in September 2009. Lawrence Yun, the chief economist at NAR, said a 5 million unit pace is the mark he's looking for as a sign that the housing market can once again "stand on its feet."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the third month of new data since a government tax credit for home buyers has expired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is still much lower than what I would consider to be fully healthy, but at least a recovery is taking place," he said. "It is a natural healing process without that stimulus medicine."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has had a hard time recovering from the bursting of the industry's bubble. The federal government created a subsidy for first-time home buyers to help the sector, but that tax credit expired last spring, causing home sales to plunge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And as the housing industry has been struggling to recover, another crisis has emerged. The state and federal government has launched an investigation into foreclosure practices amid growing concerns about mortgage servicers' use of "robo-signers" to approve large numbers of foreclosure documents without reviewing their contents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several major banks including <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, <span class="companylink">Ally Financial Inc</span>.'s GMAC Mortgage and <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> had temporarily halted foreclosures, although foreclosures in some states have since resumed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> initially insisted there were no problems with the foreclosures, but just acknowledged for the first time some mistakes were made including misspelled names, an incorrect address and a missing signature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some have worried the recent concerns over foreclosures will have a chilling effect on an already-struggling housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, low mortgage rates haven't been enough to entice Would-be home buyers thanks to high unemployment and other signs of a still-soft economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices have fallen since the housing bubble popped. While lower prices are tempting, there is a downside. Some would-be buyers watching prices dropping will wait for a better deal. That hurts sales in the near-term. Another problem is some owners, waiting for prices to rise, will keep their property off the market, adding to inventory. High inventories add more pressure to already depressed home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data Monday said the median price for an existing home was $171,700 in September. That's down 2.4% from $175,900 in September 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories of used homes decreased by 1.9% at the end of September to 4.04 million available for sale. That represented a 10.7-month supply at the current sales pace, compared with a 12.0-month supply in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regionally in September, existing home sales increased 5.0% in the West compared to the prior month, 10.1% in the Northeast, 10.6% in the South, and 14.5% in the Midwest.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home construction rose last month, suggesting that the lull in the housing market that followed the expiration of home-buyer tax breaks in the spring has ended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">September construction starts on single-family homes rose 4.4% from August, an annual rate of 468,000, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. Overall housing starts, which include groundbreakings on apartment and other multifamily buildings, increased 0.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 610,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though the level of monthly housing starts is up from an average of 530,000 in the first quarter of 2009, by the standards of the past 50 years it is still low, noted New York Federal Reserve Bank President William Dudley in remarks to reporters Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"One reason why so little housing is being built is that many existing homes stand vacant," he said. "We estimate that there are roughly three million vacant housing units more than usual. And more vacancies are added daily as the foreclosure process moves homes from families to mortgage lenders."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>., after imposing a moratorium on foreclosures earlier this month on documentation concerns, reopened more than 100,000 foreclosure actions Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The combination of weak demand and the large supply of vacant homes for sale will leave housing starts subdued for several years, said Paul Dales, economist at Capital Economics. "We doubt that housing starts will reach one million before 2015," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Dallas Bomb Plot</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Jordanian man caught in an FBI sting trying to blow up a Dallas skyscraper was sentenced Tuesday to 24 years in prison after telling the court he was ashamed of his actions and renouncing al Qaeda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hosam Smadi, 20 years old, faced up to life in prison but received a reduced sentence after pleading guilty in May to attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm so ashamed for what I did. I'm very sorry for my actions," Mr. Smadi told U.S. District Judge Barbara Lynn just before he was sentenced. "I could not live with myself if I had hurt anybody."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Smadi acknowledged leaving what he thought was a truck bomb in a garage beneath the 60-story Fountain Place building in September 2009.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are Offered $680 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration agreed Tuesday to pay up to $680 million to American Indian farmers to settle an 11-year-old class-action lawsuit alleging discrimination by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, who took office promising to address longstanding complaints by minority farmers against the department, said eligible farmers and ranchers can receive up to $250,000 each for showing that USDA discrimination caused them economic losses. However, most farmers will probably opt for a uniform $50,000 payment, which involves less red tape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the class-action suit, American Indian farmers allege that USDA bureaucrats denied them the low-interest rate loans given to white farmers between 1981 and 2007.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although New York is recovering from the economic downturn, the rest of the region isn't following suit, New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley said Tuesday in an update on regional economic conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In New Jersey, although activity is no longer declining, there has yet to be a sustained recovery," Mr. Dudley said. "Its economy remains essentially flat."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The region's housing cycle has been less severe than in other parts of the country, as home prices stabilize and sales rise, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the New York Fed says it continues to monitor factors that could undercut the home prices in New York state, the 12 northern counties of New Jersey and Fairfield County, Conn., which it oversees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those factors include little to no job growth in high-paying sectors like the securities markets; uncertainty over the financial industry and the size of this year's bonuses; the tens of thousands of new housing units coming down the pipeline; and the widening gap between home prices and rents, which is making renting more attractive than buying for consumers, according to a presentation by Jason Bram, a senior economist at the New York Fed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private-sector employment in New York state and New Jersey is fairly flat over its year-ago level and government hiring remains weak, the Fed's presentation illustrated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unemployment rates hover at exceptionally high levels: August's seasonally adjusted rates topped 9.8% in New Jersey's Bergen and Hudson counties and 9.4% in New York City, compared with the national rate of 9.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed said the region was spared the worst effects of the mortgage boom and bust, with fewer delinquencies and foreclosures than the rest of the country, but pockets of housing distress persist in the Bronx, Queens and Long Island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the pullback, Manhattan's average home prices are still 3 1/2 times as high as in 1995, a period over which rents roughly doubled, the Fed said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home construction rose last month, suggesting that the lull in the housing market that followed the expiration of home-buyer tax breaks in the spring has ended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">September construction starts on single-family homes rose 4.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 452,000, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. Overall housing starts, which include groundbreakings on apartment and other multifamily buildings, increased 0.3% from August to an annual rate of 610,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though the level of monthly housing starts is up from an average of 530,000 in the first quarter of 2009, by the standards of the past 50 years, it is still low, noted New York Federal Reserve Bank President William Dudley in remarks to reporters Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"One reason why so little housing is being built is that many existing homes stand vacant," he said. "We estimate that there are roughly three million vacant housing units more than usual. And more vacancies are added daily as the foreclosure process moves homes from families to mortgage lenders."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>., after imposing a moratorium on foreclosures earlier this month amid documentation concerns, reopened more than 100,000 foreclosure actions Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The combination of weak demand and the large supply of vacant homes for sale will leave housing starts subdued for several years, said Paul Dales, economist at Capital Economics. "We doubt that housing starts will reach one million before 2015," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regionally, housing starts in September increased 4.8% in the South and 2.9% in the Northeast. They fell 8.2% in the Midwest, and 3.6% in the West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits for single-homes, seen as an indicator of future construction, edged up to 405,000 in September from 403,000 in August. But weighed down by a drop in permits for multifamily homes, overall permits fell by 5.6% to 571,000.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rezoning of 75 blocks in the central Bronx breezed through the city's land-use-approval process. But the next step promises to be more difficult: encouraging new construction in a long-overlooked part of the borough at a time of economic uncertainty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The City Council last week gave its final approval to the rezoning proposal, which revamps development restrictions that have been in place since 1961 -- a time when an elevated train still rumbled above Third Avenue. Together with another plan now under review to rezone a nearly two-mile stretch of Webster Avenue, city planners hope to revitalize and create new housing in a swath of the Bronx north and west of the New York Botanical Gardens and the Bronx Zoo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan adopted last week permits residential and commercial uses on the stretch of Third Avenue from the Cross-Bronx Expressway to Fordham Road, replacing regulations that largely called for automotive shops and light-industrial facilities there. The city hopes that new regulations allowing larger buildings to be built will create a more bustling business district along East Tremont Avenue, one of the only shopping areas in the central Bronx.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tracks of the Third Avenue "El," which guided many of the area's longtime zoning regulations, were demolished in 1973. The new plan will "reactivate Third Avenue and reinforce Tremont Avenue as the area's downtown," City Planning Commissioner Amanda Burden said when proposing the rezoning in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But community leaders now have to wait to see whether developers choose to take advantage of the rezoning despite the uncertain economy. "There may be people out there who were just waiting for this to happen," says Ivene Galarza, district manager for the area's community board. "Things will start materializing from here on."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One optimistic developer is Radame Perez of Mastermind Management Ltd., a Bronx-based company that owns apartments and commercial space across the New York area. Mr. Perez has a plan to build a high-rise apartment building, the Tremont Renaissance, on East Tremont Avenue with as much as 100,000 square feet of commercial space. He says the new zoning will allow him to increase the size of the project from about 120 residential units to at least 160, and he predicts he'll be ready to start construction as early as next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have to configure apartment sizes and really start to get to work now," Mr. Perez says. "We'll be able to present our plan now to the banks and to the city."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Maura Webber Sadovi   </div><div>874 words</div><div>13 October 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>C8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese investment in U.S. real estate is bigger than meets the eye because of investors like David Liu.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Liu, who was born in China and is a U.S. citizen, has become one of the largest buyers of rental-apartment buildings in the U.S. this year, paying roughly $480 million for about 8,000 units. In his most recent deal, his company, Standard Portfolios, paid about $133 million in cash and assumed debt for seven Phoenix-area apartment complexes previously owned by Bethany Group of Irvine, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Liu's money comes from profits from his ventures in China, where he has condominiums and other commercial real-estate projects in such cities as Beijing, according to Mark Osgood, Mr. Liu's U.S. adviser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Mr. Liu's deals aren't counted when market-data companies like <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span> record foreign investment because Standard Portfolios is based in California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Counting only those investors based in China, there has been just $62.6 million of Chinese investment in U.S. commercial real estate this year, putting China 12th in a ranking of countries, according to Real Capital. By comparison, Canada was the biggest source of foreign investment in U.S. real estate this year, with about $1.8 billion invested through August, its list shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But other forms of Chinese investment clearly are on the rise as that country's economy generates billions of dollars of surplus cash looking for opportunities. For example, China's sovereign-wealth fund, <span class="companylink">China Investment Corp</span>., has been exploring buying stakes in U.S.-focused real-estate funds. These investments, should they occur, wouldn't be counted by Real Capital because CIC wouldn't be buying property directly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There likely are numerous other wealthy individuals who use their own money made in China to invest in the U.S. as well as others who invest money from investors located in China and who are operating beneath the radar. Many are looking for opportunity in the thousands of distressed properties on the market resulting from the economic downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a lot of foreign money coming in through intermediaries, so it's not showing up in these numbers," says Ben Carlos Thypin, a senior market analyst with Real Capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Liu declined to be interviewed for this article. But others who have worked with him say his two largest deals demonstrate that he has both the patience needed to wade through the details of distressed assets and the capital needed to convince sellers that he is serious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Liu founded Standard late last year and soon began amassing U.S. apartments, according to Mr. Osgood. Mr. Liu's U.S. real-estate investments had previously been limited to some raw land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now in his 50s, Mr. Liu has had a home in the U.S. for the past decade or so, Mr. Osgood says. He divides his time between Beijing and the home that he shares with his wife outside Los Angeles. He has a daughter who attends a university in the U.S., Mr. Osgood says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Liu expects recent high foreclosure rates to push more tenants into the rental market and help stabilize property prices in even the most battered regions like Phoenix. Mr. Liu is looking to make similar acquisitions, particularly in the western U.S., Mr. Osgood says. "He wants scale," Mr. Osgood says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The acquisitions come as the nation's apartment market is strengthening. The national apartment-vacancy rate stood at 7.2% at the end of the third quarter, down from 7.9% at the end of the third quarter a year ago, according to <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>. Analysts credit the rebound to the dearth of new supply as well as improving demand as people become more secure about keeping their jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the case of the Phoenix portfolio, Mr. Liu gained scale with relatively little cash down. Mr. Liu paid about $13 million in cash and assumed roughly $120 million in debt that had been restructured as part of the sale, according to Mark Forrester, a partner with Hendricks &amp; Partners, a multifamily real-estate investment-banking company hired to assist with the sale. Mr. Liu also put up hefty nonrefundable deposits of about $1.75 million, which helped make him the winning bidder, according to Bill Hoffman of Trigild Inc., the receiver that handled the sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By some measures, Mr. Liu got a pretty good bargain. Standard Portfolios paid about $48,000 a unit, well below the $78,000 that the 2,759 units last sold for in 2007, according to Trigild.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The purchase followed Standard Portfolios' $296 million acquisition earlier this year of about 16 apartment complexes in Texas and Maryland, also owned previously by an affiliate of Bethany Group, according to Real Capital. Additionally, Standard Portfolios paid an undisclosed price for a Florida apartment complex.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts are watching to see when more Chinese banks and institutions will follow investors like Mr. Liu. "They're sitting on a lot of capital," says Jacques Gordon, a global strategist for <span class="companylink">LaSalle Investment Management</span> in Chicago.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese investment in U.S. real estate is becoming more than meets the eye because of investors like David Liu.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Liu, who was born in China and is a U.S. citizen, has emerged out of nowhere to become one of the largest buyers of rental apartment buildings in the U.S. this year, paying roughly $480 million for about 8,000 units. In his most recent deal, his company, Standard Portfolios, paid about $133 million in cash and assumed debt for seven Phoenix-area apartment complexes previously owned by Bethany Group of Irvine, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Liu's money comes from profits from his ventures in China, where he has condominiums and other commercial real-estate projects in such cities as Beijing, according to Mark Osgood, Mr. Liu's U.S. adviser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Mr. Liu's deals aren't counted when market-data companies like <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span> record foreign investment because Standard Portfolios is based in California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Counting only those investors based in China, there has been just $62.6 million of Chinese investment in the U.S. commercial-real-estate list this year, putting China 12th in a ranking of countries. By comparison, Canada was the top source of foreign investment in U.S. real estate this year, with about $1.8 billion invested through August, according to Real Capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But other forms of Chinese investment clearly are on the rise as that country's economic engine generates billions of dollars of surplus cash looking for opportunities. For example, China's sovereign-wealth fund, <span class="companylink">China Investment Corp</span>., has been exploring buying stakes in U.S.-focused real-estate funds. These investments also wouldn't be counted by Real Capital because CIC wouldn't be buying property directly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a lot of foreign money coming in through intermediaries, so it's not showing up in these numbers," says Ben Carlos Thypin, a senior market analyst with Real Capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Liu declined to be interviewed for this article. But others who have worked with him say his two largest deals demonstrate that he has both the patience needed to wade through the details of distressed assets and the capital needed to convince sellers that he is serious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Liu founded Standard late last year and soon began amassing U.S. apartments, according to Mr. Osgood. Mr. Liu's U.S. real-estate investments had been limited to some raw land. In his 50s, Mr. Liu has had a home in the U.S. for the past decade or so, Mr. Osgood says. He divides his time between Beijing and the home that he shares with his wife outside Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Liu expects recent high foreclosure rates to push more tenants into the rental market and help stabilize property in even the most battered regions like Phoenix. Mr. Liu is looking to continue to make other similar acquisitions, particularly in the Western U.S., Mr. Osgood says. "He wants scale," Mr. Osgood says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the case of the Phoenix portfolio, Mr. Liu gained scale with relatively little cash down. Mr. Liu paid about $13 million and assumed roughly $120 million in debt that had been restructured as part of the sale, according to Mark Forrester, a partner with Hendricks &amp; Partners, a multifamily real-estate investment-banking company hired to assist with the sale. Mr. Liu also put up nonrefundable deposits of $1.75 million, which helped make him the winning bidder, according to Bill Hoffman of Trigild Inc., the receiver that handled the sale.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For more than 300 years, a huge swath of land in what is now New Mexico endured the rise and fall of empires, the arrival of settlers and development of the surrounding area into the city of Albuquerque.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Atrisco Land Grant, handed down by Spain's king and queen in 1703, has never seen anything like the real-estate disaster now gripping hedge-fund firm <span class="companylink">D.E. Shaw &amp; Co</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Known for its obsession with computer-driven investing, the New York company surprised many real-estate deal makers in late 2006 by teaming up with developer SunCal Cos. to buy the 55,000-acre property -- twice the size of Boston -- for $250 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two companies planned to create a new town with residential, commercial and industrial areas. But the nationwide real-estate slump left the project stuck on the drawing board. Last month, lenders led by U.K. bank <span class="companylink">Barclays PLC</span> foreclosed on the property. D.E. Shaw and SunCal have only a few weeks to come up with the money needed to pay off the lenders, or else the hedge-fund firm could see its roughly $100 million investment wiped out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal is the largest potential loss facing D.E. Shaw in its wider, ill-fated move into real estate. The firm had invested about $2 billion in real estate near or at the height of the market, according to people familiar with the matter. It also realized profits from selling a number of properties such as 340 Madison Ave. in New York. Its remaining $1 billion real-estate book is marked at around $700 million today, the people said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real-estate performance contributed to the firm's recent decision to reassess its businesses, which also include distressed and event-driven investing. One of the largest hedge-fund firms, D.E. Shaw is cutting 150 jobs, or 10% of its work force, after seeing its assets under management decline to about $20 billion from nearly $40 billion two years ago, people familiar with the figures say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While our existing team remains focused on optimizing and supporting the firm's real-estate portfolio, we are not currently investing in new deals out of our absolute-return strategies," said George Rizk, head of real estate at D.E. Shaw</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pain shows how little the quantitative trading strategies used by D.E. Shaw to move quickly in and out of many investments helped the hedge-fund firm as it made big bets on illiquid real-estate development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">D.E. Shaw is known primarily for its expertise in a form of trading that uses mathematical models to predict markets. Real estate traditionally represents less than 5% of the firm's business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Founded in 1988 by David Shaw, a former Columbia University computer-science faculty member, the firm uses complicated programs to buy and sell assets, often stocks and bonds, trying to predict their rise or fall based on historical patterns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast, real estate is a slow-moving, capital-intensive investment that requires extensive fundamental analysis of property values, cash flow and other factors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Atrisco investment was structured to pay off over a 20-year period -- an eternity in the quant world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When capital markets seized up and the project bogged down, D.E. Shaw couldn't escape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adversity is nothing new for the dry and rocky Atrisco tract. The area was settled in the late 1500s by a band of families led by Juan de Onate, one of the last of the Spanish conquistadors. Apache attacks were so frequent that women commonly walked behind men with guns as they plowed their fields, according to Peter Sanchez, chief executive of the Atrisco Heritage Foundation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a reward for their perseverance, the 12 principal families were given an 80,000-acre grant by Spain. The families and their heirs held on even as the control was passed from Spain to Mexico to the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Development and land sales whittled down the size of the area to 55,000 acres. In the 1960s, the owners formed a land-owning corporation to manage development and preservation. In 2006, they voted to sell <span class="companylink">Westland Development Co</span>. to D.E. Shaw and closely held SunCal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The development plan called for selling 39,328 market-rate residential lots in 20 years and the remaining 36,000 acres in bulk. The two companies also planned to sell 3,391 acres of commercial land. But the projections depended on Albuquerque maintaining its strong growth rate. Growth slowed sharply after the recession hit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The venture also was hurt by a decision to make a long-term investment using short-term debt. To help finance the land purchase, D.E. Shaw and SunCal borrowed $212.3 million, planning to refinance in a few years. The short-term debt was originated by a <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> unit, which sold pieces to private-equity firm Five Mile Capital Partners LLC and <span class="companylink">iStar Financial Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The debt came due in June 2008 as financial markets were going into a tailspin. That set off a series of debt extensions and negotiations that culminated in April when the Atrisco venture sought bankruptcy protection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project's lenders contend that the filing was a "bad-faith" move by the partnership to avoid its obligations. A bankruptcy-court judge dismissed the case, and the land has been taken back by <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>, Five Mile and iStar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The D.E Shaw partnership has 30 days to come up with about $150 million to pay off the creditors and get the property back. SunCal also ran into trouble in 2008 when its biggest lender, <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc</span>., filed for bankruptcy, forcing SunCal to suspend work on 20 large residential property developments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sanchez says he hopes that D.E. Shaw and SunCal find a way to stay involved in the Atrisco project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They spent three years investing in engineering and infrastructure," he says. "They bought and paid for a lot of good intellectual property. They're in the greatest position to take advantage of it."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Robbie Whelan   </div><div>1238 words</div><div>11 October 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent suspensions of foreclosures by four major companies that service mortgages compound a problem that had existed for years in states where foreclosures are handled by the courts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 23 states in which foreclosures must be approved by a judge, the process takes longer than in states where courts are not involved, and some economists say it's among the factors delaying a housing rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One comparison widely cited: In California, where judges don't handle foreclosures, the housing market appears to have hit bottom a year ago and has been bouncing back. In Florida, where foreclosures go through the court system, prices keep falling, and foreclosure inventory continues to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>. announced it would suspend foreclosure sales in all 50 states. That follows the bank's earlier suspension of tens of thousands of foreclosures in the states that handle foreclosures through the court system, a move also taken by GMAC Home Mortgage, Inc., a unit of <span class="companylink">Ally Financial Inc</span>., and J.P. Mortgage Chase &amp; Co.'s home-loan unit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, several state attorneys general, as well as members of Congress, are calling for an across-the-board foreclosure moratorium on foreclosures to sort out alleged irregularities in foreclosure documents submitted by the banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Obama administration officials said such a move risked worsening the housing crisis because foreclosures account for such a large share of all home sales. "Stopping that process could have significant impacts on prolonging the housing recovery," said David Stevens, the commissioner of the Federal Housing Administration. Mr. Stevens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">White House adviser David Axelrod on Sunday questioned the need for a moratorium, saying that valid foreclosures with accurate documents should go ahead. "Our hope is this moves rapidly and that this gets unwound very, very quickly,'' he said on CBS's "Face the Nation"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Cordray, Ohio's attorney general, said Sunday that as many as 40 state attorneys general across the country intend to open an investigation of lenders and servicers to figure out the scope of the problems with foreclosure documents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it remains unclear how long the foreclosure process will be stalled, economists say any delay is bad for the housing market long-term. "Foreclosures are being delayed with good intentions, to protect consumers, but it's really just delaying the inevitable," says John Burns, a real estate consultant in Irvine,Calif. "They're delaying the eventual housing recovery."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report released last month by RealtyTrac, which tracks foreclosures, found that foreclosures sales amounted to an average of 24% of all home sales during the second quarter of this year, which totaled about 248,000 homes. In Nevada, one of several western states that was hard hit by the housing downturn, foreclosure sales comprised 56% of all sales activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Before all the bank suspensions and the robo-signers, we were headed for some big price declines in the fourth quarter. But now, in a place like Florida, in the short term, this will stabilize prices, because there won't be this bubble of supply hitting the market all at once," says Ivy Zelman, a housing analyst at Zelman &amp; Associates in Cleveland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While slowing foreclosures could have some positive benefits—stabilizing prices in the short term—economists argue that the vast majority of borrowers in trouble ultimately lose their homes, and the delays and interventions do more harm than good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Florida and California have led the nation in foreclosures since the housing crisis began and both saw average home prices drop more than 50% between 2007 and 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while the percentage of mortgages in foreclosures continues to rise in Florida, it is falling in California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Zandi, chief economist of <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics, said that price recoveries in states is closely tied to the length of the foreclosure process and has pressed for a standardization of foreclosure laws at the federal level to expedite the process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The judicial process isn't the only determining factor. California's economy is more diverse than Florida's and real estate, long term, has always been a stronger bet in California, which explains why buyers would pounce once prices declined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data prepared for The Wall Street Journal by LPS Analytics shows that the time it takes for a borrower to go through the foreclosure process nationally has steadily climbed in all states in the past five years, and now takes an average of 478 days, up from 302 days in early 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Florida, the average foreclosure now takes 573 days. In California, the average is 457 days, though many take less than 120 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're seeing a mess and we're seeing a process that takes anywhere from nine months on the short end to two or three years," said Peter Murphy, president of Tampa, Fla.-based Home Encounter LLC a realty firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says that in the last week, as the documents issue unfolded, he saw 15% of all foreclosure-sales listings of bank-owned homes yanked from the market. "I would expect that if we didn't have the judicial process, we'd be either right at the bottom, or we'd be bumping along the bottom getting ready to recover."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">　Consumer advocates say the judicial process gives consumers a better chance to work out their problems. But Florida's court system is so overwhelmed with foreclosures that last year it began calling judges out of retirement to handle hundreds of foreclosure cases a day in a forum that became known as the "rocket docket."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists argue the efforts are wasteful because in the large majority of cases, borrowers have already turned over the keys to the home and walked away from their loans. Others stopped paying because, they said, defaulting was the only way to get their lender to consider a loan modification.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matt Johnson, a 37-year old preacher and schoolteacher who now lives in Tampa, Fla., bought a $250,000 home in Gainesville at the height of the market in 2006. He defaulted three years later, hired a lawyer, failed to sell the house and hasn't made a mortgage payment in thirteen months. The home is vacant, awaiting repossession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In California, when a homeowner defaults, the lender sends a notice, then must wait 90 days before scheduling a trustee sale of the house. The trustee sale must occur at least 21 days after it is scheduled, meaning that the quickest California foreclosures can take 111 days after default.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Samuel Kuoha, a 63-year old retired police officer and karate instructor, lost his home in El Cajon, Calif., in less than four months after defaulting on the $450,000 mortgage, which he refinanced in 2004 into a subprime loan, with payments that reset from $2,800 to nearly $5,000 per month. He says instead of serving him with papers, about 100 days after he defaulted, a bank representative gave him 30 days notice to move out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Next thing we know, some guy walked up to the door, and told my wife that they now owned the home, that they had bought it on the courthouse stairs," he said. Mr. Kuoha has since moved to Arizona, where he rents a house from a friend.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Craig Karmin   </div><div>537 words</div><div>6 October 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A23</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leona Helmsley's 40-acre estate in Greenwich, Conn., was sold for $35 million, marked down substantially from its initial $125 million price tag but still among the most expensive homes ever sold in this affluent New York suburb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The transaction closed on Tuesday, according to Greenwich property records. The 1918 manor house, which has nearly 22,000 square feet and features a carriage house, walk-in vault and a koi pond, played a key part in Ms. Helmsley's federal tax-evasion conviction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1989, Ms. Helmsley and her husband, Harry, were accused of illegally billing their company for more than $3 million in renovations to the Greenwich estate. Ms. Helmsley was convicted and sentenced to 16 years in prison, though she served less than two. She died in August 2007 at 87 years old. Mr. Helmsley was deemed too ill to stand trial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Proceeds from the sale go to the Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust. She left the majority of her real estate and other holdings to the trust, estimated to be worth billions of dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trust also holds a stake in the Empire State Building, in a partnership with the Malkin family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trust has been putting property on the block lately and earlier this year sold the Carlton House, a prime Manhattan hotel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Helmsley also notoriously left $12 million to her dog, named Trouble, though a Manhattan court later reduced the Maltese's inheritance to $2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lyn Stevens of Greenwich Fine Properties, the listing agent, declined to comment. Officials from the Helmsley charitable trust didn't return calls for comment. The property was bought through a trust, say people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greenwich is famously home to numerous wealthy hedge-fund managers who have often purchased expensive homes, only to tear them down and build even more extravagant palaces in their place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Helmsley estate, also known as Dunnellen Hall, is one of the town's older homes. It doesn't enjoy beachfront status, and brokers said that the kitchen, bathrooms and other rooms would likely need renovation. But Dunnellen is still seen as one of the grandest residences in town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's at one of the highest points in Greenwich, with distant views of the Long Island sound," says Barbara Wells, a sales agent with Prudential Connecticut Realty. "In its day, it was considered one of the most luxurious homes around."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property was first listed in April 2008 for $125 million by Christie's Great Estates. The price was considered stratospheric even by Greenwich's lofty standards and was one of the highest-priced listings ever seen in the greater New York area. Earlier this year, Ms. Stevens acquired the estate listing, dropping the asking price to $55 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 28-room mansion lacks few amenities. It includes a reception hall with an 86-foot-long gallery, a master suite with an onyx bath and a wine cellar with tasting room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property was bought by the Helmsleys for $11 million in 1983. They spent an additional $8 million renovating the property, adding a $1 million dance floor.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Maura Webber Sadovi   </div><div>786 words</div><div>6 October 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the displeasure of disgraced financier R. Allen Stanford, more than a dozen properties once owned by companies affiliated with him are beginning to sell into a challenging market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest on the block: An airport hangar that could be used by corporate jets in Sugar Land Regional Airport outside Houston that is scheduled to be auctioned this week. The starting minimum bid will be about $1.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales are picking up steam despite the objections of Mr. Stanford, who faces civil and criminal charges and is awaiting trial in Houston's Federal Detention Center. They are coming roughly eight months after a federal judge approved the court-appointed receiver's plan to sell the properties and nearly two years after the Securities and Exchange Commission filed suit accusing Mr. Stanford and several executives and companies affiliated with Mr. Stanford of defrauding investors of billions of dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In court filings Mr. Stanford's attorneys have pointed out that Mr. Stanford's case has yet to be resolved and that it doesn't make sense for the properties to sell in a battered real-estate market. "It is difficult to imagine how liquidating the estate's interest in a depressed real-estate market and overall economic climate is consistent with the receiver's duty to preserve the value of the estate pending a final adjudication on the merits," Mr. Stanford's attorneys wrote in a July federal court filing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, attorneys for Ralph Janvey, the court-appointed receiver overseeing the sales with the assistance of the real-estate services firm <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>, stated in an earlier court filing that the receiver needed to sell the properties, "to carry out his obligation to preserve the assets and minimize expenses of the receivership estate."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers have picked up two of the most valuable assets already. A Florida attorney in July paid about $10.7 million for vacant land in an exclusive part of Coral Gables, Fla. Meanwhile, Dirk D. Laukien, founder of Black Forest Ventures in Texas, has agreed to pay about $12.2 million for a 71,000-square-foot office building that once acted as Mr. Stanford's Houston headquarters. The purchase of the building at 5050 Westheimer in Houston's upscale Galleria submarket hasn't yet closed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The portfolio also includes an eclectic collection of properties ranging from a condominium in Tennessee to vacant land and a retail property in St. Croix. While it isn't clear exactly how the companies came to own the specific properties, the SEC suit alleges that real-estate played a role in Mr. Stanford's troubles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The SEC suit filed in 2009 alleged that Stanford International Bank sold certificates of deposit to investors and assured purchasers that their deposits were safe, in part because the banks primarily invested in liquid financial instruments. "Instead, a substantial portion of the bank's portfolio was placed in illiquid investments such as real estate and private equity," the SEC alleged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the deals so far, the receiver hasn't exactly raked in the cash. For example, all but about $3 million of the $12 million in proceeds from the sale of the Stanford building in Houston will go to pay off the mortgage, as well as default interest on it, according to Kevin Sadler, an attorney for the receiver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, while values have recovered some in many markets, they are still well off boom-year highs. The three-story Stanford building, which once featured a multimedia theater for client presentations and a half floor of private offices for Mr. Stanford, went for $171 a square foot. While that is above the $100 range that some Houston office buildings sell for, the poshly appointed property might have fetched between $200 and $225 a square foot before the financial downturn, according to Tom Fish, a real-estate investment banker with <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> in Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property sold in Coral Gables drew more interest. The land is located in Gables Estates, a community originally developed in the early 1960s by industrialist Arthur Vining Davis and encompassing 192 lots with, "wide, deep water and sea-walled canals which wind their way through magnificent estate homes," according to the Gables Estates website. Jeffrey E. Lehrman, the buyer of the Florida property, said he paid about $10.7 million, above the $9.3 million minimum bid and Mr. Lehrman still believes he got a good deal. He estimates the rare slice of undeveloped land in the posh community would have fetched as much as $17 million at the peak of the market.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a sign of accelerating consolidation among property-management companies, <span class="companylink">Rockefeller Group International</span> is considering further acquisitions in Europe after announcing a deal this week to take a controlling stake in Europa Capital LLP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Europa deal creates a business that manages about $20 billion of real-estate investments and fills a gap in Rockefeller Group's global ambitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are looking to build out Europe," Kevin Hackett, chief executive of Rockefeller Group, told The Wall Street Journal in an interview. "Acquisitions are something we are intensely interested in, and if the right opportunity comes along we will pursue it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hackett said final negotiations to acquire 75% of Europa Capital in an all-cash transaction are expected to close by Oct. 14. No further financial details were disclosed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The acquisition by Rockefeller, which has its roots in the company that developed Rockefeller Center in New York City, comes amid signs that rising corporate deal making in Europe is spilling over into the property sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overall volume of takeovers in Europe rose 19% in the third quarter from the same period a year ago to $205.5 billion, according to Dealogic. The research firm added that investment bankers were increasingly confident that a three-year freeze on deals is beginning to thaw.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the property-management space, a number of large banks have sold such businesses as they move to reduce their exposure to the real-estate sector. <span class="companylink">ING Groep</span>, the Dutch financial-services giant, is considering selling its real-estate unit ING Real Estate, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other banks see the sales as an opportunity to broaden their real-estate business. <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span>'s Real Estate Property Management International, the property unit of the French bank, announced last week that it was acquiring three property-management subsidiaries of <span class="companylink">AEW Europe</span>, a unit of <span class="companylink">AEW Capital Management</span>, in Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rockefeller Group's acquisition of a controlling stake in Europa marks the start of its major push into European real estate. "The last piece of the foundation was Europe," Rockefeller's Mr. Hackett said. "We have been looking for the right candidate for a long time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rockefeller Group, which is owned by <span class="companylink">Mitsubishi Estate Co</span>. of Japan, lost control of Rockefeller Center in 1996. Since then it has been focusing on its development, money-management and other businesses. Mitsubishi's international business, which is largely accounted for by Rockefeller Group, generated $481.5 million of revenue and $126 million in operating profit in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Europa is a European private-equity property fund manager that has invested more than 6 billion euros ($8 billion) in 17 European countries since 1995 through six property funds. The London-based fund manager has about 2 billion euros of European assets under management and is currently using money raised for a third regional fund to invest in European property. It has another new fund targeting real estate in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Europa is part of a consortium with <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank AG</span>'s RREEF Europe unit and Area Property Partners that acquired two major portfolios of property assets from <span class="companylink">Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria</span> in 2009 and 2010 in a 1.5 billion euros sale-and-lease back transaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, Europa acquired car maker Renault's convention center in Boulogne-Billancourt, a suburb of Paris, for its Europa Fund III.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building faces the Seine river and is leased back to Renault, which has its headquarters in the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Europa's focus has been more as an opportunity investor, but of late the fund has been broadening its strategy to include investment with less-risk, so-called core investments, in mature markets such as Germany.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leona Helmsley's 40-acre estate in Greenwich, Conn., was sold for $35 million, marked down substantially from its initial $125 million price tag but still among the most expensive homes ever sold in this affluent New York suburb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The transaction closed on Tuesday, according to Greenwich property records. The 1918 manor house, which has nearly 22,000 square feet and features a carriage house, walk-in vault and a koi pond, played a key part in Ms. Helmsley's federal tax-evasion conviction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1989, Ms. Helmsley and her husband, Harry, were accused of illegally billing their company for more than $3 million in renovations to the Greenwich estate. Ms. Helmsley was convicted and sentenced to 16 years in prison, though she served less than two. She died in August 2007 at 87 years old. Mr. Helmsley was deemed too ill to stand trial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Proceeds from the sale go to the Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust. She left the majority of her real estate and other holdings to the trust, estimated to be worth billions of dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trust also holds a stake in the Empire State Building, in a partnership with the Malkin family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trust has been putting property on the block lately and earlier this year sold the Carlton House, a prime Manhattan hotel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Helmsley also notoriously left $12 million to her dog, named Trouble, though a Manhattan court later reduced the Maltese's inheritance to $2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lyn Stevens of Greenwich Fine Properties, the listing agent, declined to comment. Officials from the Helmsley charitable trust didn't return calls for comment. The property was bought through a trust, say people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greenwich is famously home to numerous wealthy hedge-fund managers who have often purchased expensive homes, only to tear them down and build even more extravagant palaces in their place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Helmsley estate, also known as Dunnellen Hall, is one of the town's older homes. It doesn't enjoy beachfront status, and brokers said that the kitchen, bathrooms and other rooms would likely need renovation. But Dunnellen is still seen as one of the grandest residences in town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's at one of the highest points in Greenwich, with distant views of the Long Island sound," says Barbara Wells, a sales agent with Prudential Connecticut Realty. "In its day, it was considered one of the most luxurious homes around."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property was first listed in April 2008 for $125 million by Christie's Great Estates. The price was considered stratospheric even by Greenwich's lofty standards and was one of the highest-priced listings ever seen in the greater New York area. Earlier this year, Ms. Stevens acquired the estate listing, dropping the asking price to $55 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 28-room mansion lacks few amenities. It includes a reception hall with an 86-foot-long gallery, a master suite with an onyx bath and a wine cellar with tasting room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property was bought by the Helmsleys for $11 million in 1983. They spent an additional $8 million renovating the property, adding a $1 million dance floor.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Signs of Recovery For Office Market</span>
</div><div class="author">By Anton Troianovski   </div><div>1042 words</div><div>5 October 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a sign that the country's commercial real-estate market is finally turning the corner, new statistics show that office rents that have been falling throughout the economic downturn are beginning to stabilize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The industry's recovery is likely to be a slow one. Many businesses are continuing to give up office space as new hiring stays sluggish, the timing of the economy's recovery remains uncertain and companies figure out how to fit more workers into less space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors are taking action. In the latest deal, publicly traded landlord <span class="companylink">Boston Properties Inc</span>., run by real-estate and media mogul Mortimer Zuckerman, on Monday said it would buy Boston's tallest skyscraper, the John Hancock Tower, for $930 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial real estate, an enormous sector with some $1.4 trillion of debt coming due by the end of 2014, has been closely watched by regulators and financial companies because it could act as an anchor on the economy as it struggles to recover. For months the news has been bad, with declining rents and rising vacancies pushing more properties into default, foreclosure and bankruptcy. Thousands of landlords are struggling with properties valued at less than their mortgages, like millions of "underwater" homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pressure on rents now seems to be easing. Average effective rents—taking into account concessions such as a few months of free rent—for some 4 billion square feet of office space tracked by research firm <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>. fell by just a penny in the last three months, the smallest quarterly decline since 2008. At $22.05 per square foot per year, effective rents are 12% below the 2008 high of $25.07.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cities, the improvement has been much better. In New York, for example, where rents plummeted 19% in 2009, they were up 0.2% to $43.75, in the most recent quarter, according to Reis. Washington, D.C., remains the nation's healthiest office market, with a vacancy rate of 9.8%. One of the biggest leases of the quarter: the Securities and Exchange Commission's deal to occupy 900,000 square feet of space just south of the National Mall at a starting rate of $44.80 per square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rents continue to fall in many areas hit hard by the housing bust, including Phoenix, Las Vegas and San Diego.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another sign that the bottom is near, the increase in the national vacancy rate in each of the past two quarters was smaller than quarterly changes throughout 2009. Reis economists said the vacancy rate is now unlikely to reach the 1992 high of 18.7%. At the time, the commercial-real-estate industry was reeling from massive oversupply. "If we're not at the stabilization point, we're getting close," Reis economist Ryan Severino said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With rents stabilizing, investors have started to become more active in buying property, such as the Hancock tower, which creditors bought out of foreclosure and then sold to Boston Properties. The purchase price of that property is still far off the roughly $1.3 billion for which it sold during the boom. But in prime markets like Boston, prices have bounced back from their lows of the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The best buildings not only do well when everybody does well, but they do relatively better when everybody doesn't do well," said Mr. Zuckerman, the Boston Properties chief executive, in an interview. "Rents have gone down across the board, but that inspires a lot of companies to go into the best buildings, which they now feel they can afford."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All told, office buildings in 79 metropolitan areas tracked by Reis lost 1.9 million square feet of occupied space in the third quarter, pushing the national office vacancy rate to 17.5%, the highest level since 1993.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The turmoil hitting commercial real estate is the worst since the early 1990s, when the sector helped drag the economy into recession largely due to overbuilding. This time around, the problem is demand. Millions of job losses have eliminated the need for hundreds of millions of square feet of office space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the 135 million square feet of space that businesses have already given up, many offices around the country are filled with the vacant desks of laid-off workers. That means that even when companies start hiring again, they won't need more office space right away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another factor in what's likely to be a slow recovery: changes in workplace design that require far fewer square feet of office space per employee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In San Francisco, for example, accounting giant Deloitte recently inked a deal that reduces the square footage of its San Francisco headquarters by about 40%, even though the company plans to expand its head count in the city by 10% over the next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commercial real estate sector includes roughly $6 trillion worth of office buildings, stores, hotels, rental apartments and other properties. Other property types besides office also have shown signs of stability in recent months, thanks to such things as increasing business travel and growing demand for apartments. Retail sales are slowly rising, which means malls could recover as retailers' renewed leases reflect higher sales and retailers begin opening additional stores. But mall vacancies, as of the second quarter, were at their highest point—9%—in the 10 years that Reis has tracked the figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's much pain still to come. A mountain of commercial real estate debt sliced and diced on Wall Street during the boom is scheduled to come due in the coming years. The delinquency rate for those commercial-mortgage-backed securities topped 9% for the first time last week, research firm Trepp LLC said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lodging sector is the hardest hit, with a delinquency rate of 19.3%. Industrial property, which is benefiting from the pickup in global trade, has the lowest delinquency rate, 6.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several metropolitan areas in the nation's midsection continued to be pummeled by weakening demand for space. Chattanooga, Tenn.; Dayton, Ohio; and Tulsa, Okla., all saw vacancy-rate increases of one percentage point or more in the third quarter.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's crunch time for Aby Rosen, the real estate developer known for blending his properties with his flashy style and world-class art collection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rosen is negotiating an end to his partnership in the Gramercy Park Hotel with hotelier Ian Schrager, who transformed the century-old hotel with a redesign that includes contemporary artworks by artists such as Andy Warhol and Damien Hirst. In his battle to hold onto the boutique hotel, Mr. Rosen also is buying back a $140 million loan on the building from <span class="companylink">Union Labor Life Insurance</span> for about $90 million, people with knowledge of the situation say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few miles uptown, Mr. Rosen is at risk of losing the property at 66 East 55th Street that houses the Core Club, an exclusive social club whose initial members included Stephen Schwarzman, co-founder of the <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span> and the late Bruce Wasserstein, former head of <span class="companylink">Lazard Ltd</span>. An $18 million loan backed by some 27,439-square-foot retail condominium space at the building has been in default since early last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the lender has hired Mission Capital Advisors to sell the loan, according to people familiar with the matter. Bids are due on Oct. 26. Some prominent real-estate families have expressed interest in buying the debt with the intention of owning the property, the people said. Mr. Rosen declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like most developers who piled on easy credit during the boom years, Mr. Rosen has been scrambling to shore up his empire since the recession hit. These latest deals are a sign that these efforts by Mr. Rosen and others are moving into the end game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently, lenders generally have been reluctant to foreclose on property even after borrowers defaulted because values were scraping bottom and the lack of financing made it virtually impossible to sell. But now, a growing number of lenders holding debt on troubled projects are resorting to selling the debt to opportunistic investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders are betting that now is the time to sell because values have rebounded some and demand is increasing from investors who amassed large war chests of capital to go after troubled real estate. "With property values stabilizing, lenders have become more willing to sell," says Will Sledge, a managing director at Mission Capital. "Buyers, feeling the wind is at their back, are now more willing to incrementally increase the amount they'll pay for soured loans as a new way to get distressed real estate."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far this year, the New York-based loan-sale adviser had sold $3.4 billion of commercial property loans nationwide, compared to a total of $2.9 billion for all of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another example of aggressive investors looking to own property by snapping up debt, scores of hotel buyers and private-equity funds are circling the W Hotel and condo tower downtown currently owned by developer Joe Moinian, according to people familiar with the matter. The lender is marketing a $25 million junior loan on the property, also through Mission Capital, with bids due on Thursday. The sale of the debt would set the stage for a battle between Mr. Moinian and the potential buyer for control of the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokeswoman for Mr. Moinian declined to comment. The 56-year-old Iranian-born developer, who went on a buying spree during the boom years, also is fighting to fend off a foreclosure attempt aimed at an office tower near Columbus Circle by a venture led by Stephen Ross's Related Cos. and <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank AG</span>. The venture recently bought at close to full face value of the $250 million mortgage on the tower at 1775 Broadway and is now seeking to foreclose on the 700,000-square-foot building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers such as Messrs. Moinian and Rosen can fend off these opportunistic investors by paying off or buying back debt. But often, that is a challenging task because capital still remains difficult to come by.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rosen, the son of Holocaust survivors, founded his company, <span class="companylink">RFR Holding LLC</span>, with his childhood friend Michael Fuchs in the wake of the last real-estate crash of the late 1980s. The company has since built up a vast portfolio consisting largely of prime assets such as the iconic Seagram Building and Lever House. His extensive art collection includes works by Andy Warhol, Keith Haring and Jeff Koons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What makes Mr. Rosen stand out in the crowded Manhattan real-estate scene is his penchant for art and ability to weave his flashy style into his property holdings. At the members-only Core Club, which occupies the first five stories of the building at 66 E. 55th St., there is an art gallery, a Tom Colicchio restaurant, a fitness center, private concierges and meeting spaces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rosen teamed up with Mr. Schrager, his long-time friend and a co-founder of Studio 54, in acquiring the Gramercy Park Hotel in 2003. The 185-room hotel, which overlooks the private Gramercy Park, features an extensive collection of modern art and has won kudos for its design. But the ownership defaulted on the $140 million loan on the property this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Mr. Rosen is buying back the debt at a discount of about 35%. He's also close to buying out Mr. Schrager, who's focusing on creating new hotel brands.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jeff Bater                And Darrell A. Hughes   </div><div>569 words</div><div>4 October 2010</div><div>11:25</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. factory orders dropped more than expected in August, marking the third decline in the last four months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the National Association of Realtors' index for pending sales of used homes increased 4.3% to 82.3, the industry group said Monday. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had expected pending home sales would increase 3.8% in August. Year over year, the pending sales index was 20.1% below its level of 103 in August 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. manufactured goods orders decreased by 0.5% to $408.94 billion, the Commerce Department said Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial airplanes drove the decline; excluding transportation, all other factory orders rose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report had positive data. A barometer of business capital spending increased; non-defense capital goods orders excluding airplanes rose by 5.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had expected overall factory orders would decrease by 0.4% in August. July orders rose 0.5%, revised from a previously reported 0.1% increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signs of slowing in the U.S. manufacturing sector have been surfacing. The Institute for Supply Management's latest monthly gauge for the industry slowed in September, to 54.4 from 56.3 in August. Even though index remains above 50, which signals growth in the manufacturing sector, Capital Economics analyst Paul Ashworth said "the manufacturing recovery has clearly lost a lot of momentum since the spring."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Factory orders are either durable or non-durable. Durables are designed to last at least three years -- things such as cars. The Commerce report Monday said durables dropped by 1.5%, revised from a previously reported 1.3% decrease. Nondurables rose by 0.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Capital goods orders fell 0.1%. Non-defense capital goods orders rose 0.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, defense-related capital goods dropped by 1.8%. Excluding defense, all other factory orders decreased 0.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among industries, orders rose for electrical equipment, machinery, and computers. Demand fell for primary metals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transportation equipment fell 10.2% as orders for cars and commercial airplanes dropped. Orders for manufactured goods excluding transportation rose 0.9%. This was the first increase in the last five months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturers' inventories were up by 0.1% in August, after increasing 0.9% in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shipments declined 0.6%. Unfilled orders, a sign of future demand, were flat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending Home Sales Rise</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending home sales plummeted in May after the expiration of a government tax credit program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Attractive affordability conditions from very low mortgage interest rates appear to be bringing buyers back to the market," NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said. "However, the pace of a home sales recovery still depends more on job creation and an accompanying rise in consumer confidence."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR also revised its July figure to 78.9 from 79.4.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR index is based on pending sales of existing homes, including single-family homes and condominiums. A home sale is pending when the contract has been signed but the transaction hasn't closed. Pending sales typically close within one or two months of signing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regionally, the NAR's pending home sales index in August declined 2.9% to 60.6 in the Northeast, rose 2.1% to 68.0 in the Midwest, increased 6.7% to 90.8 in the South and rose 6.4% to 101.1 in the West.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Conor Dougherty and Sudeep Reddy   </div><div>432 words</div><div>2 October 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economic recovery is largely stuck in neutral, reports on manufacturing, construction and spending showed Friday, and the president of the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of New York</span> gave the clearest signal yet that the Fed was preparing new actions aimed at boosting growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. manufacturing expanded for the 14th-straight month in September, but growth continues to slow amid weakening demand. The Institute for Supply Management's index of manufacturing activity fell 1.9 percentage points to 54.4, the group said Friday. Any number over 50 indicates expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're looking for the consumer situation to improve, or something to drive demand, because it's obvious that demand is slowing," said Norbert Ore, chairman of the group's survey committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a speech Friday before the Society of American Business Editors and Writers, New York Fed President William Dudley indicated that the Fed, confronted with "unacceptable" conditions of high unemployment and low inflation, is likely to take new action to support the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With interest rates sitting near zero, Fed officials are discussing whether to restart bond purchases to push down long-term borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. The Fed bought $1.7 trillion in mortgage and Treasury securities, and is now reinvesting the proceeds to keep its balance sheet stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dudley said $500 billion in additional asset purchases would provide stimulus equivalent to a reduction of 0.5 to 0.75 percentage point in the federal funds rate, the Fed's typical lever for stimulating the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report Friday showed consumer spending rose 0.4% in August, the same rise as a month earlier. Personal incomes increased 0.5%, but have been flat two months in a row when government payments like Social Security are excluded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The savings rate -- money left over after taxes and spending -- was 5.8% in August, up slightly from July. Savings, though good for the long-term health of the economy, are a drag in the short term, because they deprive the economy of much-needed demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers are feeling a little less glum about the economic outlook. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment index rose to 68.2 in September from 66.6 earlier in the month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government help was behind a boost in spending on construction projects, which rose 0.4% in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $811.83 billion, compared with July, the Commerce Department said Friday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Carmel Valley, Calif., ranch for sale by NationsRent founder Jim Kirk is 6,500 acres. A Friday Journal article on high-end residential real-estate incorrectly said the ranch was 600 acres.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(WSJ Oct. 2, 2010)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than four years after the housing market peaked, many of the nation's wealthiest homeowners are slashing prices in earnest. The asking price on the late Brooke Astor's Park Avenue duplex has plummeted to $24.9 million from $46 million. Thursday Peter Sperling, son of the University of Phoenix founder John Sperling, dropped the price on his San Francisco limestone mansion to $47 million; he had been asking $65 million since 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there are the ultimate holdouts: a rarefied slice of extremely wealthy sellers who are holding the line on today's deal-making, price-slashing mentality. Even as their properties have lingered on the market, these sellers haven't budged on initial asking prices, some of which were set in the waning days of the housing bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suzanne Saperstein, ex-wife of <span class="companylink">Metro Networks</span> founder David Saperstein, is still asking $125 million for "Fleur de Lys," a 41,000-square-foot, French chateau-inspired mansion near Beverly Hills with gold-embossed leather wall coverings and a ballroom. The listing has been on the market since at least April 2007, a month when the Dow passed 13,000. Mr. Saperstein has an equestrian estate that's been asking $75 million since at least August 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also sitting on the market is the 600-acre Carmel Valley, Calif., ranch owned by Jim Kirk, who founded rental equipment company NationsRent, which sold for $600 million in 2006. Purchased for about $10 million after a five-year search, the property -- with a four-bedroom main house, hiking trails and other structures -- has been listed at $33 million since November 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With housing prices off about 28% from their peak in 2006 according to <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller Index, some real estate agents say waiting is a risky strategy. "Everyone, from bottom to top, got hurt in the financial panic, and it's reflected in the high-end of the housing market being frozen," says Mark Zandi, chief economist of <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics. He adds that price declines, originally confined to the bottom of the market, have begun migrating upward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've never been in a more price-sensitive market," says Janet Owen of Sudler Sotheby's International Realty, who recently got the listing for the Chicago mansion of <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span>'s Jamie Dimon. Originally listed for $13.5 million in 2007, the home as of August was listed at $6.95 million. It went into contract in late September. "The smart sellers respond to the market," Ms. Owen says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some holdouts and their brokers defend their prices, arguing that their estates would be difficult, if not impossible, to replicate today. "I feel the property is worth every penny -- and probably then some," says Tommy Hilfiger co-founder Joel Horowitz, who has been asking $100 million for his 210-acre estate in Zephyr Cove, Nev., since July 2006, when the National Association of Realtors' then-Chief Economist David Lereah said that housing appeared to be headed for a soft landing in most markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Horowitz notes that he and his wife Ann spent a year designing the home and three years building it and bought items for the home on their travels before it was even built -- including lighting fixtures, fireplace mantels and 400-year-old flooring from French chateaux.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others point to recent mega-deals, saying it's simply a matter of finding that one right buyer. London developers Nick and Christian Candy in September reportedly sold their Monaco penthouse for nearly GBP 200 million (about $314.3 million), believed to be one of the most expensive residential real-estate deals in the world. Since buyers can be expected to come in with lowball offers, cutting the asking price would be akin to negotiating with yourself, says former New York Giants running back Tucker Frederickson who, with a partner, has been asking for $50 million for a 5,000-acre cattle-and-shooting ranch in Florida since 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With unemployment hovering over 9%, such lavish, some consider over-the top houses out of sync with the national mood. "Do you really want to be rubbing it in people's faces when they've been searching for work for 18 months?," asks Cornell University economics professor Robert H. Frank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While many home sellers can be slow to adjust to the market, the very wealthy can be the slowest of all. "That stratum of the population is not impervious to what's happening in the market, but they operate by their own set of dynamics," says Sam Khater, senior economist at real-estate research firm <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, it's a rule of thumb that the longer a listing lingers, the less desirable it often seems to buyers. For some of these holdouts, brokers have masked length of time "on market" by avoiding officially listing them or yanking them on and off multiple-listing services. Instead, properties are marketed on brokers' own Web sites, by word of mouth or through targeted mailings. Candy Spelling's "The Manor" in Los Angeles officially hit the market in March 2009, for example, but was shown in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drew Mandile of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>, who represents Mr. Saperstein's equestrian estate, says he and his colleague "go dumb" any time a prospective buyer asks how long the property has been for sale. A response could invite fruitless inquires about how low a buyer could bid. "Do you think a seller has ever told a broker how much he would ever take?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">$75 million since August 2007</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Simi Valley, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seller: <span class="companylink">Metro Networks</span> founder David Saperstein</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Specs: The Sapersteins bought the roughly 125-acre equestrian estate in the 1990s and built a roughly 15,000-square-foot, Mission-style house. They also built five guest houses and 10 factory-built homes for staff -- totaling 59 bedrooms. There's a barn with individually heated stalls, three arenas, parking for 500 cars and a helipad. Drew Mandile and Brooke Knapp of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span> shared the listing with Joyce Rey of Coldwell Banker Previews International.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comparison Shopping: El Campeon Farms, a 158-acre equestrian estate in Hidden Valley with a 4,500-square-foot house, is asking $35 million, down from the original $50 million asking price earlier this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Priced to Sell? It's a rare property, says Pat Evans of Coldwell Banker, but a sales price of under $40 million is more realistic. The brokers say the property can't be replicated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">$100 million since July 2006</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zephyr Cove, Nev.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seller: Tommy Hilfiger co-founder Joel Horowitz</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Specs: Mr. Horowitz and his wife Ann built "Tranquility," a stone mansion on 210 acres. The home includes five bedrooms and a lounge inspired by one in New York's St. Regis Hotel. Art and furnishings are included. There's a staircase modeled on the Titanic, a putting green, a gym with an indoor basketball court, an art studio, an indoor pool and spa and a boat house. Total square footage including the mansion and other structures is more than 38,000 square feet. "I am in no rush to sell," says Mr. Horowitz, adding that he and his wife are downsizing to spend more time with their children and grandchildren on the East Coast. Shari Chase and Susan Lowe of Chase International share the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comparison Shopping: A 4.35-acre property with three homes and a 12,000-square-foot garage in Incline Village, with about 300 feet of frontage on Lake Tahoe, was asking $65 million in 2007; it is now asking $50 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Priced to Sell? While the property does have a private lake, it does not have frontage on Lake Tahoe, notes local broker Jean Merkelbach with <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>, calling the price "aggressive" for today's market. "In that price point most people are going to want to be on the lake." Ms. Lowe says the property speaks for itself, adding that the property couldn't be built today for its asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">$150 million since 2008</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Los Angeles</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seller: Candy Spelling, widow of television producer Aaron Spelling</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Specs: Late television producer Aaron Spelling ("Charlie's Angels," "Beverly Hills 90210") and his wife bought the former estate of Bing Crosby in the early 1980s. They tore down the existing house and completed a new, 57,000-square-foot mansion in 1991. Known as "The Manor," the almost five-acre estate has been shown since 2008 and was officially listed in March 2009. There's a bowling alley, beauty salon and parking for 100 cars. Jeff Hyland and Rick Hilton of Hilton &amp; Hyland, a Christie's Great Estates affiliate, share the listing with Sally Forster Jones, of Coldwell Banker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comparison Shopping: Across the street, an 11,000-square-foot home on an acre, listed for $25 million in 2008, sold for $10.35 million in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Priced to Sell? Stephen Shapiro of Westside Estate Agency says chances of any property selling for that price in this market are slim. "They're waiting for the oil sheik or the Russian billionaire," Mr. Shapiro says. "You can wait the rest of your life for that." Listing agent Ms. Jones says she believes the comment is a case of sour grapes and says "it takes time to find someone who is the right buyer."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">$33 million since November 2006</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carmel Valley, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seller: Jim Kirk, founder and former CEO of NationsRent, a rental equipment company that sold for $600 million in 2006</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Specs: Mr. Kirk bought this 6,500-acre ranch in the early 1980s for around $10 million after searching for five years. There's a four-bedroom main house, a guest house, hiking trails, a swimming pool and staff housing. Mr. Kirk, 61, says his brokers, Bill McDavid of Hall and Hall and Pete Clark of Clark Co., say "it's just a matter of time" before it sells. Mr. Kirk says he's looking to downsize as his grandchildren are grown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comparison Shopping: There are only two other ranches in Carmel Valley of several thousand acres or more. Several miles away, a bank-owned ranch of 600 acres is available for $3.9 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Priced to Sell?: Doug Steiny of <span class="companylink">Keller Williams Realty</span> calls the ranch a rare, beautiful property but says the price is "out of line." "They're toys. People aren't buying toys like that anymore." "It only takes one" buyer, says Mr. McDavid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">$125 million since April 2007</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Los Angeles</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seller: Suzanne Saperstein, ex-wife of <span class="companylink">Metro Networks</span> founder David Saperstein</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Specs: A 41,000-square-foot estate built of French limestone with Italian marble walls. The home has gold-embossed leather wall coverings, a ballroom with ceiling frescoes and a screening room with seating for 50. There's also a guest house, pool house with a massage room and gym and staff housing. Records indicate the couple bought the more than 4 1/2-acre lot in the 1990s and spent years building the home, near Beverly Hills. Robert Kass of Hilton and Hyland and Joyce Rey of Coldwell Banker Previews International share the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comparison Shopping: Less than a mile away, on three acres in Holmby Hills, a roughly 10,500-square-foot mansion priced just-under $50 million in February chopped its asking price in July to $37.95 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Priced to Sell?: That much acreage in Holmby Hills is rare, says Myra Nourmand of Nourmand &amp; Associates. But the "in-your-face opulence" of the home feels dated. "It may be worth it, but how many people are ready today to live like that?," she asks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">. . . and one who caved</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Old Asking Price: $100 million in October, 2009</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Asking Price: $48 million since February</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charlottesville, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seller: Patricia Kluge, an ex-wife of the late Metromedia founder and billionaire John Kluge, whose communications empire included broadcast and cellphones</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Specs: The "Albemarle House" sits on 300 acres in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. The main house is a 45-room, neo-Georgian mansion of about 23,500 square feet, with eight bedrooms, a theater, card room and Islamic gallery. Michael Rankin of TTR Sotheby's International Realty has the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Priced to Sell? Murdoch Matheson with Frank Hardy says the estate is "beautifully built", but that properties priced at $2.5 million, let alone more than $30 million, are hard sales these days.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HONG KONG—Major Asian markets ended mostly down Thursday on reemerging economic worries about Europe and after a decline on Wall Street, with Japanese shares tumbling as the yen rallied against the U.S. dollar. <span class="companylink">Nintendo Co</span>. plunged after slashing its profit forecasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese shares rebounded to end sharply higher as property developers soared a day after Beijing introduced tightening measures that weren't as harsh as some feared. The measures were "somewhat weaker than what the market had expected," said Wu Jianxiong from Central China Securities. "The real-estate tax was the biggest worry, but there were no details about its implementation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Japan's Nikkei Stock Average fell 2%, extending losses in afternoon trade, with Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 falling 1.3%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index slipping 0.1% and China's Shanghai Composite gaining 1.7%. Hong Kong is closed Friday and Chinese markets are closed from Friday through next Thursday for the National Day holiday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese shares advanced though Beijing took more steps Wednesday to cool stubbornly high property prices, ordering banks to halt lending for third and subsequent home purchases and raising the minimum down payment for all first-time home buyers. The statement from the State Council, China's cabinet, also said the government aims to speed up a trial reform of a "real estate tax" now being carried out in some cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They have been using this [tax] as one of the means to dampen the property market, but they don't want to kill the market. So it's probably been held in reserve. It's a reminder for people not to get too enthusiastic," said Howard Gorges, vice chairman at South China Brokerages. "I think that the government likes to make people feel good about the stock market before they go on a holiday. So, I suspect there might be a little window-dressing in Shanghai," he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the mainland market, <span class="companylink">China Vanke</span> surged 7.6% and Poly Real Estate spiked 8.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the Hong Kong market took a different view of the measures, with China developers listed there dropping sharply. <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> noted in a report that they have rallied more than their mainland peers since mid-May. <span class="companylink">Shimao Property Holdings</span> fell 3% and <span class="companylink">China Resources Land</span> declined 4.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hong Kong-listed shares of <span class="companylink">Industrial &amp; Commercial Bank of China</span> dropped 3.2%, with <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> selling part of its stake in the mainland bank. A person familiar with the matter told Dow Jones Newswires Goldman raised $2.25 billion from the sale of 3.04 billion shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere in the region, South Korea's Kospi added 0.3%, Taiwan's Taiex ended little changed. In afternoon trading, India's Sensex slipped 0.2% and Indonesian shares were up 0.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were down 16 points in screen trade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Nintendo Co</span>. led the fall in Tokyo, slumping 10.2% after it said on Wednesday its highly anticipated 3DS hand-held videogame machine will miss the holiday-shopping season and slashed its profit forecasts for the year by more than half.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Tokyo Electric Power</span> shed 3.3% after it said it will raise up to $6.6 billion to finance massive energy-related capital outlays at home and abroad, in what would be the largest equity financing among Japanese nonfinancial companies this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Citizen Holdings</span> gained 0.2% on a Nikkei report that the watch maker's April-September group operating profit was expected to quadruple from a year earlier to around seven billion yen ($84.3 million).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Investors are still worried about the yen's strength, so they don't want to chase the market higher," said Hikaru Sato, senior technical analyst at Daiwa Securities Capital Markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial shares lost ground after the cost of insuring debt for consumer lenders <span class="companylink">Acom Co</span>. and Promise Co. rose sharply in the wake of peer Takefuji's bankruptcy-protection filing this week. <span class="companylink">Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group</span>, which backs Acom, dropped 3.7% and <span class="companylink">Sumitomo Mitsui Financial</span>, which backs Promise, fell 3.9%. Promise tumbled 6.4% and Acom dropped 3.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In South Korea, technology and transportation stocks helped to support the market. "Investors seem to be buying major stocks whose third-quarter earnings forecasts are strong," said Kim Jung-hoon at <span class="companylink">Korea Investment &amp; Securities</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Hynix Semiconductor</span> rose 1.4%, while <span class="companylink">Korean Air Lines Co</span>. added 2.1% and <span class="companylink">Korea Kumho Petrochemical</span> advanced 3.1%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sydney stock market was weighed by rising concern over sovereign-debt issues in Europe and the release of data that showed a drop in domestic hom-building approvals for August and weaker property prices in the nation's cities. Banks paced the fall, with <span class="companylink">Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group</span> shedding 1.9% and <span class="companylink">Westpac Banking Corp</span>. sliding 2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Concern over European banks and Ireland could be weighing on the market," said Peter Copeland, senior institutional trader at BBY in Sydney. Strikes have ground much of Spain to a halt as workers in Europe crank up protests against austerity measures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ratings agency <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Thursday downgraded Spain's sovereign rating to Aa1 from Aaa, with a stable outlook, citing a "considerable deterioration" in government finances and worsening debt affordability. Furthermore, the cost of supporting the Irish banking system will cause the government's budget deficit to rise to 32% of its gross domestic product this year, Finance Minister Brian Lenihen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere, New Zealand's NZX 50 fell 1.5% and Philippine shares ended 0.3% lower. By late afternoon, Singapore's Straits Times Index fell 0.3% and Thailand's SET Index rose 0.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the foreign-exchange markets, the yen resumed its climb as investors awaited U.S. indicators such as weekly jobless claims and the Chicago purchasing-managers' index. Masafumi Yamamoto, chief foreign-exchange strategist in Japan for Barclays Bank, said worse-than-expected U.S. data would boost speculation that the Federal Reserve may soon take additional quantitative easing measures, putting pressure on the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar was at 83.25 yen from 83.70 yen in late New York Wednesday, while the euro was at 113.34 yen from 114.07 yen. Against the dollar, the euro was at $1.3612 from $1.3630.</p>

JGB prices were supported by an unexpected fall in Japan's industrial production in August, as it strengthened the view that the Bank of Japan would soon loosen monetary policy further to support the economy. Industrial output slipped 0.3% on month in August, compared to a 1.1% increase forecast.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The office-vacancy rate in Rosslyn, Va., is one of the lowest in the Washington region, which may well be the healthiest office market in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, developer Anthony Westreich hasn't been able to secure a construction loan for a 35-story, $300 million office project on a prime piece of land in Rosslyn. But he says the partnership behind the project will break ground next month anyway and spend $30 million in cash to start construction—a risky bet on the local market and an illustration of just how hard it is to build a skyscraper these days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a bit of a cart-and-horse situation," says Mr. Westreich, chief executive of closely held New York and Washington landlord Monday Properties. "You have tenants saying, 'I don't want to commit to a lease in your building until I know the financing is there,' and lenders saying, 'I don't want to commit to financing your building until I know the tenants are there.' "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dearth of financing is forcing developers to get creative about ways to proceed with projects that have been languishing on the drawing board for years. During the boom, developers often were able to obtain financing for office-building or retail projects before signing tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But ever since the recession hit, the financing spigot has run dry. Steep losses on top-of-the-market deals and a drop in demand for space have put have builders on the sidelines, while many lenders are swamped with boom-time loans gone bad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outstanding construction loans backing office buildings, shopping malls and other kinds of commercial real estate fell to a total of $221 billion in the second quarter of 2010, down from a peak of $298 billion in early 2009, according to data firm Foresight Analytics. The portion of those loans 30 days or more past due is up to 15.6%, nearly four times the rate two years ago. The nationwide vacancy rate for office buildings reached 17.4% in the second quarter, the highest level since 1993, according to research firm <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I just don't see people taking risk," says Stephen Blank, who specializes in real-estate finance for the nonprofit Urban Land Institute. "Sure, people have short memories—but not that short."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lack of financing and demand are among the reasons the construction industry is still in the doldrums. The Associated General Contractors of America says 245 out of 337 metropolitan areas lost construction jobs in the 12-month period that ended in August, with the unemployment rate in the construction industry remaining at nearly twice the national average. Demand for design services is still declining, according to the American Institute of Architects' billings index—a sign that an uptick in new construction isn't expected in the next nine to 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some developers think all that gloom makes for opportunity, arguing that a lack of new construction means demand for state-of-the-art buildings could outstrip supply within a few years. In New York City, developer Douglas Durst is making the second bet of his career on constructing a major office building as much of the real-estate industry is still reeling from a downturn. He recently won a competition to invest about $100 million in the 1,776-foot-tall skyscraper being built by the <span class="companylink">Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</span> on the site of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the mid-1990s, Mr. Durst broke ground on a skyscraper in Times Square without having found any tenants and while many competitors were still struggling with the aftermath of the recession of the early 1990s. He secured an anchor tenant for the building, publisher Condé Nast, before it was completed in 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The theory in 1994 and now is that there are very few other buildings being built, and tenants always prefer a new building," Mr. Durst said in an interview. "The risk is that the downturn lasts longer and you come online with an empty building."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other developers of new projects have been looking beyond banks for financing. Extell Development Co. has started construction on a 1,000-foot-tall residential tower in Manhattan, thanks in part to financing from partners in the Middle East. Extell says it is still working to secure a bank construction loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers in Dallas were able to start a 42-story condominium project this summer after granting 100% ownership to the local pension fund financing the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside Washington, Monday Properties' Mr. West reich also hopes to complete his building at a time when little new office space is on the market. Monday Properties and its majority partner, the estate of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc</span>., will spend $30 million in cash on building infrastructure and a four-story, below-grade parking garage over the next 12 to 14 months. Monday Properties says starting construction will help persuade tenants and lenders to sign on. That will allow the building to be completed as early as in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project at 1812 North Moore St. in Rosslyn had been on hold for two years as the economy sputtered. Now, Mr. Westreich says he believes the timing is right, with his nine-building Rosslyn office portfolio 96% occupied and little construction being finished from 2011 to 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We think we're coming to the market at the exact right time," Mr. Westreich says. Monday Properties' tenants in Rosslyn include defense contractors <span class="companylink">Northrop Grumman Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Raytheon Co</span>., the U.S. State Department, and <span class="companylink">Allbritton Communications Co</span>., which owns several television stations and Politico, the Beltway news outlet.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Robbie Whelan   </div><div>1015 words</div><div>29 September 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real-estate bust has taken down hundreds of banks and property companies. In most cases, the executives of those companies haven't had to take personal financial hits. But Bruce Elieff could become a high-profile exception.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Elieff is chief executive of SunCal Cos., a large, closely held California land developer and home builder. The company ran into trouble in 2008 when its biggest lender, <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc</span>., filed for bankruptcy, forcing SunCal to suspend work on 20 large residential property developments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, if SunCal can't complete the projects soon or sell them to a new developer who can, Mr. Elieff could be personally on the hook for as much as $230 million. Lehman has said it intends to hold him to his guarantees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether and how much Mr. Elieff must pay will be determined by the outcome of the <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> bankruptcy liquidation. Lehman says Mr. Elieff is liable, but he said in an interview he is confident Lehman would ultimately be held responsible for paying the obligations. Mr. Elieff's lawyer Louis "Skip" Miller, a partner at Miller Barondess LLP, said his client "never anticipated being obligated to pay—he's now looking at having to defend and deal with bond claims that otherwise would have been paid by Lehman." Last year, Mr. Elieff filed suit against Lehman in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana, Calif., to restructure the debt and cancel the bond obligations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Elieff's predicament is unusual these days: Developers were far more likely to risk and lose their personal fortunes during the real-estate collapse of the early 1990s, and many learned their lessons during the last cycle. Donald Trump, for example, who was pushed to the brink in the early 1990s, avoided investing any of his own money or signing for any of the debt on most of the projects that have carried his name in the past 15 years. When some, like the Trump SoHo, ran into financial problems, he wasn't exposed to any personal risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the other few exceptions to this rule in the current downturn was New York developer Harry Macklowe. He lost to creditors or was forced to sell much of his empire, including Manhattan's General Motors building, to resolve a debt he had personally guaranteed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hard-charging son of a Macedonian immigrant, Mr. Elieff and his brother Stephan built their father's small real-estate business into the largest land developer in the western U.S., worth $4 billion. Mr. Elieff was listed as the 25th-wealthiest person in Orange County in 2007, with an estimated personal fortune of $300 million, according to the Orange County Business Journal. But the following year he was taken off the list because of the "homebuilding downturn that has lowered values of SunCal land," according to the business paper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before it collapsed, Lehman had extended credit of $2.2 billion to SunCal. The 20 stalled projects—which were forced to seek bankruptcy protection—represent about $1.8 billion of those loans, and a spokeswoman for Lehman said the company is "actively pursuing" the resolution of those debts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Elieff signed personal guarantees on $230 million worth of surety bonds related to these now-bankrupt Lehman-funded projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In California, developers are typically required to enter into bonding agreements before a local government gives them the green light build. The builder pledges to construct roads, sewers, bridges and other public infrastructure for the new community, and these pledges are guaranteed personally by the developer—in this case, Mr. Elieff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Mr. Elieff isn't able to persuade the courts that Lehman is responsible for the $230 million in obligations, a judge could order him to cover them from his own personal assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This has happened before in similar circumstances. Earlier this summer, a California state judge signed an order of attachment on Mr. Elieff's personal property, including three houses in Orange County, one of them in a luxury golfing community in Newport Beach. The order stemmed from a dispute over a $9.2 million distressed loan from <span class="companylink">Central Pacific Bank</span>, guaranteed by Mr. Elieff, with which SunCal had planned to help fund a housing development in Alameda, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Central Pacific couldn't be immediately reached for comment, but the Alameda debt was sold as part of a portfolio of distressed loans in July 2008 to an investment group led by San Diego investor Keith Ayres. Mr. Ayres said in an interview that personal guarantees are "extremely typical" for land loans in California, and said he and his investors intend to pursue Mr. Elieff's assets if the note isn't paid in full.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to court filings in a California bankruptcy court, Mr. Elieff's signature and personal guarantee are attached to surety bonds on 10 residential developments, including $56.5 million of bonds related to Marblehead Coastal property, a planned 248-acre luxury housing and commercial development along the ocean in San Clemente. The city has demanded payment on $33 million of those bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other cities, including Palmdale, San Juan Capistrano and Beaumont, have demanded payment for bonds on SunCal projects that are personally guaranteed by Mr. Elieff. He hasn't yet been forced to cover these obligations personally, but he can be compelled to do so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's really critical to get moving again," said David Dillon, economic-development director of Beaumont. "SunCal had no money....In this real estate market, there are a lot of personal guarantees out there, and SunCal is one of the biggest."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Elieff said in an interview that he is confident Lehman would ultimately be held responsible for paying the bond obligations, citing an agreement last year to indemnify him in event of a default. Lehman denies that such an agreement was ever signed. The matter is being discussed as part of the continuing litigation between Lehman and SunCal.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anton Troianovski   </div><div>1134 words</div><div>28 September 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1988, just a year before a buzz saw hit New York's commercial real-estate market, two 20-something brokers decided it was a good time to start their own firm specializing in selling small- and midsize property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That firm managed to survive the onslaught and grew to a large player in the market. Now, 22 years later, Paul Massey and Robert Knakal are planning to roll the dice again. Massey Knakal Realty Services is getting into the business of arranging mortgages for commercial properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the timing is different for this venture. While Massey Knakal rode the last downdraft to the bottom, the new unit's debut comes as commercial sales in the New York market are showing signs of emerging from the recession upheaval. Deal volume is increasing,say, as property values seem to be stabilizing, financing options are growing and more lenders try to sell off foreclosed assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The carnage of the past few years hurt Massey Knakal like all real-estate brokerages. Its sales volume fell to $550 million in 2009, compared with $2 billion in 2007. The firm's new business also faces competition from established players like <span class="companylink">Meridian Capital Group</span> and Holliday Fenoglio Fowler.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Massey says market timing didn't play a big role in the decision to launch the mortgage unit. "We're doing it because I think our company is ready for it," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Massey Knakal's move focuses a spotlight on commercial buildings selling for between $1 million and $100 million. In the peak year of 2007, about $8 billion of buildings in this price range traded hands in New York City, according to Massey Knakal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Massey Knakal survived the early 1990s partly because its overhead was low. There were only a handful of salaried employees and the firm leased space in a building so old it still had an elevator attendant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today the firm has a staff of about 125 and that additional overhead put a strain on the firm during the down years. In 2008 the firm laid off staff. "In 2009, we got our teeth kicked in," Mr. Massey says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of commercial buildings being put up for sale is on the rise now in part because some banks are getting more aggressive in foreclosing on and selling off real estate. About 15% of the firm's roughly 500 listings of property for sale are lender-owned properties—compared with less than 5% a year ago, according to Mr. Massey, who estimates that figure will rise to as high as 25% by late next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another factor in the increasing sales: a thawing financing market. Wall Street is slowly starting again to slice and dice mortgages and sell them to investors, although the volume being generated from the securitized-mortgage market is still far below what it was during the boom. Some insurance companies and community banks also looking for deals.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim Carpenter, chief lending officer for Westbury-based New York Community Bancorp, says the number of new commercial real estate and multifamily loan applications his bank is receiving is on the rise. The bank, which focuses on lending on rent-regulated apartment buildings, is on pace to exceed its 2009 total of $2.6 billion in multifamily and commercial real estate loan originations, Mr. Carpenter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Massey calls mortgage brokerage "an underserved market." But the business might not prove as lucrative as sales. Eastern Consolidated, one of Massey Knakal's competitors in building sales, also arranges mortgages—but it's not the company's focus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Mortgage lending is kind of a different animal," according to Eric Michael Anton, an executive managing director at Eastern Consolidated. "It's a lot of work, it's a commodity [and] you don't really get great fees on it."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The largest number of bank failures in nearly 20 years has eliminated jobs, accelerated a drought in lending and left the industry's survivors with more power to squeeze customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some 279 banks have collapsed since Sept. 25, 2008, when <span class="companylink">Washington Mutual Inc</span>. became the biggest bank failure on record. That dwarfed the 1984 demise of Continental Illinois, which had one-seventh of <span class="companylink">WaMu</span>'s assets. The failures of the past two years shattered the pace of the prior six-year period, when only three dozen banks died.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two more banks went down last Friday, and failures are expected to "persist for some time," according to a report issued Tuesday by <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>. In the second quarter of this year, the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp</span>. increased its number of problem banks by 6% to 829.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between failures and consolidation, the number of U.S. banks could fall to 5,000 over the next decade from the current 7,932, according to an executive at investment-banking firm Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upside of failures is that they can represent a healthy cleansing of a sector that grew too fast, with bank assets more than doubling to $13.8 trillion in the decade that ended in 2008. Many banks that failed were opportunistic latecomers. Of the failed banks since February 2007, 75 were formed after 1999, according to SNL Financial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, economists say, the contraction represents an enduring threat to capital, lending and the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When we step back and look at this financial disaster 10 years from now, the destruction of capital in our economy as a result of what we've endured will be the single greatest lasting impact on recovery and how the economy performs in the future," says Howard Headlee, president of the Utah Bankers Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pain is less severe than in the Japanese banking crisis, in which banks languished for a decade despite $440 billion the government spent to assist the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, in the past two years, the whole U.S. banking system recoiled. Large banks like <span class="companylink">Countrywide Financial Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Wachovia Corp</span>. were acquired to avert failure while powerful banks including <span class="companylink">Citigroup Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>. were propped up by the government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between the failures and government assistance, Gerard Cassidy of <span class="companylink">RBC Capital Markets</span> says, the impact to the system has been "far more severe" than the savings-and-loan crisis. Not only were government rescue measures more sweeping and more global this time, the weakness in real estate continues to constrain economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2008, the industry's assets have shrunk by 4.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you reduce the amount of assets at a bank, it means they make fewer loans, and that has a negative impact on the economy," says Richard Bove, a bank analyst at Rochdale Securities in Lutz, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From small towns like Rockford, Ill., to Miami, the banks' disappearance means not only cutbacks in lending but fewer banking choices, lower interest rates on savings accounts, and lost jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recession and collapse of the housing bubble have cut bank-industry employment by 188,000 jobs, or 8.5%, since 2007, according to FDIC data. Failures alone have cost 11,210 jobs, or 32% of the employees at failed banks, according to FIG Partners, an Atlanta investment firm that specializes in the banking industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For more than a year, Martin Quantz and his co-workers at the Woodstock, Ill., branch of Amcore Bank checked the FDIC's website each Friday afternoon to see if their flailing bank had gone under. Regulators seized the bank in April and turned over its 58 branches to Harris National Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By August, Mr. Quantz was unemployed. He now hopes reconnecting with an old contact will lead to a new bank job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a lot of pain out there, and there are a lot of people in the industry who won't go back," says Mr. Quantz, 41 years old.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city of Clinton, Utah, may never be refunded $83,000, a portion of their cemetery-maintenance funds that wasn't insured when nearby Centennial Bank failed without a buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In nearby Ogden, Utah, Weber State University lost $100,000 in scholarship money that had been pledged by <span class="companylink">Barnes Banking Co</span>., a 119-year-old local institution that failed in January. The scholarships, to be distributed in $1,000 increments, represented one-quarter of in-state tuition, says a Weber State administrator. Earlier this month, the college restored the <span class="companylink">Barnes Banking</span> Lecture Hall to its original name: "Room 110."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Failed bank assets are now strewn across the banking system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FDIC is burdened with $38 billion of remnants it is trying to sell. They range from virtually worthless mortgaged-backed securities to office decorations such as plastic Christmas trees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tough times follow cresting prosperity in which banks with few loan losses chased customers into hot real-estate markets. When the subprime mortgage bubble burst, failures were concentrated among mortgage lenders such as <span class="companylink">IndyMac Bank</span>, which left $1 billion of depositors' money uninsured when it failed in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Autopsies of expired banks all point to real estate as the primary cause. A tally by SNL Financial LC found that 94% of bank failures since 2008 had either residential or commercial real estate as their largest category of delinquent loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KBW says their riskier construction loans were 23% of their total portfolio, compared with 7.2% for the industry as a whole. The delinquency rate of commercial real estate was 13.5%, far above the current national average of 1.7%, SNL said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Various autopsies of expired banks all point to real estate as the primary cause. A tally by SNL Financial LC found that 94% of bank failures since 2008 had either residential or commercial real-estate as their largest category of delinquent loans. KBW says their riskier construction loans were 23% of their total portfolio, compared with 7.2% for the industry as a whole. The delinquency rate of commercial real estate was 13.5%, far above the current national average of 1.7%, SNL said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Imperial Capital Bank</span> unit of Imperial Capital Bancorp in La Jolla, Calif., specialized in real estate. Like many other small banks, it extended beyond its home turf and made loans nationwide. The bank more than doubled its assets to $4.1 billion in the five years ended in 2008, according to an FDIC report. Then, the nine-branch bank purchased $826 million of mortgage-backed securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate accounted for more than 95% of its loans, compared to 35% or less for its peers. The bank failed in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists argue that, for all the damage, the failures' impact on the economy was muted because the largest banks that failed or came close were quickly absorbed by other institutions or helped by the government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't think enough banks have failed, or have been failing fast enough, to have a macro-economic impact," says economist Edward Yardeni.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surviving banks have raised more than $500 billion in new capital, reducing the risks of new failures by boosting rainy-day funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Failure can occasionally jumpstart lending. To conserve capital, regulators often block sickly banks from making new loans. When a bank buys the assets of the failed institution, that buyer often resumes lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since acquiring operations of the failed Frontier Bank in Everett, Wash., last April, Union Bank N.A. has started originating loans in Frontier's region in western Washington and Oregon. Though Union lowered interest rates on certificates of deposit, "We desire to grow our loan portfolio and are eager to find ways to make loans that make sense," says Tim Wennes, chief retail banking officer for Union Bank, a unit of San Francisco-based <span class="companylink">UnionBanCal Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such consolidation also means the biggest are getting bigger: <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co</span>. and <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> hold 33% of all U.S. deposits, up from 21% in 2006, according to SNL Financial. That gives them more market power to squeeze out smaller competitors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Squires, who was chief executive officer of Old Southern Bank when it failed in March, protests that his larger competitors in his Orlando, Fla., neighborhood all survived thanks to heavy doses of government support, which allowed them to raise capital more easily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Absolutely unfair—the big boys have the clout," says Mr. Squires. "Community banks are in jeopardy all over the country."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For months, home buyers and sellers have been stuck in an unusual standoff, with sellers reluctant to lower prices and buyers staying on the sidelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New data suggest that standoff eased slightly last month, as sales of existing, or previously owned, homes rose 7.6% from July, according to figures released Thursday by the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while the housing market may have halted a slide that began in April after federal home-buyer tax credits expired, it still faces a long recovery, and buyers remain scarce. The inventory of unsold homes fell 0.6% in August to 3.98 million, but it would still take 11.6 months at the current sales pace to clear that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The only way to sell a home in this environment is to drop the price," said John Burns, a housing consultant based in Irvine, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing numbers have prompted a debate among economists about how much further prices need to fall to resuscitate sales. Home prices are likely to fall another 2.2% this year, according to the consensus estimate of 114 economists and housing analysts surveyed this month by MacroMarkets LLC, a provider of hedging products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The picture varies from region to region. Home prices in several Florida and Nevada markets are likely to fall at least another 5%, while parts of Texas and Oklahoma could post modest gains over the next year, said Eric Fox, vice president of statistical and economic modeling at in Santa Ana, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, prices in July fell by 0.5% on a seasonally adjusted basis, according to figures this week from the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span>. The S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home-price index will issue its report on July prices next week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consequently, sellers face a difficult decision: get off the market or cut the price. Sonja Brisson decided to get out. After listing her home for three months, she began interviewing prospective renters on Tuesday. Ms. Brisson, who is moving to live with her fiance, will lose money renting out her Seattle town home, but said it was better than competing with distressed sales going for 30% less than what she paid for her property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renting the home is "just a total crapshoot," she said. "Nobody saw this coming, and nobody can see the end of it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weak demand in the housing market comes amid other signs that the economy is improving, but at a painfully slow pace. An index of leading economic indicators, which aims to help predict where the economy is headed, rose 0.3% in August after increasing 0.1% in July, the Conference Board said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the lingering weakness is linked to sluggish improvements in the job market. Some 465,000 unemployed workers filed new claims for jobless benefits last week, up 12,000 from the week before, the Labor Department said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without jobs, families are still relying on tactics they employed during the recession -- such as households doubling up -- to make ends meet. That's pulling down demand for housing and, in turn, prices and construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As those jobs get created, people who have been doubling up will start moving out of those homes and demand will pick up," said Patrick Newport, an IHS Global Insight economist. "As that happens -- it's going to happen very slowly -- the glut will start coming down."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weak economy is just one reason why buyer psychology remains depressed. The housing market also faces a "shadow inventory" of four to five million potential foreclosures that have not yet come to market but could put pressure on prices once they do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Why do you rush out today to buy something when you think there are going to be millions more for sale soon," said Michael Feder, chief executive of real-estate data firm Radar Logic Inc. The question, he said, is "how much lower do prices have to go to attract the buyers?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even investors, who have been active over the past year buying homes at what they believed were big discounts, are pulling back. "They think everything will be cheaper next year," said Mr. Burns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As prices fall, more sellers could find themselves in Patrick Minton's shoes. He's already dropped the price on his Seattle home to $400,000, which is less than what he owes. He'll already have to pay transaction costs out of pocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home hasn't received any offers, and he isn't willing to cut the price anymore unless his bank agrees to a short sale. Mr. Minton, a 42-year-old software developer, listed his home in July after getting divorced and said he'd stay if the bank would let him refinance at current rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While 11 million borrowers are under water, or owe more than their homes are worth, another 2.5 million will join them if prices fall just another 5%, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic Inc</span>., a real-estate analytics firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're between a rock and a hard place," said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of <span class="companylink">Redfin Corp</span>., a real-estate brokerage that operates in nine states. "They'd capitulate if the bank would let them."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is suffocating the market because those sellers are also would-be buyers. "Right now, we have investors and first-timers in control of the market, and until that changes, we will never be on the mend," said Mark Hanson, an independent housing analyst in Menlo Park, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market will eventually need more buyers like Robert Gifford, who spent six months with his wife scouring their Beacon Hill neighborhood in Seattle before pulling the trigger on a sale in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it came time to sell their smaller home this month, they didn't dawdle. They cut the listing price by around 10% to $334,000 earlier this month, and it quickly went to contract. "We didn't want to become an involuntary landlord," said the 31-year-old engineer.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For months, home buyers and sellers have been stuck in a curious stalemate, with sellers reluctant to lower prices and buyers staying on the sidelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New data suggest the standoff eased slightly last month, as sales of existing, or previously owned, homes rose 7.6% from July's extremely low levels, according to figures released Thursday by the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while the housing market may have halted a slide that began in April after federal home-buyer tax credits expired, it still faces a long recovery, and buyers remain scarce. The August figures were the lowest for any month since 1997 except for July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while the number of unsold homes fell 0.6% in August to 3.98 million, it would still take 11.6 months at the current sales pace to clear the inventory. That's the second highest figure since the realtors' group began tracking the data in 1999, behind July's 12.5 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The only way to sell a home in this environment is to drop the price," said John Burns, a housing consultant based in Irvine, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing numbers have prompted a debate among economists about how much further prices need to fall to resuscitate sales.

The housing market also faces a "shadow inventory" of four to five million potential foreclosures that have not yet come to market but could put pressure on prices if they do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Why do you rush out today to buy something when you think there are going to be millions more for sale soon," said Michael Feder, chief executive of real-estate data firm Radar Logic Inc. The question, he said, is "how much lower do prices have to go to attract the buyers?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even investors, who have been active over the past year buying homes at what they believed were big discounts, are pulling back. "They think everything will be cheaper next year," said Mr. Burns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As prices fall, more sellers could find themselves in Patrick Minton's shoes. He's already dropped the price on his Seattle home to $400,000, which is less than what he owes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home hasn't received any offers, and he isn't willing to cut the price any more unless his bank agrees to a short sale. Mr. Minton, a 42-year-old software developer, listed his home in July after getting divorced and said he'd stay if the bank would let him refinance at current rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While 11 million borrowers are underwater, or owe more than their homes are worth, another 2.5 million will join them if prices decline just another 5%, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic Inc</span>., a real-estate analytics firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're between a rock and a hard place," said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of <span class="companylink">Redfin Corp</span>., a real-estate brokerage that operates in nine states. "They'd capitulate if the bank would let them."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is suffocating the market because those sellers are also would-be buyers. "Right now, we have investors and first-timers in control of the market, and until that changes, we will never be on the mend," said Mark Hanson, an independent housing analyst in Menlo Park, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market will eventually need more buyers like Robert Gifford, who spent six months with his wife scouring their Beacon Hill neighborhood in southeast Seattle before pulling the trigger on a sale in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it came time to sell their smaller home this month, they didn't dawdle. They cut the listing price by around 10% to $334,000, and it quickly went to contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We didn't want to become an involuntary landlord," said the 31-year-old engineer.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European stocks shed modest early gains, ending in the red Tuesday as investors waited for news from a meeting of the Federal Reserve committee in charge of monetary policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The losses came despite successful bond auctions by some of the countries embroiled most deeply in the European sovereign-debt crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Stoxx Europe 600 index ended down 0.5% at 265.01. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 closed down 0.5% at 5576.19, Germany's DAX fell 0.3% to 6275.98 and France's CAC-40 closed 0.1% lower at 3784.40. With many of the main European indexes surpassing technically key levels this week, traders said that any upside would undoubtedly be capped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 7.41 points, or 0.1%, at 10761.03 after the Federal Reserve held rates steady and said inflation levels remained below its comfort zone, hinting at the possibility of further quantitative easing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Market sentiment improved a touch during the first part of the session as Ireland successfully offered 500 million euros ($653 million) of 2014 bonds and 1 billion euros of 2018 bonds. Also Treasury bill auctions raised 7.04 billion euros for Spain and 390 million euros for Greece.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These countries have been at the epicenter of the European sovereign-debt crisis. Last week, Ireland was forced to deny it is going to appeal to the International Monetary Fund for financial assistance. And just four months ago, Athens was frozen out of the sovereign bond market when it came perilously close to default, but was rescued by the European Union and the IMF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The auction results bode well for an auction of Portuguese debt on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, U.S. housing starts for August surprised investors, rising 10.5% in the month. The outcome was stronger than expected and marked the first positive year-on-year reading since May, said Annalisa Piazza, economist at Newedge Strategy. Ms. Piazza warned not to expect a reacceleration in housing activity. "Sideways movements are the most likely scenario in the coming months," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the positive data, there was a sense overall of markets treading water ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee rate announcement and subsequent comments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although many market participants didn't expect the Federal Reserve to expand its quantitative-easing measures or change interest rates, most were keen to hear the rhetoric of the committee, to see whether the potential for a slowdown in growth has increased since the last meeting. The Federal Open Market Committee's announcement came after the close of European financial markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the foreign-exchange markets Tuesday, the euro was at $1.3244 from $1.3062 late Monday. The dollar was at 85.12 yen from 85.75 yen, while the euro was at 112.75 yen from 112.02 yen. The U.K. pound was at $1.5613 from $1.5552. The dollar was at 0.9972 Swiss franc from 1.0050 francs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In major market action: Banks were in focus once again, with shares in <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span> up 1% in Paris following reports that its chief executive said the company won't need to raise more capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Natixis fell 4.7% after Goldman cut its rating to "sell" from "neutral." <span class="companylink">Cairn Energy</span> added 2.3% after saying it found oil in Greenland.</p>

</div><div class="author">By William Boston Special to The WSJ   </div><div>942 words</div><div>22 September 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>24</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors and lenders are getting creative as Europe's lingering credit squeeze puts pressure on banks to refinance a mountain of debt over the next few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One sign of this: Germany's <span class="companylink">Eurohypo AG</span> has taken control of an office development at 6 Bevis Marks in London from Spanish developer Monteverde and is now in talks to build on the site. Rather than sell the development outright, and be forced to book the losses, <span class="companylink">Eurohypo</span> is retaining a link to the property by forming a joint venture that will allow it to share in any future profits from the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another example of investor creativity, mezzanine-debt lenders are beginning to re-emerge. The latest example of the trend involves <span class="companylink">LaSalle Investment Management</span>, a unit of property-services group <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> with $40 billion of assets under management. It has raised GBP 100 million ($155.5 million) for a U.K. Special Situations fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amy Aznar, head of special situations at <span class="companylink">LaSalle Investment Management</span>, says the fund is negotiating with several major banks to provide mezzanine financing to help the lenders work with borrowers to restructure loans on a number of central London office properties. She declined to identify them. "About GBP 200 billion of debt is coming due in the U.K. over the next four to five years, and it either needs to be extended or to be refinanced," says Ms. Aznar. "We are dealing with a number of banks directly, and we are seeing a lot of borrowers come to us for refinancing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mezzanine financing is typically provided by a lender in exchange for rights to convert the debt to equity in the case of nonpayment. It is becoming increasingly attractive because as European property markets slowly recover, the squeeze on debt financing shows no signs of easing. That is frustrating efforts of private-equity investors to make acquisitions while prices are still low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many a deal over the past year has failed to be completed because of what investors call the "debt gap," the difference between what banks are willing to lend and what an investor needs to ensure that an acquisition generates the returns required by private-equity funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks are under pressure to refinance about GBP 50 billion of debt a year for the next four to five years, and new Basel III capital rules that will require banks to maintain 7% core capital are forcing banks to strengthen their balance sheets. The situation is creating an opportunity for mezzanine lenders to step in to fill the debt gap, and possibly reap hefty profits for their services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Aznar says LaSalle's offering won't be limited to mezzanine financing because there is also a growing need for lending to help finance new developments and acquisitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is not just for refinancing, but also for new purchases," she says. "A lot of private-equity buyers can't get 80% to 85% loan-to-value today, and that makes it hard to make a 20% internal rate of return."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between 2005 and 2007, about GBP 232 billion of new debt was lent to the property sector in the U.K., according to a survey of the industry by De Montfort University. The majority of the U.K. loans were made by a handful of large lenders, such as <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC</span>, <span class="companylink">Lloyds Banking Group PLC</span>, <span class="companylink">Eurohypo</span> and <span class="companylink">Hypo Real Estate</span>. RBS and Lloyds received huge bailouts by the British government during the crisis. <span class="companylink">Hypo Real Estate</span> was nationalized by the German government and renamed Deutsche Pfandbriefbank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The banks are now moving to reduce the size of their balance sheets and weed out nonperforming loans, creating opportunities for debt investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, RBS sold a 1.4 billion euro ($1.83 billion) portfolio of European senior loans backed by a diverse range of properties, to <span class="companylink">Intermediate Capital Group PLC</span>, a private-equity investor that specializes in mezzanine finance. The portfolio represented about 10% of RBS's leveraged loan portfolio at the end of June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In light of sluggishness among European property stocks, some investors are turning to debt as a way to achieve better returns. Executives at a number of major institutions, including APG Asset Management, the Dutch pension-fund manager with 200 billion euros of assets under management, have said in recent weeks that mezzanine financing provided an opportunity for taking advantage of market distress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Eurohypo</span>'s 6 Bevis Marks deal, meanwhile, is a typical way that banks are trying to work out distressed loans without being forced to book any losses. <span class="companylink">Eurohypo</span> did a similar deal recently with U.K. real-estate investment trust <span class="companylink">Great Portland Estates PLC</span>. That joint venture was set up to complete construction of a London West End office development called Marcol House.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors believe such opportunities are bound to increase over the coming year as banks continue to shrink their balance sheets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are still big liquidity issues," says Jos Short, chairman and founding partner of Internos Real Investors, a U.K.-based REIT with 1.5 billion euros under management. "Over the next 12 to 24 months, there will be more unbundling [of banks' real-estate assets] than we've seen so far since the crisis."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 6 Bevis Marks development could be partly financed by French insurance group <span class="companylink">AXA SA</span>, according to people that are familiar with the situation.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. housing starts surged a better-than-expected 10.5% in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 598,000 on strength in multifamily construction, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by had expected overall housing starts to fall 0.2% to 545,000 during August, largely because buyers have remained concerned about a weak job market and uncertain economic prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">August's figures indicate a strong month-on-monthrise even after the April 30 expiration of tax incentives for first-time purchases, and a 2.2% rise from the same period a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family housing starts rose in August by 4.3% to an annual rate of 438,000. Groundbreakings on homes with two or more units in August surged 32.2% to 160,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits increased 1.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 569,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department's numbers also reflect a downward revision of July's figures to 541,000 starts from 546,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sharp increase in August starts was a surprise. The housing market tumbled after a government tax incentive for some purchases ended April 30. While mortgage rates are low, the job market is weak, discouraging would-be buyers. The builders that are willing to overlook lousy sales and break ground face problems securing credit as the economy slowly recovers from a financial crisis and a recession that lasted 18 months, the longest the country has endured since the Great Depression.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builder <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>. said Monday that its sales pace fell in the third quarter because the tax credit ended. The profit that the company reported was helped by finance-related activities largely unrelated to the core home-building business. Chief Executive Stuart Miller noted that "high unemployment and foreclosures have continued to present challenges for the national housing market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A housing-industry group this week released results of a survey of home builders showing a gauge of sales expectations over the next six months remained unchanged at a very low level, while a gauge of traffic of prospective buyers edged down. "Fewer shoppers are walking through showroom doors -- a sign that Americans by and large just aren't that excited about the prospect of buying a house," said Mike Larson, an analyst at Weiss Research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regionally, housing starts in August increased 7.0% in the South, 34.3% in the West, and 21.7% in the Midwest. Starts fell 24.3% in the Northeast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said actual housing starts rose to 54,800 in August from 50,600 in July. Lumber and commodities markets watch those numbers closely to gauge demand.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Aaron Back </div><div>902 words</div><div>22 September 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Asia</div><div>AWSJ</div><div>12</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEIJING -- China is set to see a wave of demand for quality commercial real estate as insurance companies are allowed for the first time to invest in the sector, according to Colin Dyer, the chief executive officer of real-estate consultancy <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, China's insurance regulator announced a long-awaited revision to its rules, allowing insurance companies to invest as much as 10% of their assets in commercial real estate and put up to 20% of their assets into the stock market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts are concerned that restrictions put in place this year on home purchases will become a drag on overall economic growth as construction and investment activity in that sector slows. New demand for commercial real estate from insurers could therefore become an important support for the property sector and the wider Chinese economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's insurance companies have around 4.6 trillion yuan ($685.15 billion) of assets under management, growing at around 20% per year, Mr. Dyer said in an interview on Monday. If they invest their full 10% allotment into commercial real estate, that amounts to 460 billion yuan, or $68.5 billion of potential demand, compared with just $17 billion of total investment last year in commercial real estate, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"So you've got a massive potential pulse of investment money looking for real estate in China," Mr. Dyer said. "It will promote development work to meet that investment demand."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insurance companies invest for the long term and want to derive as much as 20 years of cash flow from a property, which will drive demand for quality, "investment grade" properties, Mr. Dyer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would mark a sea change in China, where developers often follow a "build-and-sell" model of unloading a property with little regard for its long-term viability, which has negative consequences for building quality and management practices, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real-estate sector accounts for around 10% of China's gross domestic product, giving rise to concerns that if there is a downturn in the sector it could drag the rest of the economy down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts say a renewed drive by Beijing to encourage the construction of more affordable housing will be an important support measure. New demand for commercial property could help as well, although its importance is limited, as around 70% of the total real-estate market in China is residential, <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone is enthusiastic about the prospect of large-scale investment by insurance companies in China's property market. In a recent report, <span class="companylink">Moody's Corp</span>. warned that the risks of investing in property may outweigh the benefits and could hurt the creditworthiness of Chinese insurers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial real estate in China is characterized by high vacancy rates, and prices have risen strongly in the past year, the credit-ratings company said. "We are wary of insurers purchasing real-estate assets at their high point," it said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In China's top-tier cities, vacancy rates are high by international standards. <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> estimates that 22.8% of Beijing's premium "Grade A" office space was vacant at the end of June. But it also estimates that since the start of the year, the vacancy rate has fallen by 5.3 percentage points and office rents have risen by 7.3%. In Shanghai, 11.5% of Grade-A office space in the central business districts was vacant, unchanged from the start of the year, but rents are up 6.6% year to date.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's high growth rate helps explain the disparity between high vacancy rates and rising rents, Mr. Dyer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In the context of China's astronomical growth rate, a 20% vacancy rate, which would be a big problem in a Western city in a mature economy growing at 2%-3%, is just a year-and-a-half supply in China," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, Mr. Dyer isn't very concerned about the outlook for China's residential market, despite widespread concerns that home prices are too high, especially in major cities. <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> is less directly involved in that market than in the commercial real-estate market, but based on what the company hears from market participants, Mr. Dyer believes underlying demand for homes remains strong in China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chinese government has instituted a series of measures since April to cool the residential property market, including higher down payment requirements for mortgages. "Although that might control pricing for a while, it's unlikely to reduce the absolute level of demand and transaction levels, simply because the demand is so strong," Mr. Dyer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property prices in 70 Chinese cities were flat for the second consecutive month in August, but up 9.3% from a year earlier, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In terms of floor space, nationwide property sales fell 10.1% to 68.9 million square meters in August from the same month a year earlier, but were higher than July's 64.7 million square meters. The rebound came one month ahead of the usual peak month for property sales in September.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A decent house has long been a symbol of middle-class American family life. Practically, it has been a secure shelter for the children and provided access to a good public education. And financially, it has been regarded as a safe store of value, a shield against the vagaries of the economy and a long-term retirement asset.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All that seems a distant memory for the millions of American families who must confront the decline in the value of their homes. The pressure to meet mortgage payments on properties that have lost value has been especially shocking for those who have lost their jobs in the Great Recession. Their houses have become a ball and chain, restricting their ability to seek employment elsewhere. They cannot afford to abandon the remaining equity they have in their houses -- and they can't sell in this miserable market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales, pending home sales, and mortgage applications are down to a 13-year low, despite long-term mortgage rates that plummeted recently to an average 4.3% before rising slightly. New home prices have fallen by an average of 30%. According to David Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff, this has reduced home occupancy cost to 15% of family incomes, down from the conventional 25%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fall in house prices has eaten away at the equity Americans have in their homes. About 11 million residential properties have mortgage balances that exceed the home's value, notes Mr. Rosenberg. And given the total inventory of homes and the shadow inventory of 3.7 million empty (foreclosed) homes, he notes that prices might fall another 5% to 10%. That would leave an estimated 40% of American homeowners with mortgages in excess of the value of their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Disappearing equity invites strategic defaults. Homeowners with negative equity are tempted simply to mail in their keys to their friendly lender even if they can afford the mortgage payment. Yet banks don't want to take the deflated properties onto their books because they will then have to declare a financial loss and still have to worry about maintaining the properties. Little wonder, according to Mr. Rosenberg, that foreclosure has not been enforced on a quarter of the people who haven't made a single mortgage payment in the last two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A staggering eight million home loans are in some state of delinquency, default or foreclosure, Alan Abelson reported in Barron's in July. He noted that another eight million homeowners are estimated to have mortgages representing 95% or more of the value of their homes, leaving them with 5% or less equity in their homes and thus vulnerable to further price declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of foreclosures slowed briefly thanks to loan modifications by the Home Affordable Modification Program and other government efforts. But the programs have not been working as hoped -- it's been reported that half of the borrowers have been redefaulting within 12 months, even after monthly payments were cut by as much as 50%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the foreclosure pipeline remains clogged, as it unclogs a new wave of homes will wash into the market and precipitate additional downward pressure on prices. The number of foreclosed homes put on the market by banks will be a more powerful influence on the further decline of home prices than either consumer demand or interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A well-balanced housing market has a supply of about five to six months. These days the inventory backlog has surged to about a 12 1/2 months' supply. This explains why average sale prices have been declining for so many months. The high end of the market, in particular, is under great pressure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mortgage market is also deeply troubled. Conventional lenders now insist on a substantial down payment and impose other more stringent financial requirements. Household formation (marriages) is also shrinking now, down to an annual rate of about 600,000, compared to net household formation in excess of a million annually during the bubble years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most critical factor subduing the demand for housing is that home ownership is no longer seen as the great, long-term buildup in equity value. So it is not too difficult to understand why demand for housing has declined and will not revive anytime soon.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. housing starts surged a better-than-expected 10.5% in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 598,000 on strength in multifamily construction, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires expected overall housing starts to decrease by 0.2% to 545,000 during August, largely because buyers have remained concerned with a weak job market and uncertain economic prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But August's figures indicate a strong month-on-month rise even after the April 30 expiration of tax incentives for first-time purchases, and a 2.2% rise from the same period a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family housing starts rose in August by 4.3% to an annual rate of 438,000. Groundbreakings of homes with two or more units in August surged 32.2% to 160,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits increased 1.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 569,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commerce's numbers also reflect a downward revision of July's figures to 541,000 starts from 546,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sharp increase in August starts was a surprise. The housing market tumbled after a government tax incentive for first-time purchases ended April 30. While mortgage rates are low, the job market is bad, turning off would-be buyers. And for those builders willing to overlook lousy sales and break ground, they face problems securing credit as the economy slowly recovers from a financial crisis and a recession that lasted 18 months, the longest the country has endured since the Great Depression.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-builder Lennar Corp. said Monday its sales pace fell in the third quarter because the tax credit ended. The profit that the company reported was helped by finance-related activities largely unrelated to the core home-building business. Chief Executive Stuart Miller noted that "high unemployment and foreclosures have continued to present challenges for the national housing market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A housing industry group this week released results of a survey of home builders showing a gauge of sales expectations over the next six months remain unchanged at a very low level, while a gauge of traffic of prospective buyers edged down. "Fewer shoppers are walking through showroom doors -- a sign that Americans by and large just aren't that excited about the prospect of buying a house," said Mike Larson, an analyst at Weiss Research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regionally, housing starts in August increased 7.0% in the South, 34.3% in the West, and 21.7% in the Midwest. Starts fell 24.3% in the Northeast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said actual housing starts rose to 54,800 in August from 50,600 in July. Lumber and commodities markets watch those numbers closely to gauge demand.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A decent house has long been a symbol of middle-class American family life. Practically, it has been a secure shelter for the children and provided access to a good public education. And financially, it has been regarded as a safe store of value, a shield against the vagaries of the economy and a long-term retirement asset.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All that seems a distant memory for the millions of American families who must confront the decline in the value of their homes. The pressure to meet mortgage payments on properties that have lost value has been especially shocking for those who have lost their jobs in the Great Recession. Their houses have become a ball and chain, restricting their ability to seek employment elsewhere. They cannot afford to abandon the remaining equity they have in their houses—and they can't sell in this miserable market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales, pending home sales, and mortgage applications are down to a 13-year low, despite long-term mortgage rates that plummeted recently to an average 4.3% before rising slightly. New home prices have fallen by an average of 30%. According to David Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff, this has reduced home occupancy cost to 15% of family incomes, down from the conventional 25%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fall in house prices has eaten away at the equity Americans have in their homes. About 11 million residential properties have mortgage balances that exceed the home's value, notes Mr. Rosenberg. And given the total inventory of homes and the shadow inventory of 3.7 million empty (foreclosed) homes, he notes that prices might fall another 5% to 10%. That would leave an estimated 40% of American homeowners with mortgages in excess of the value of their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Disappearing equity invites strategic defaults. Homeowners with negative equity are tempted simply to mail in their keys to their friendly lender even if they can afford the mortgage payment. Yet banks don't want to take the deflated properties onto their books because they will then have to declare a financial loss and still have to worry about maintaining the properties. Little wonder, according to Mr. Rosenberg, that foreclosure has not been enforced on a quarter of the people who haven't made a single mortgage payment in the last two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A staggering eight million home loans are in some state of delinquency, default or foreclosure, Alan Abelson reported in Barron's in July. He noted that another eight million homeowners are estimated to have mortgages representing 95% or more of the value of their homes, leaving them with 5% or less equity in their homes and thus vulnerable to further price declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of foreclosures slowed briefly thanks to loan modifications by the Home Affordable Modification Program and other government efforts. But the programs have not been working as hoped—it's been reported that half of the borrowers have been redefaulting within 12 months, even after monthly payments were cut by as much as 50%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the foreclosure pipeline remains clogged, as it unclogs a new wave of homes will wash into the market and precipitate additional downward pressure on prices. The number of foreclosed homes put on the market by banks will be a more powerful influence on the further decline of home prices than either consumer demand or interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A well-balanced housing market has a supply of about five to six months. These days the inventory backlog has surged to about a 12½ months' supply. This explains why average sale prices have been declining for so many months. The high end of the market, in particular, is under great pressure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mortgage market is also deeply troubled. Conventional lenders now insist on a substantial down payment and impose other more stringent financial requirements. Household formation (marriages) is also shrinking now, down to an annual rate of about 600,000, compared to net household formation in excess of a million annually during the bubble years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most critical factor subduing the demand for housing is that home ownership is no longer seen as the great, long-term buildup in equity value. So it is not too difficult to understand why demand for housing has declined and will not revive anytime soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a disturbing development for those who believe that housing is going to lead America to an economic recovery, as it did during the Great Depression and every recession since. In the past, residential construction preceded the recovery in the larger economy. This time a lead weight on recovery has been the disappearance of some $6 trillion of home equity value, a loss that has had a devastating effect on consumer confidence, retirement savings and current spending.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the East River, two new residential projects on the Williamsburg waterfront look like towering glass edifices. On the other side, they meet the neighborhood as six-story brick apartment buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two-faced design is an outcome of the city's ambitious plan, approved in 2005, to turn the industrial waterfront of the Williamsburg and Greenpoint neighborhoods of Brooklyn into a dense residential area. At the time, planners and local advocates were concerned about how high-rise, high-priced condos would fit with the largely low-rise, mixed-income community that's inland from the waterfront.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City officials responded by calling on developers to use design to connect inland neighborhoods to the waterfront. The tallest buildings, the city said, should be close to the water where they would "frame new open spaces." Shorter buildings would be built at the neighborhood's edge to create "a smooth transition in building scale and form." The city also allowed developers to build taller if they created more affordable-housing units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two new projects, Northside Piers and the Williamsburg Edge, both near the intersection of North Fifth Street and Kent Avenue, are early signs of how the rezoning could change part of the Brooklyn waterfront. The Edge consists of two high rises, with 565 market-rate apartments, 299 feet and 150 feet tall, that tower over the river with a facade of oversize windows, translucent blue balconies, and cream-colored concrete panels—a sharp contrast with the aging storage tanks and rusty piers a few hundred feet away. Behind the towers, the Edge also includes two lower-rise apartment buildings, which include 347 affordable units and face Kent Avenue with a facade of light and dark brick that echoes older brick buildings nearby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What we were trying to do was to create a project that sort of melds into the urban context," says Stephen B. Jacobs, architect of the Edge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To critics, however, the new towers are a portent of a future barrier of high-rises stretching along the western edge of north Brooklyn. "These bland towers marching all the way along—it's going to wall off the entire water," said William Menking, an architecture professor at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn.</p>

About 160 people from ImClone, which will research potential cancer-fighting products at the site, will occupy more than 90,000 square feet in a 16-story glass and steel tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building's opening comes in the wake of a broader New York City effort to attract businesses that spin out from discoveries and research taking place in its universities and hospitals. The city is hoping the specialized lab space offered in the new center and in several other expanding or new locations around the city will help New York compete for jobs and companies in the biotech industry that has been dominated by established hubs such as Cambridge, Mass., and the San Francisco region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The addition of the center and its critical mass of lab space is the last missing piece needed to win over more biotech companies, says Kathryn Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, which has helped to develop the park. "It's certainly a breakthrough," says Ms. Wylde of the center." When somebody starts a company, makes an investment and recruits staff, they want to know there's a place to grow."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The center's 310,000-square-foot tower is more than 50% leased and nearly all of the remaining space in the tower is in negotiations to be leased, says Joel S. Marcus, chief executive of <span class="companylink">Alexandria Real Estate Equities</span>. He says he hopes to complete the full project by about 2017.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the U.S. hotel market recovering, some of the country's largest hotel companies are poised to resume their efforts to divest themselves of real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brands such as <span class="companylink">Marriott International Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Hilton Hotels</span> Worldwide began divesting their properties in the 1980s to focus on the more lucrative and less capital-hungry business of managing the properties for fees. By now, most have only a few dozen properties remaining on their balance sheets, and they are looking to further whittle their holdings after holding off during the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their moves mean that several large, high-quality hotels are likely to change hands this year and next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The timing is ripe to restart such divestitures because hotel results are rebounding, with revenue per room in the U.S. expected to post strong gains this year and occupancies on the rise. In addition, big buyers are flush with cash and credit, and the number of new hotels opening in the U.S. is starting to taper off. A reduction in new hotels means stronger cash flows for existing hotels and, in turn, rising property values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's maybe the beginning of some opportunities, because there is a fair amount of capital on the sidelines interested in investing in this space," said Jim Anhut, chief development officer in the Americas division of <span class="companylink">InterContinental Hotels Group PLC</span>, owner of brands including Holiday Inn and InterContinental. "We're a cyclical business, and people are seeing the bottom of the cycle."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Closely held brand Fairmont Hotels and Resorts last month sold its 383-room Fairmont Boston Copley Plaza Hotel to FelCor Lodging Trust, a real-estate investment trust, for $98.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, InterContinental, also known as IHG, sold its 422-room InterContinental Buckhead in Atlanta to <span class="companylink">Pebblebrook Hotel Trust</span> for $105 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Hyatt Hotels Corp</span>. is listing for sale 11 of the 96 hotels it owns, with the intent of using proceeds to acquire hotels in markets where it has little or no presence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts Worldwide Inc</span>., owner of brands such as W and Sheraton, is close to selling its St. Regis Aspen Resort this month to Bangkok-based OptAsia Capital Co., Starwood said. Starwood also has put on the block the Westin Atlanta, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hotels sold by brands in the coming months won't represent a big portion of overall sales of commercial property, because the brands own so little real estate at this point. Starwood owns 62 hotels; Hilton, 46; IHG, 15; Marriott, eight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the hotels the brands do own tend to be large properties in major cities. In many cases, the brands held onto those hotels with the intent of eventually selling them to stable buyers while retaining contracts to manage them for fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why is now considered a good time to sell? Partly because the public markets are relatively optimistic about hotel real estate, boosting prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earnings multiples for hotel owners are trading at a slight premium to those of hotel brands, according to <span class="companylink">Robert W. Baird &amp; Co</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the five largest publicly traded hotel brands, the average 2011 multiple—enterprise value divided by projected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization—is 12.5. For the seven largest REITs, the 2011 multiple is 13.1, according to Baird. The reverse is the norm. Hotel REIT multiples are higher now because the market anticipates REITs will rebound to a greater extent than the brands from the downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've bottomed in the fundamentals, so investors can underwrite [cash-flow projections] with growth" rather than the declines of 2008 and 2009, said Greg Rumpel, executive vice president of brokerage <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, from 2007 to 2009, U.S. hotel occupancy declined 8.2 percentage points, and revenue per room fell 18.3%, according to <span class="companylink">Smith Travel Research</span>. But those trajectories are expected to reverse this year and next. PKF Consulting Inc., a hotel-industry research and advisory company, estimates that, from 2009 to 2011, U.S. occupancy will gain 4.1 percentage points and revenue per room will rise 10.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Predictions of that rebound have lured hotel buyers, most of them REITs flush with cash from recent share sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Pebblebrook Hotel Trust</span>, a REIT formed last year by former <span class="companylink">LaSalle Hotel Properties</span> Chief Executive Jon Bortz, has raised $730 million in two offerings of stock. It has purchased three hotels and has two more under contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bortz, Pebblebrook's chairman, president and CEO, said hotel buyers are banking on "a fairly attractive future" for the industry. "That's leading to prices that are deemed by many [sellers] to be attractive," he said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Deborah Lynn Blumberg   </div><div>608 words</div><div>7 September 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Treasury market is in the middle of a price correction spurred by encouraging economic data, which bodes well for this week's auctions of $67 billion in notes and bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors still uncertain about the path of the economic recovery will be able to take advantage of the price drop to stock up on low-risk Treasurys—$67 billion in three-year, 10-year and 30-year debt—at a discounted price as they wait for more economic reports to help them divine whether the economy will deteriorate later this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is a view that many embraced this summer as economic reports continued to disappoint. Better reports last week, however, have sparked a burgeoning view that perhaps the economy will avoid another tumble, and that Treasury yields—which rise as the price falls—may have bottomed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reports showed the economy lost fewer jobs than anticipated last month, the U.S. factory sector unexpectedly rebounded and U.S. pending home sales rose, beating expectations and offering a glimmer of hope for the lackluster U.S. housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treasury yields were knocked higher as investors sold, a move that many market participants believe will continue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The low rates of this cycle were not sustainable in the absence of a significant deterioration in the U.S. economy that is not likely to unfold," said Ward McCarthy, managing director of the fixed-income division at <span class="companylink">Jefferies &amp; Co</span>. in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is a slow slog," Mr. McCarthy said, about the recovery, "but the economy continues to recover and will continue to do so."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if that is the case, the Federal Reserve is unlikely to step in with more support—namely, another large-scale Treasury-buying program—a step many thought the Fed might have to take. The Fed failing to buy more bonds would push yields even higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late August, the 10-year yield fell to 2.418%, a low last hit in January 2009, from about 4% in April. The two-year Treasury yield dropped to a record low of 0.454%; it was well above 1% in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George Goncalves, managing director and head of U.S. interest-rates strategy in the Americas at <span class="companylink">Nomura Securities International Inc</span>., said the 10-year yield should settle into a 2.67% to 2.78% range this week, from 2.701% Friday, and the two-year in a 0.50% to 0.54% range from 0.517%. Nomura is a primary dealer—one of the elite group of 18 banks that underwrite Treasury auctions and deal directly with the central bank. The bank switched its long-run bullish call on rates this week to an official neutral stance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We still do not think the rise in rates is over," Mr. Goncalves said, noting he believes it is best to sell into market rallies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates have more room to rise, especially ahead of supply, Mr. Goncalves said, with the auctions likely to require higher yields to entice investors who now have a little more hope about the economy. Any support from the government through tax cuts or aid to small businesses would also help push Treasury yields up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bottom line: "We believe that positive shocks on the fiscal side, along with Fed support, should keep us from double-dipping," Mr. Goncalves said, which means the government bond market's days of ultralow yields are likely numbered.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is always a bull market somewhere. With the stock market continuing to whipsaw and bonds getting ever-pricier, investors are looking further afield for decent returns—and some are finding them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Self-storage buildings, anyone? How about abandoned railroad beds, cellular towers, student apartments or parking facilities? Such unglamorous niches, once shunned by the investing elite, are performing well in 2010, even as the Dow industrials limp along.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you haven't heard about these seemingly arcane plays yet, it may be because the smarter money is getting there first. In some cases, private-equity firms, pensions and college endowments, which are cutting their exposure to stocks, are looking into these and other offbeat investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just ask Ken Nitzberg, chairman and chief executive of Devon Self Storage Holdings LLC in Emeryville, Calif. He says he is fielding more calls from investor groups, and has partnered with institutional investors including the State of Michigan Retirement System and <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> Whitehall Funds. He also manages properties for college endowments and high-net-worth families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nitzberg says he got into self-storage in 1993. Initially, "we looked down our noses at it," he says. But after his first venture—the conversion of a strip mall into a self-storage facility—produced a solid return, he was hooked. Since then, while other investors fixated on stocks or more upscale real-estate projects, Mr. Nitzberg has focused on storage. He says the company now owns or operates 48 facilities in 12 states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nitzberg says many of his properties are producing annual returns of 8% to 10%, and a few are exceeding 15%, "which in a 3% Treasury world is pretty good."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investing in storage facilities or parking lots is far harder than, say, trading stocks via an online account. Not only can they be as risky as any other investment—they also tend to be highly illiquid. Buy a property imprudently or manage it poorly and you run the risk of price depreciation, high vacancy rates, property damage or interest-rate jumps on loans—any of which can sink your returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In general, these offbeat commercial-real-estate ventures should be viewed as long-term holdings, not short-term flips—and as alternatives to dividend-paying stocks and bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for income-oriented investors willing to put in the leg work, these properties can generate annual returns of 5% to 9%, say experts. In some cases, they also confer tax advantages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The following examples won't make sense for everyone—but they might help you look at other everyday investment possibilities in a new light:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Student housing. The economy may be cyclical, but "kids are always going to school and parents are going to continue to pay for it," says Peter Katz, senior vice president of investments, national student housing group, at Marcus &amp; Millichap Real Estate Investment Services. That, he says, is what makes this niche of the multifamily housing market somewhat recession-resistant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Purpose built" student-housing developments are basically off-campus apartment complexes. They are a relatively recent phenomenon, with most having been built in the past 15 years, and primarily in the South and Southwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Student housing can be less risky than apartments because parents are usually co-guarantors, reducing the chances of getting stuck with the bill if a student drops out and skips town. Some owners even require a parent's credit-card number.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of new money has come into the sector" in the last 24 to 36 months, says James Tramuto, executive vice president in the real-estate investment-banking practice at <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>'s offices in Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are risks, of course. The biggest: oversupply resulting from a drop in enrollment or a building spike, which could increase vacancies and reduce rents. Student housing also tends to carry higher management and maintenance costs. Those off-campus keggers can do serious damage to stairwells, carpeting and drywall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As with other multifamily properties, older student developments tend to have more upside potential than newer ones because owners can renovate them and boost rents, Mr. Katz says. Such properties can yield 7% to 9% annually, say experts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors can play student housing in several ways. Wealthier folks can develop projects themselves, or join partnerships, and can obtain financing through <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> for up to 75% of the property value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smaller investors can buy publicly traded real-estate investment trusts that focus on the subsector, including <span class="companylink">American Campus Communities Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Education Realty Trust Inc</span>. The latter has produced a total return of 50% this year through Sept. 1, while American Campus has gained 12.5%, compared with a 0.9% drop for the S&amp;P 500, according to investment-research firm <span class="companylink">Morningstar Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs are much more liquid than individual properties because they trade on exchanges like stocks. But they also tend to carry high expenses, and their tax treatment isn't great: A portion of their dividends is taxed as ordinary income, and they are ineligible for the depreciation deduction for real property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small investors can also buy or build single- or multifamily homes near colleges. Real-estate investor Ryan Hinricher says he and partners in 2005 built four rental homes in Memphis, Tenn., close to the University of Tennessee Medical School and a U.S. Navy support facility. He says he paid $185,000 to $190,000 per property, and they are yielding about 10% a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices since have dropped about 18% in the area, he says, "but we invest for income, so we are not betting for prices to rise in a two- or three-year time horizon."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Railroad rights-of-way. Is there gold in them there railbeds?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brent Hayes thought so. Mr. Hayes says he has amassed a fortune of more than $17 million in part by buying abandoned rail lines from <span class="companylink">CSX Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He started his career in the construction business and now specializes in developing distressed properties. In the early 1990s he purchased about 20 miles of abandoned railroad, or 106 acres, near Athens, Ohio, for about $135,000. The draw: its "aggregate," or the crushed rock and gravel between rail ties, which he used in his construction business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But once he removed the rails and cross-ties, he says, he discovered that the surrounding land was worth much more because of improved access. He began selling off parcels to property owners, and kept some for development. He says the Ohio Department of Transportation paid more than $200,000 for seven miles of right-of-way to widen a highway. He also sold off easements for a natural-gas line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was one of the best investments we ever made," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The success enabled him to get bank financing for more acquisitions. Since that first purchase, he has bought about 300 more acres of abandoned railroad rights-of-way, paying about $385,000 all told. Mr. Hayes says he sold one parcel to developers of a medical office building, and another for a Super 8 Motel, among other projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are plenty of other opportunities to buy abandoned railways. Greg Harrison, a software engineer and railroad buff in Fort Worth, Texas, maintains a website, Abandoned Rails.com[http://www.abandonedrails.com/default.aspx], that tracks properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchasing abandoned rail property can be difficult. Investors need to know the area well, and must track down the entity that holds the title, often the real-estate department of a successor company to a defunct railroad. Mr. Hayes says he made dozens of phone calls before locating a CSX official in Jacksonville, Fla., who could authorize the first sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, environmental cleanup work may be necessary, because of diesel fuel or other contamination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Cell-tower leases. Smartphone mania could be presenting opportunities in real estate. Investors who are sizing up commercial properties should also consider their potential as cellphone antennae locations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owners of buildings and hilltop land near interstate highways or on corners in densely populated areas can sometimes squeeze out extra income by leasing the right to cellular companies to erect cell towers on their premises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having an eligible property is a "little like winning the lottery," says Neil S. Levinbook, a New York attorney who specializes in negotiating cell-tower and antenna leases. Monthly rents on the nation's nearly 250,000 towers run up to $3,000 per month, he says, depending on the property. In the best locations, several companies may rent at the same site, says Mr. Levinbook, whose law firm is affiliated with Steel in the Air Inc., a cellphone-tower consulting firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In most cases, the wireless companies approach landowners directly, but people also can apply for consideration through the companies' websites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But be warned: The towers cause additional liabilities and obligations for landlords, including insurance for property damage or personal injury. Another drawback: lease-contract clauses generally give cell-phone companies the right to terminate agreements with just 30 to 90 days notice. Towers also are politically controversial in many communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Parking lots and parking meters. Though the market is highly fragmented, and properties aren't frequently traded, this arcane segment of commercial real-estate is receiving increased attention from private investment groups. Last year, for example, a group led by Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners paid $1.15 billion for the rights to maintain and manage Chicago's 36,000 meters for 75 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The draw? Annual returns for parking lots can be in the 6% to 8% range or more, says Robert Caplin, executive vice president of Next Parking LLC in Northbrook, Ill., which owns and operates facilities in seven states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parking facilities carry other advantages: Owners have the ability to raise rates on short notice (a good hedge against inflation); there is no significant cost to replace tenants; and owners can develop the property into something else if better opportunities arise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are downsides, too. While banks will lend money for parking lot projects, they typically require a 40% down payment. Maintenance and insurance costs can be high. And struggling state and local governments are raising real-estate taxes, which are already high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Self-storage facilities. Believe it or not, almost one in 10 U.S. families rents a storage unit, according to the Self Storage Association, a trade group, up from 1 in 17 in 1995. Near military bases, the demand for space is even greater: military folks can occupy from 20% to 95% of nearby storage units, the association says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All told, last year there were more than 50,000 public storage facilities across the U.S., with $22 billion in sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Costs, meanwhile, are lower than other types of commercial property. Self-storage facilities tend to require a handful of employees and need minimal maintenance. Property taxes, utilities and insurance are the largest expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another plus: tax treatment. Owners can depreciate their costs, so cash flow after covering operating costs and debt service often doesn't result in tax liability in the early years of ownership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The self-storage subsector usually holds up well in recessions. While some people cancel their small-unit leases to save money, sales from bigger units often jump as people who move in with friends or relatives or downsize their homes lease more space to store their belongings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest recession has been tougher on the industry than usual. Stubbornly high unemployment has caused more storage renters to terminate or default on their leases, owners and managers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, occupancy rates have remained fairly strong, particularly in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states, according to Marcus &amp; Millichap, the real-estate investment services company. Rents are rising in some metro areas in the eastern U.S., such as Baltimore and Washington, and even in some Midwestern cities, including Indianapolis, Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio, according to Millichap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are good opportunities for buyers right now," says Charles LeClaire, senior vice president at Millichap. The firm forecasts capitalization rates, or potential return rates, in the 8.5% to 9% range through the end of 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main risk? Barriers to new competition are low, and new rivals can drive down rents in some markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smaller investors can buy mom-and-pop type self-storage units in small towns and cities for $400,000 to $1.5 million through local brokers, Mr. LeClaire says. Big investors, meanwhile, often participate through limited partnerships and private-equity funds. Typically the minimum investment in such arrangements is $2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There also are publicly traded real-estate investment trusts that are big players in the field, including <span class="companylink">Extra Space Storage Inc</span>., Public Storage and <span class="companylink">Sovran Self Storage Inc</span>. Year to date, they have generated total returns of 40.1%, 25.3% and 13%, respectively, according to Morningstar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But self-storage is one commercial-real-estate play that smaller investors can make by themselves. "It is a pretty basic business with not many capital expenditures," says Alan B. Lancz, an investment adviser and real estate investor in Toledo, Ohio. "It is amazing how many people keep paying for units year after year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate investment trusts are eligible to take the depreciation deduction for real-property improvements. This article incorrectly said that REITs were ineligible to take the deduction.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Maya Pope-Chappell    </div><div>1124 words</div><div>4 September 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A20</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)    </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bedford-Stuyvesant real estate, which enjoyed a mini-renaissance during the boom years, has gotten hit especially hard by the downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that means there are more bargains for home buyers, some of them on display in open houses this weekend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While home prices in many parts of the city have rebounded, values there are still scraping along their post-bust lows. The median sales price in East Brooklyn, which includes Bedford-Stuyvesant, fell to $340,000 in the second quarter, down 40% from its peak of $570,000 in the 2006 fourth quarter, according to data compiled by Miller Samuel, a real-estate appraisal firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are also some signs of improvement. Last year, there were 25 foreclosures in Bed-Stuy, down from 57 in 2008, when the area had the second-highest number of foreclosures in Brooklyn, according to New York University's Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though sales in East Brooklyn aren't near the highs the area saw during the good times, volume is picking up, says Jonathan Miller, president and chief executive of Miller Samuel. "East Brooklyn sales activity is up 64%, but the level of sales is still less than half of levels seen during the market peak in late 2006 to mid-2007," Mr. Miller says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The neighborhood dates back to the 1600s, but it was rural until the 19th century. A large African-American community settled in Bed-Stuy around the turn of the century, and the area has remained a center of Brooklyn's black population ever since.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Located in north-central Brooklyn and bordered by Bushwick, Williamsburg, Clinton Hill and Crown Heights, the neighborhood has served as the backdrop for Spike Lee films and has been home to celebrities like Jay Z, Chris Rock and the late Notorious BIG.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Handsome brownstones and townhouses abound in Stuyvesant Heights, the neighborhood's historic district located between Tompkins and Stuyvesant avenues. The landmarked Akwaaba Mansion on MacDonough Street, built in the 1860s, is now a bed and breakfast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks partly to the area's architecture, it attracted a surge of interest when soaring prices in other Brooklyn neighborhoods like Fort Greene and Prospect Heights pushed buyers to look elsewhere. Crystal Bobb-Semple, who grew up in Bed-Stuy and has owned Brownstone Books on Lewis Avenue for 10 years, says that the neighborhood has gotten much younger and more diverse, attracting recent college graduates and young professional families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2000, blacks made up 74.9% of the population while whites made up 2.4% and Asians 0.8%, according to NYU's Furman Center. By 2008, the number of blacks decreased to 63%, while whites accounted for 13.6% of the population and Asians 2.3%. Hispanics have been roughly 19% of the population since 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The first wave of gentrifiers, for the most part, were young black professionals," says Ms. Bobb-Semple. "Over the last maybe five years, that's broadened."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retail, restaurants and night life isn't as vibrant as in other areas of Brooklyn, but the options have expanded with arrivals like the Pilar Cuban Eatery, Therapy Wine Bar, Black Swan, a general store and pharmacy called Tin City and SarahJames, a speakeasy-themed restaurant and bar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commute from Bed-Stuy to Manhattan's Financial District on the neighborhood's main subway lines, A and C, takes under half an hour; to Midtown, the trip is about 30 to 45 minutes. The G train also runs through Bed-Stuy, but a transfer is needed to reach Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the area is safer than it used to be, crime remains an issue. There have been 22 murders, 33 rapes and 466 robberies reported so far this year in Bed-Stuy's 79th and 81st precincts. Some of the area's public schools also are struggling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Schools in Bedford-Stuyvesant are part of districts 13 and 16, which includes P.S. 262 El Hajj Malik El Shabazz Elementary School, M.S. 35 Stephen Decatur and Bedford Academy High School.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2010, which marked the start of new test standards to prepare students for college, 25.2% of students in the eighth grade in District 13 scored proficient on the math exam and 26.5% of students scored proficient on the English Language Arts exam. In 2009, that number was considerably higher under the older test standards with 62.7% of students in the eighth grade scoring proficient in math and 52.3% for reading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In District 16, the number of eighth graders that scored proficient on the math exam was 26.7% and 19.1% on the English Language Arts exam. In 2009, that number was 61.3% in math and 43% in English.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But residents say its improving quality of life and attractive real-estate prices more than make up for its problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's an extremely affordable neighborhood for people who want brownstone Brooklyn but may be priced out of other neighborhoods," says Brown Harris Stevens agent Miriam Sirota, a Bed-Stuy resident. "You can get a gorgeous brownstone for under $1 million."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[The Stock Market May Be Slumping, But Other Investments, From Student Housing To Parking Lots, Are Surging; Managing 'Kegger Risk']</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is always a bull market somewhere. With stocks continuing to whipsaw and bonds getting ever-pricier, investors are looking further afield for decent returns -- and some are finding them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Self-storage buildings, anyone? How about abandoned railroad beds, cellular towers, student apartments or parking facilities? Such unglamorous niches, once shunned by the investing elite, are performing well in 2010, even as the Dow industrials limp along.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you haven't heard about these seemingly arcane plays yet, it may be because the smarter money is getting there first. In some cases, private-equity firms, pensions and college endowments, which are cutting their exposure to stocks, are looking into these and other offbeat investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just ask Ken Nitzberg, chairman and chief executive of Devon Self Storage Holdings LLC in Emeryville, Calif. He says he is fielding more calls from investor groups, and has partnered with institutional investors including the State of Michigan Retirement System and <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> Whitehall Funds. He also manages properties for college endowments and high-net-worth families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nitzberg says he got into self-storage in 1993. Initially, "we looked down our noses at it," he says. But after his first venture -- the conversion of a strip mall into a self-storage facility -- produced a solid return, he was hooked. Since then, while other investors fixated on stocks or more upscale real-estate projects, Mr. Nitzberg has focused on storage. He says the company now owns or operates 48 facilities in 12 states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nitzberg says many of his properties are producing annual returns of 8% to 10%, and a few are exceeding 15%, "which in a 3% Treasury world is pretty good."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investing in storage facilities or parking lots is far harder than, say, trading stocks via an online account. Not only can they be as risky as any other investment -- they also tend to be highly illiquid. Buy a property imprudently or manage it poorly and you run the risk of price depreciation, high vacancy rates, property damage or interest-rate jumps on loans -- any of which can sink your returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In general, these offbeat commercial-real-estate ventures should be viewed as long-term holdings, not short-term flips -- and as alternatives to dividend-paying stocks and bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for income-oriented investors willing to put in the leg work, these properties can generate annual returns of 5% to 9%, say experts. In some cases, they also confer tax advantages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The following examples won't make sense for everyone -- but they might help you look at other everyday investment possibilities in a new light:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Student housing. The economy may be cyclical, but "kids are always going to school and parents are going to continue to pay for it," says Peter Katz, senior vice president of investments, national student housing group, at Marcus &amp; Millichap Real Estate Investment Services. That, he says, is what makes this niche of the multifamily housing market somewhat recession-resistant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Purpose built" student-housing developments are basically off-campus apartment complexes. They are a relatively recent phenomenon, with most having been built in the past 15 years, and primarily in the South and Southwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Student housing can be less risky than apartments because parents are usually co-guarantors, reducing the chances of getting stuck with the bill if a student drops out and skips town. Some owners even require a parent's credit-card number.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of new money has come into the sector" in the last 24 to 36 months, says James Tramuto, executive vice president in the real-estate investment-banking practice at <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>'s offices in Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are risks, of course. The biggest: oversupply resulting from a drop in enrollment or a building spike, which could increase vacancies and reduce rents. Student housing also tends to carry higher management and maintenance costs. Those off-campus keggers can do serious damage to stairwells, carpeting and drywall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As with other multifamily properties, older student developments tend to have more upside potential than newer ones because owners can renovate them and boost rents, Mr. Katz says. Such properties can yield 7% to 9% annually, say experts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors can play student housing in several ways. Wealthier folks can develop projects themselves, or join partnerships, and can obtain financing through <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> for up to 75% of the property value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smaller investors can buy publicly traded real-estate investment trusts that focus on the subsector, including <span class="companylink">American Campus Communities Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Education Realty Trust Inc</span>. The latter has produced a total return of 50% this year through Sept. 1, while American Campus has gained 12.5%, compared with a 0.9% drop for the S&amp;P 500, according to investment-research firm <span class="companylink">Morningstar Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs are much more liquid than individual properties because they trade on exchanges like stocks. But they also tend to carry high expenses, and their tax treatment isn't great: A portion of their dividends is taxed as ordinary income, and they are ineligible for the depreciation deduction for real property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small investors can also buy or build single- or multifamily homes near colleges. Real-estate investor Ryan Hinricher says he and partners in 2005 built four rental homes in Memphis, Tenn., close to the University of Tennessee Medical School and a U.S. Navy support facility. He says he paid $185,000 to $190,000 per property, and they are yielding about 10% a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices since have dropped about 18% in the area, he says, "but we invest for income, so we are not betting for prices to rise in a two- or three-year time horizon."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Railroad rights-of-way. Is there gold in them there railbeds?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owners of buildings and hilltop land near interstate highways or on corners in densely populated areas can sometimes squeeze out extra income by leasing the right to cellular companies to erect cell towers on their premises.</p>

Near military bases, the demand for space is even greater: military folks can occupy from 20% to 95% of nearby storage units, the association says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All told, last year there were more than 50,000 public storage facilities across the U.S., with $22 billion in sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Costs, meanwhile, are lower than other types of commercial property. Self-storage facilities tend to require a handful of employees and need minimal maintenance. Property taxes, utilities and insurance are the largest expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another plus: tax treatment. Owners can depreciate their costs, so cash flow after covering operating costs and debt service often doesn't result in tax liability in the early years of ownership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The self-storage subsector usually holds up well in recessions. While some people cancel their small-unit leases to save money, sales from bigger units often jump as people who move in with friends or relatives or downsize their homes lease more space to store their belongings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest recession has been tougher on the industry than usual. Stubbornly high unemployment has caused more storage renters to terminate or default on their leases, owners and managers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, occupancy rates have remained fairly strong, particularly in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states, according to Marcus &amp; Millichap, the real-estate investment services company. Rents are rising in some metro areas in the eastern U.S., such as Baltimore and Washington, and even in some Midwestern cities, including Indianapolis, Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio, according to Millichap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are good opportunities for buyers right now," says Charles LeClaire, senior vice president at Millichap. The firm forecasts capitalization rates, or potential return rates, in the 8.5% to 9% range through the end of 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main risk? Barriers to new competition are low, and new rivals can drive down rents in some markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smaller investors can buy mom-and-pop type self-storage units in small towns and cities for $400,000 to $1.5 million through local brokers, Mr. LeClaire says. Big investors, meanwhile, often participate through limited partnerships and private-equity funds. Typically the minimum investment in such arrangements is $2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There also are publicly traded real-estate investment trusts that are big players in the field, including <span class="companylink">Extra Space Storage Inc</span>., Public Storage and <span class="companylink">Sovran Self Storage Inc</span>. Year to date, they have generated total returns of 40.1%, 25.3% and 13%, respectively, according to Morningstar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But self-storage is one commercial-real-estate play that smaller investors can make by themselves. "It is a pretty basic business with not many capital expenditures," says Alan B. Lancz, an investment adviser and real estate investor in Toledo, Ohio. "It is amazing how many people keep paying for units year after year."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration's "summer of recovery" has morphed into a summer of economic discontent amid anxiety over the weakening U.S. economy. The greater than 4% growth and less than 8% unemployment envisioned by the president's economic team are nowhere to be seen. Almost everything that is supposed to be up -- the economic growth rate, the stock market, bond yields -- is down. And almost everything that is supposed to be down -- unemployment-insurance claims, new mortgage delinquencies -- is up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes a weak early recovery gathers strength after a year or so, as in 2003 when the second round of the Bush tax cuts helped double growth to 3.8% from 1.9%. But there are serious headwinds to stronger growth: household deleveraging, unresolved toxic assets, and most government economic policies headed in the wrong direction. While the base case outlook is still slow recovery, a double-dip recession or a Japanese-style lost decade is more plausible than a few months ago. This explains why Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke felt compelled last week to reiterate that the Fed will use more of its (in my view, weak) ammunition should the economy falter further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How bad is it? Despite the good news that manufacturing improved in August, according to the Institute of Supply Management, most of the recent data are negative. In the last few weeks and months, real personal disposable income was flat; core capital goods orders, a precursor of business capital spending, declined 8%; new home sales fell 12.4%, existing sales 27%, despite record low mortgage rates; single-family housing starts declined 4.2%; building permits, foreshadowing future construction, fell 1.2%; initial jobless claims spiked to over 500,000, leading forecasters to expect at best meager short-term private-sector job growth; the Kansas City, Philadelphia and New York Fed manufacturing indexes fell; and the trade deficit increased, as exports fell and imports rose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These weak backward-looking data were accompanied by big downdrafts in forward-looking financial markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost over 4% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq over 6% in August. The 10-year U.S. bond yield, at 2.47%, was back to its lows of March 2009. Real GDP growth slowed to just 1.6% last quarter from 3.7% in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worse yet, much of the growth in the first half of 2010 was due to inventory-rebuilding; real final sales grew at only about 1%. Consumers are cautious, saving and paying down debt. The surge in government spending is abating. Global trade, dependent on growth abroad, is slowing: Japan is stalled, China slowing, and despite Germany's strong quarter, eurozone growth is projected to be only half America's modest rate through 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sluggish growth is particularly disconcerting compared to the usual strong growth following deep recessions. Compared to the 6.2% first-year Ford recovery and 7.7% Reagan recovery, the Obama recovery at 3% is less than half speed. If the Obama recovery continues at 3%, the president will be running for election in mid-2012 with a cumulative GDP recovery shortfall of 4.5% (relative to Ford) to 8.4% (relative to Reagan).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Reagan won re-election with 49 states. President Ford came from 30 points back to lose narrowly to Jimmy Carter, and would have won easily were the election a few months later. What does this say about an Obama second term? With little discernible improvement in the economy from the president's $862 billion in fiscal stimulus, citizens are revolting against the explosion of spending, deficits, higher taxes, government bailouts and economic micromanagement, and seem poised to put an exclamation mark on it in the November elections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not surprisingly, the left is frantically calling for a second "stimulus" and demanding tax hikes for the "rich" -- a.k.a. our most productive citizens and small businesses. The rehashed ideas include such nonsense as massive infrastructure spending financed by a national infrastructure bank, an old Carter idea; yet more aid to the states; and even that worst of ideas, "general revenue sharing," which would force citizens to pay future federal taxes to fund the debt used just to send revenue back to their states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These ideas would do a lot more harm than good. To paraphrase Benjamin Franklin, we have the best economic system among the advanced economies, "if we can keep it." That will require fundamental policy changes, not doubling down on the failed big government experiment of recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The president and Congress would have to implement serious spending reductions, real entitlement reform focused on substantially slowing the growth of benefits per recipient, and no tax hikes. President Clinton made a major move back to the political center -- to his own and the nation's benefit -- when Republicans won control of Congress in 1994. In partnership, they balanced the budget and reformed welfare. But recall, President Clinton's major big-government initiative -- HillaryCare -- was defeated. For President Obama to get to a similar place after the midterm elections, he would have to partner in "repealing and replacing" his signature initiatives.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fewer workers filed new claims for unemployment benefits last week, the second week in a row such claims declined and a rare bright spot in an otherwise grim job market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial jobless claims fell 6,000 to 472,000 in the week ended Saturday, the Labor Department said Thursday. Several other reports released Thursday were also positive, including one that showed the number of buyers who signed contracts to buy previously occupied homes increased, and another that reported factory orders ticked up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. economy still faces stiff headwinds, including a deeply depressed housing market and concerns that economic growth will slow in months ahead. Michelle Girard, an analyst at RBS Securities Inc., said the latest reports showed "sluggish but sustained growth."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the drop in jobless claims was a positive sign, the rate of claims remained elevated. The four-week moving average, which aims to smooth volatility in the data, fell 2,500 to 485,500. Continuing claims, which are drawn by workers for more than a week, fell 23,000 to 4.5 million for the week ended Aug. 21.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employers have largely held off from hiring, opting to find ways to produce more from current workers. But it appeared businesses were close to exhausting that strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Productivity declined 1.8% in the nonfarm business sector in the second quarter, the Labor Department said Thursday. The department had previously estimated productivity fell 0.9%. The second quarter marked the first productivity drop after five quarters of increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Productivity, a measure of output per hour, declined as output increased 1.6%, less than the 2.6% previously estimated, as a result of slower economic growth in the second quarter. Hours worked were roughly unchanged, rising 3.5%. Unit labor costs rose 1.1%, more than the previously reported 0.2% increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New orders for factory goods also resumed growing in July, rising 0.1% to $409.5 billion following two months of declines, the Commerce Department said. Orders for durable goods, designed to last at least three years, increased 0.4%. Nondurable-goods orders fell slightly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pending home sales index rose 5.2% in July to 79.4, according to a report Thursday from the National Association of Realtors. That was an improvement, but economists noted housing sales remained deeply depressed.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Productivity, a measure of output per hour, registered a larger decline than in the prior estimate because output growth wasn't as robust.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturing has led the way in the recovery, while the housing sector has been a weak spot.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending home sales declined in the previous two months, falling 29.9% in May and 2.8% in June, after the government's homebuyer tax credit expired at the end of April.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growth in manufacturing activity accelerated last month in both the U.S. and China, defying mounting signs of a global slowdown and cheering investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management, which surveys U.S. purchasing managers, said Wednesday its manufacturing index rose to 56.3 in August from 55.5 the prior month. A parallel index in China clicked up to 51.7 from 51.2 in the same period, while indexes in Europe slid. Any reading over 50 indicates expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. economy faces stiff headwinds, including a slumping housing market and high joblessness. But the upbeat reports from U.S. and Chinese factories sent stocks surging. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 254.75, or 2.5%, to 10269.47. The reports lifted sentiment in early Asian trading Thursday, with Japan's Nikkei Stock Average gaining 1.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is very good news" for both the U.S. and global recoveries, said Brian Bethune, an IHS Global Insight economist. While there are signs the recovery has slowed, he said, the factory numbers show it hasn't stalled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enthusiasm over the U.S. and Chinese reports pushed aside concerns about a downbeat U.S. employment report: Private-sector payrolls dropped overall by 10,000 last month, according to an estimate by <span class="companylink">Automatic Data Processing Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The payroll firm's report with economic-consulting firm <span class="companylink">Macroeconomic Advisers</span> showed goods-producing companies cut 40,000 jobs, more than offsetting the 30,000 jobs created by service companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Faster growth in production, employment, inventories and imports pushed the U.S. manufacturing index higher last month. Some of the strength likely came from improved performance in the auto industry, analysts said. Many auto factories didn't scale back as much this summer as they normally do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many manufacturers remained cautious as they waited for clearer signs that the recovery won't falter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Furniture Brands International Inc</span>., a St. Louis-based furniture maker that produces in both the U.S. and Asia, is still focused on improving efficiency at its U.S. operations, not expanding them. During the current housing slump, the company went from operating 19 U.S. plants to 15. We're going to have a recovery," said Ralph Scozzafava, the company's chief executive, but "it's going to look like a zig-zag line with a positive slope at the end of the day."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Furniture Brands</span> expects its capital spending to roughly triple this year compared with 2009, to between $25 million and $30 million. But much of that will go toward a major expansion in Indonesia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the manufacturing sector's recovery is closely tied to global growth, especially in Asia. Economists have grown worried that a recent slowdown there would cascade through the global production system -- with diminished demand from China leading to downturns for producers of raw materials and equipment in many advanced economies, including the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That helps explain why investors around the world welcomed news that China's official Purchasing Managers Index rose following three straight months of declines. <span class="companylink">HSBC</span> economist Qu Hongbin said the reading confirmed that "China is moderating rather than melting down."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Joy Global Inc</span>. was among those counting on growth in Asia to continue. The Milwaukee-based maker of mining equipment reported Wednesday its net income for the quarter ended July 30 fell 4.7% from a year earlier, but the company raised its profit outlook for the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"China continues to be a good [growth] story," said Joy CEO Mike Sutherlin, who was encouraged by Chinese government efforts to expand electricity production in rural areas. Despite talk of a double-dip recession in the U.S., Joy's customers around the world are generally showing a greater sense of urgency about capital spending than they did six months ago, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, the global outlook for manufacturing is mixed. Growth in the U.K.'s manufacturing sector slowed sharply in August, while manufacturing growth in the euro zone slowed to its weakest pace in six months, according to Markit Economics and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply. The euro zone index dropped to 55.1 in August from 56.7 in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S., the manufacturing rebound still wasn't bringing work forces back to pre-recession levels. Justin McElhattan, CEO of <span class="companylink">Industrial Scientific Corp</span>. in Pittsburgh, said orders for the company's gas-detection devices, used to protect workers in energy, mining and other industries, began rebounding from the recession in the fourth quarter of 2009 and business has been "solid" since then, with no sign of a renewed downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the recession, the company trimmed its global staff to about 800 from 860, but it began hiring again in this year's first quarter and is likely to end the year at around 825, Mr. McElhattan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report Wednesday highlighted the challenges facing the U.S. construction industry: Construction spending fell 1% in July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $805.2 billion, the Commerce Department said. Spending was 10.7% below year-earlier levels.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jane Hodges </div><div>1289 words</div><div>2 September 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C10</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Making money in real estate? Surprising but true.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite continued bad news about the economy and real estate's role in it, mutual funds and exchange-traded funds in the real-estate sector have rebounded during the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, real estate has been the top-performing U.S.-stock fund category this year, through August, with a 13.7% total return, according to <span class="companylink">Morningstar Inc</span>., compared with a negative 4.6% for the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span> 500-stock index over the same period. Real estate is the winning category for the past 12 months as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But will the strong performance continue? A lot depends on how the economy fares. Over the past month or two, economists and government officials have expressed concern that the recovery is stalling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Real estate is a leveraged play on the U.S. economy," says Timothy Strauts, an ETF analyst with Morningstar. "If we go back into a recession, real estate will fare worse" than the broad stock market, but if the economy "continues to slowly grow, real estate will continue to lead," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate funds typically invest in commercial real estate and multifamily, not single-family, housing. They also tend to concentrate on real-estate investment trusts, or REITs, which own stakes in office, industrial, storage, retail, hospitality and apartment properties, as well as related service companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across these different sectors, signals are decidedly mixed. Christopher Cornell, an economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics, says his company's data suggest commercial real estate is essentially flat right now. The company's commercial real-estate index as of June was down roughly 41% from its peak in October 2007, but was up 4.2% from its all-time low set in October 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retail is faring worst among the areas that make up commercial real estate, he says. <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> retail index for the second quarter fell 11% from the first period, and was down 14% from a year earlier, hurt by lackluster consumer spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartment properties, however, were up 4% on a quarter-to-quarter basis and 2.5% year over year, as home seekers decided to rent rather than own. Office space, too, showed a 4% gain between quarters, but was down 4.7% year over year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To Mr. Cornell, the overall data point to "a recovery story."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A second-quarter survey of institutional investors by <span class="companylink">PricewaterhouseCoopers</span> and Korpacz Realty Advisors tells a similar story. The respondents said they regarded commercial real estate as still lagging behind a broader U.S. economic recovery. The report forecasts continuing weakness in retail real estate into next year due to elevated vacancy rates, low lease prices and reduced consumer confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But self-storage, medical and apartment markets are showing strength, the report says, and the warehouse market, though soft, has improved as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past, conventional wisdom held that real-estate holdings ran countercyclically to the broader economic cycle, and that it was wise to devote from 5% to 15% of an investor's portfolio to the sector. Many financial advisers still recommend a holding in the low end of that range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Teresa Jacobsen, an adviser and certified public accountant at UBS Financial Services in Stamford, Conn., recommends "modest exposure" to real estate, no more than 5% for aggressive investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Rick Ashburn, an adviser and principal at Creekside Partners in Lafayette, Calif., says he currently doesn't recommend holding any real-estate funds, ETFs or REITs. Investors with the stomach for it, he says, should buy properties directly when they promise at least an 8% return. He says his firm "will make the occasional industry bet, but only if there is a compelling cheap opportunity" -- and he says real-estate stocks don't qualify after their recent gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For anyone considering adding real estate to a portfolio of funds, there are plenty of options: Morningstar counts about 75 domestic real-estate mutual funds. Among ETFs, there are 15 domestic real-estate options.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What you want is an investment diversified across the REIT space," says Brenda Wenning, of Wenning Investments in Newton, Mass., who recommends about a 10% allocation in real estate. "You want apartments, storage, other baskets of real-estate securities," she says. She suggests two ETFs: <span class="companylink">iShares Cohen &amp;Steers Realty Majors</span> and iShares Dow Jones US Real Estate. Both contain a mix of mall, storage, hospitality, health-care, apartment and other real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Jacobsen, the <span class="companylink">UBS</span> adviser, says Pimco Real Estate Real Return Strategy appeals to her for its strong performance over one-, three- and five-year periods: 54%, negative 1.1% annualized and 2.5% annualized, respectively. But the fund's use of derivatives, she says, may be inappropriate for investors unfamiliar with them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrew Gogerty, a fund analyst at Morningstar, is recommending <span class="companylink">T. Rowe Price Real Estate</span> and J. P. Morgan U.S. Real Estate. He likes the former for its careful selection of larger real-estate stocks, such as <span class="companylink">Simon Property Group</span>, <span class="companylink">AvalonBay Communities</span> and Public Storage. He likes the <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> fund for its subsectors, such as malls, apartments, storage, health care and hotels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among ETFs, only iShares FTSE NAREIT Residential Plus Capped Index holds a five-star rating from Morningstar. Mr. Strauts likes the fund's concentration on rental housing and storage, given the distressed residential housing market. It's also loaded up on health care, which Mr. Strauts says is somewhat immune to downturns. As of Aug. 30, the fund had 46% of assets in apartments, 37% in health care, 15% in storage, and the rest in manufactured homes or other holdings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Strauts finds the ETF's three-year annualized return of negative 1.5% impressive compared with declines of 10% or more over the same period for iShares' three other domestic real-estate sector ETFs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another option: real-estate funds that look past U.S. borders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of July 31, the global real-estate funds tracked by Morningstar had an average 12-month yield of 6.3%, more than double the average 2.9% yield of U.S. real-estate funds. Over time, the dividend income is typically "the majority of your return if you're holding money in REITs," says John Coumarianos, a fund analyst at Morningstar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But international real estate has been on a wild ride in recent years. After surging in the early part of the past decade, the category plummeted 60% from the beginning of 2008 through February 2009. Then it roared back 88% from March 2009 through July 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Global real-estate funds contain REITs with less of a debt burden than U.S.-based REITs and they invest in new markets that still promise future gains, says Mr. Coumarianos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among global funds, he currently recommends Third Avenue Real Estate Value. It has more than 20% in cash and invests mainly in Asian real-estate developers. It also holds some distressed debt. But some Asian countries, he says, have resolved a recent debt crisis and are carrying less debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morningstar tracks 11 international real-estate ETFs. Mr. Strauts recommends iShares FTSE EPRA/NAREIT Developed Europe Index, which is concentrated in Britain and France, and iShares FTSE EPRA/NAREIT Developed Asia Index, with holdings in Hong Kong, Japan, Australia, Singapore, and China. Another option: SPDR Dow Jones International Real Estate, containing a mix of Asian and European assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These are interesting investments," Mr. Strauts says, "and they get you out of the U.S."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fewer workers filed new claims for unemployment benefits last week, the second week in a row such claims declined and a rare bright spot in an otherwise grim job market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial jobless claims fell 6,000 to 472,000 in the week ended Saturday, the Labor Department said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several other reports released Thursday were also positive, including one that showed the number of buyers who signed contracts to buy previously occupied homes increased in July, and another that reported factory orders ticked up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy still faces stiff headwinds, including a deeply depressed housing market and concerns that economic growth will slow in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michelle Girard, an analyst at RBS Securities Inc., said the latest reports showed "sluggish but sustained growth."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the drop in unemployment claims was a positive sign for the job market, the rate of claims remained elevated. The four-week moving average, which aims to smooth volatility in the data, fell 2,500 to 485,500. Continuing claims, which are drawn by workers for more than one week, declined 23,000 to 4.5 million for the week ended Aug. 21.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employers have largely held off from hiring, opting instead to find ways to produce more from current workers. But it appeared businesses were close to exhausting that strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Productivity declined 1.8% in the nonfarm business sector in the second quarter, the Labor Department said Thursday, after previously estimating a decline of 0.9%. The second quarter marked the first productivity drop after five quarters of increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Productivity, a measure of output per hour, registered a larger decline than in the prior estimate because output growth wasn't as robust. Output increased 1.6%, less than the 2.6% in the original estimate, as the economy grew at a slower pace in the second quarter. Hours worked were roughly unchanged, increasing 3.5%. And unit labor costs rose 1.1%, more than the previously reported 0.2% increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New orders for factory goods also resumed growing in July, rising 0.1% to $409.5 billion following two months of declines, the Commerce Department said. Orders for durable goods, designed to last at least three years, increased 0.4%. Nondurable goods orders fell slightly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturing has led the way in the recovery, while the housing sector has been a weak spot. The pending home sales index rose 5.2% to 79.4 in July, compared with 75.5 in June, according to a report Thursday from the National Association of Realtors. That was an improvement, but economists noted housing sales remained deeply depressed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending home sales declined in the previous two months, falling 29.9% in May and 2.8% in June, after the government's homebuyer tax credit expired at the end of April. The latest report indicated the housing market was beginning to stabilize at very low levels.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Summer of Economic Discontent; The administration's 'summer of recovery' has fizzled in almost every way imaginable. The growth rate is less than half what it was at this stage after the 1974-75 and 1981-82 recessions.</span>
</div><div class="author">By Michael Boskin   </div><div>1004 words</div><div>2 September 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration's "summer of recovery" has morphed into a summer of economic discontent amid anxiety over the weakening economy. The greater than 4% growth and less than 8% unemployment envisioned by the president's economic team are nowhere to be seen. Almost everything that is supposed to be up—the economic growth rate, the stock market, bond yields—is down. And almost everything that is supposed to be down—unemployment-insurance claims, new mortgage delinquencies—is up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes a weak early recovery gathers strength after a year or so, as in 2003 when the second round of the Bush tax cuts helped double growth to 3.8% from 1.9%. But there are serious headwinds to stronger growth: household deleveraging, unresolved toxic assets, and most government economic policies headed in the wrong direction. While the base case outlook is still slow recovery, a double-dip recession or a Japanese-style lost decade is more plausible than a few months ago. This explains why Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke felt compelled last week to reiterate that the Fed will use more of its (in my view, weak) ammunition should the economy falter further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How bad is it? In the data for the last few weeks and months, real personal disposable income was flat; core capital goods orders, a precursor of business capital spending, declined 8%; new home sales fell 12.4%, existing sales 27%, despite record low mortgage rates; single-family housing starts declined 4.2%; building permits, foreshadowing future construction, fell 1.2%; initial jobless claims spiked to over 500,000, leading forecasters to expect at best meager short-term private-sector job growth; the Kansas City, Philadelphia and New York Fed manufacturing indexes fell; and the trade deficit increased, as exports fell and imports rose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These weak backward-looking data were accompanied by big downdrafts in forward-looking financial markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost over 4% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq over 6% in August—partly retraced yesterday—and the 10-year U.S. bond yield, at 2.47%, was back to its lows of March 2009. Real GDP growth slowed from 3.7% in the first quarter to just 1.6% last quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worse yet, much of the growth in the first half of 2010 was due to inventory-rebuilding; real final sales grew at only about 1%. Consumers are cautious, saving and paying down debt. The surge in government spending is abating. Global trade, dependent on growth abroad, is slowing: Japan is stalled, China slowing, and despite Germany's strong quarter, eurozone growth is projected to be only half America's modest rate through 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The one bright spot has been the rebound in business capital spending. Businesses are flush with cash and profits have been solid. But the weak core durable goods report, the manufacturing downshift, and continued uncertainty about the economy and the Obama administration's economic policy have many forecasters reducing capital expenditure projections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sluggish growth is particularly disconcerting compared to the usual strong growth following deep recessions. The chart nearby shows the average real growth that occurred in the first four and first 12 quarters following the severe recessions of 1974-75 and 1981-82. Compared to the 6.2% first-year Ford recovery and 7.7% Reagan recovery, the Obama recovery at 3% is less than half speed. The unemployment rate would now be 8% or lower at those higher growth rates. If the Obama recovery continues at 3%, the president will be running for election in mid-2012 with a cumulative GDP recovery shortfall of 4.5% (relative to Ford) to 8.4% (relative to Reagan).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Reagan won re-election with 49 states. President Ford came from 30 points back to lose narrowly to Jimmy Carter, and would have won easily were the election a few months later. What does this say about an Obama second term? With little discernible improvement in the economy from the president's $862 billion in fiscal stimulus, citizens are revolting against the explosion of spending, deficits, higher taxes, government bailouts and economic micromanagement, and seem poised to put an exclamation mark on it in the November elections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not surprisingly, the left is frantically calling for a second "stimulus" and demanding tax hikes for the "rich"—a.k.a. our most productive citizens and small businesses. The rehashed ideas include such nonsense as massive infrastructure spending financed by a national infrastructure bank, an old Carter idea; yet more aid to the states; and even that worst of ideas, "general revenue sharing," which would force citizens to pay future federal taxes to fund the debt used just to send revenue back to their states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These ideas would do a lot more harm than good. To paraphrase Benjamin Franklin, we have the best economic system among the advanced economies, "if we can keep it." That will require fundamental policy changes, not doubling down on the failed big government experiment of recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The president and Congress would have to implement serious spending reductions, real entitlement reform focused on substantially slowing the growth of benefits per recipient, and no tax hikes. President Clinton made a major move back to the political center—to his own and the nation's benefit—when Republicans won control of Congress in 1994. In partnership, they balanced the budget and reformed welfare. But recall, President Clinton's major big-government initiative—HillaryCare—was defeated. For President Obama to get to a similar place after the midterm elections, he would have to partner in "repealing and replacing" his signature initiatives.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private businesses in the U.S. laid off workers in August as only large companies hired last month, according to data released Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the U.S. manufacturing sector unexpectedly rebounded in August, with employment rising strongly, according to the Institute for Supply Management. But in another negative sign, a separate report noted a drop in July construction spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private-sector jobs in the U.S. fell by 10,000 last month, according to a national employment report published by payroll giant <span class="companylink">Automatic Data Processing Inc</span>. and consultancy <span class="companylink">Macroeconomic Advisers</span>. Economists had expected ADP to report a jobs gain of 17,000 in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ADP survey tallies only private-sector jobs, while the Bureau of Labor Statistics' nonfarm payroll data, to be released Friday, include government workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Reserve officials discussing the reasons for the lack of strong job growth at the Aug. 10 Open Market Committee meeting listed business concerns on regulations, taxes and future health-care costs, plus job mismatch. But the primary deterrent seemed to be the lack of demand, according to the minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the ISM's manufacturing purchasing managers' index rose to 56.3 in August, from 55.5 in July. Readings above 50 indicate expanding activity, and August was the 13th consecutive month of growth, said the ISM.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Factory employment strengthened. The index stood at 60.4 from 58.6 in July. The ISM report contrasts sharply with the ADP private payroll survey that indicated manufacturers cut 6,000 last month.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'Desi Food Truck' owner</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">seeks New York niche</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While New York City offers a considerable variety of Indian restaurants, the mobile food truck is mostly associated with falafel, shawarma, tacos, and ice cream. Apart from the dosa cart at the New York University campus in downtown Manhattan, few South Asian mobile food vendors have captured the imagination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alamgeer Elahi hopes to change that. Walk down Fifth Avenue and, at the intersection of 27th Street, it's hard to miss a yellow van plastered with posters of Bollywood stars and surrounded by the unmistakable whiff of fresh lachha parathas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anand Kumar, 31, who works at a technology firm in Jersey City, had just bought himself a Kolkata biryani on a Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've had the kati roll here before and it's phenomenal," says Mr. Kumar, who is a second-generation Indian living in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Elahi says a "significant" number of non-Indians also frequent the truck, which he started operating in July and calls Desi Food Truck. The word "desi," used by many South Asians, means "of one's country."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Elahi is in his 40s and originally from the eastern Indian city of Kolkata, where his parents moved from Pakistani Punjab. He has lived in New York City for 18 years, during which time he has dabbled in the mobile-phone business, real estate and food. Apart from managing the truck, he's also a one-man marketing department, coaxing passersby to sample "authentic Indian delicacies."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Food carts are a competitive business and the economics can be tricky. Mr. Elahi worries he has underpriced himself -- the kati rolls cost $4 compared with the $4.75 charged by the established Kati Roll Company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We opened on July 4 and haven't broken even yet," he said. "So I may increase the price in the next few months."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mumbai's millionaires migrate north</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of Mumbai's millionaires are moving up in life, as a flood of posh new apartment towers draw them out of the neighborhoods in the city's well-heeled south, full of colonial-era buildings and old money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly 3,500 luxury apartments priced at $1 million or more are under construction in Mumbai, estimates real-estate consulting firm <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>. That includes duplexes, penthouses and four bedroom apartments, ranging from 2,000 to 10,000 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since this waterlocked city has limited space, most of the new construction is vertical, with developers planning 40 to 117-story apartment buildings. An estimated nine million to 10 million square feet is under construction for luxury apartments, says <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>. Some of this space will be dedicated to luxuries like temperature-controlled swimming pools and large gyms as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These homes are being bought mainly by businessmen and top executives, said Mrunal Duggar, vice president of Homebay Residential, a unit of <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>. But many of Mumbai's old money families are also buying or building the flats to move their large, extended families to larger, more modern digs, says Ms. Duggar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The largest number of luxury apartments is coming up in the middle of town in the Lower Parel neighborhood, largely on land that used to be occupied by bankrupt textile mills. Other pockets for fancy flat construction are Mahalaxmi, Bandra, and Juhu, once a favorite getaway for Bollywood stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the far suburbs are getting in on the action. Developers such as Oberoi Realty Ltd. are working on 45- to 60-floor apartment towers in the northwestern suburb of Goregaon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a Goregaon address might have been socially embarrassing to some Mumbaikars in the past, the apartments are expected to sell for 10,000 rupees ($214) to 14,500 rupees ($310) per square foot, previously unheard of levels for that neighborhood.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate funds saddled with tens of billions of dollars of boom-time properties are beginning to get some relief from Wall Street firms and other investors hoping to capitalize on their need for cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opportunistic investors are buying stakes in troubled funds at steep discounts or lending the funds money in deals that give them a steady return and potentially a share in the profit if real-estate markets rebound. At the same time, some funds are succeeding in persuading existing investors to cough up more capital, although this typically is an uphill struggle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the latest deal, Clairvue Capital Partners, founded early this year with $250 million from <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>.'s private-equity group, is set to announce Wednesday that it made a $60 million credit line to a $450 million real-estate fund closed in 2006 by Normandy Real Estate Partners. Earlier this year, a $1.2 billion fund run by <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span> affiliate CB Richard Ellis Investors got a cash infusion, totaling $55 million, from <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co</span>. to recapitalize a $500 million portfolio of office buildings, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These deals are the latest sign the capital freeze plaguing the commercial-real-estate industry since the global financial downturn is beginning to thaw. For two years, property owners have refrained from selling to avoid realizing losses. But in recent weeks, some banks also have shown an increasing willingness to sell distressed assets at discounted prices because their balance sheets have stabilized and values have bounced back from their lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pickup in deal making also is a reflection of widespread uncertainty over the direction of the economy. Some owners are eager to recapitalize now for fear that a double-dip recession could send values plummeting again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate funds are a particularly needy bunch. By some estimates, about 80% -- or $335 billion -- of the $420 billion amassed in the U.S. by real-estate funds since 1999 was raised from 2005 to 2008, the height of the market. And the money was spent quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, amid depressed property values and maturing loans, a total of 40 private-equity real-estate funds have gone back to their investors for additional capital since last year, according to Townsend Group, which invests on behalf of institutional clients. But only a handful, including funds run by <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank AG</span> and Stockbridge Real Estate Funds -- have been successful, as existing fund investors like pension funds and college endowments worry about throwing good money after bad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It took more than a year for the $1.6 billion fund run by <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>'s real-estate-investment unit, named RREEF, to line up $100 million of additional capital from its investors, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A disclosure made by Pennsylvania's Public School Employees' Retirement System provides a window into the desperate needs for cash by some fund managers and the kind of hefty rates that usually come with the extra funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to a presentation made to the board of the retirement system on Aug. 11, a $1 billion fund operated by Stockbridge Real Estate Funds "is facing significant loan maturity and fund-level liquidity issues" and likely "would be forced to abandon or liquidate many of its assets" absent the injection of new capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The staff of the retirement system, which had an original commitment of $162.5 million to the fund, recommended it contribute another $20.3 million as part of a $125 million credit line to the fund. The annual interest rate on the new money: 25%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But most real-estate funds haven't been able to raise additional capital from investors, nor do they have any remaining promises that investors made to provide additional money in the future, or "uncalled commitments." That gives Wall Street firms leverage to be opportunistic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without the ability to tap existing investors, "they are stuck," says Jeffrey Giller, managing partner and chief investment officer at Clairvue Capital Partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some investors are simply buying stakes in funds from institutions that have resigned themselves to cashing out at a discounted price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others are making deals with the funds directly. In the <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> recapitalization of the <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span> portfolio, the bank injected $55 million in capital and, in exchange, got preferred equity in six buildings in the portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of capital is lining up to take advantage of the opportunity" to recapitalize property funds, says Anthony Frammartino, a principal of Townsend, of Cleveland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Clairvue fund backed by Goldman was set up in April to provide capital to help restructure real-estate funds. The loan to Normandy is its first deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Normandy fund, which has holdings that include the Indigo Hotel and two Summer Street office buildings in Boston, purchased most of its properties near the peak of the market and will use the money primarily to buy back its existing debt at discounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeff Cronning, managing principal of Normandy, predicted in a statement that the increase in the fund's return from the new capital will be greater than the cost of the capital.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We should have eaten those toxic assets instead of sweeping them under the carpet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) was a foolish bait and switch. To prevent the 2008 financial crisis from worsening, TARP was originally designed to buy toxic mortgage derivatives weighing down banks and Wall Street, but no one could decide what price to pay for them. Too high and TARP would look like a government handout. But if the Treasury paid what they were worth, which was not much, financial firms would have to take huge write-offs, forcing many of them into insolvency and even nationalization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson switched plans, investing TARP funds directly into banks for a piece of equity. The idea was that banks would "earn out" their toxic portfolio -- i.e., slowly write them off against the profits gained by the Federal Reserve's zero interest rate policy. It was a bold bet that the Treasury and Fed could engineer an economic recovery without allowing the bottoming action of a sharp but swift repricing of the U.S. housing stock. It turns out they only bought time, not a recovery, and now we are paying for that mistake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite all efforts, the deleveraging continues. The $862 billion Congressional stimulus didn't stimulate the economy because it went into unproductive projects. The Fed's $1.4 trillion quantitative easing/dollar printing sent 30-year mortgage rates to record lows, but not enough people are buying homes because home prices haven't fallen enough to clear the inventory. And with 9.5% unemployment and 18.4% underemployed, there are more sellers than buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales dropped 27% from a year ago July to a 3.83 million annual rate, which was blamed on the May expiration of the $8,000 home buyer's tax credit.

As late as 2005, home inventory was just 2.5 million. Using that as a baseline or normal number, there are now around 1.5 million "extra" homes on the market that are not selling and either empty or soon to be foreclosed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And those toxic mortgage assets?

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We should have eaten those toxic assets instead of sweeping them under the carpet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) was a foolish bait and switch. To prevent the 2008 financial crisis from worsening, TARP was originally designed to buy toxic mortgage derivatives weighing down banks and Wall Street, but no one could decide what price to pay for them. Too high and TARP would look like a government handout. But if the Treasury paid what they were worth, which was not much, financial firms would have to take huge write-offs, forcing many of them into insolvency and even nationalization.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the American Enterprise Institute</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dominant theme of the 2,300-page Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is fear of instability and change, which the act suppresses by subjecting the largest financial firms to banklike regulation. The competitiveness, innovativeness, and risk taking that have always characterized U.S. financial firms will, under this new structure, inevitably be subordinated to supervisory judgments about what these firms can safely be allowed to do. But the worst element of this system is that the extraordinary power given to regulators--and particularly the Federal Reserve--is likely to change the nature of the U.S. financial system. Where financial firms once focused on beating their competitors, they will now focus on currying favor with their regulator, which will have the power to control their every move. What may ultimately emerge is a partnership between the largest financial firms and the Federal Reserve--a partnership in which the Fed protects them from failure and excessive competition and they in turn curb their competitive instincts to carry out the government's policies and directions. In addition, with the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the act abandons a fundamental principle of the U.S. Constitution, in which Congress retains the power to control the agencies of the executive branch. These wholesale changes in traditional relationships are hard to explain except as the triumph of a fundamentally different view--a corporatist political model more characteristic of Europe--of the government's role in the U.S. economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Key points in this Outlook:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">•The Dodd-Frank Act gives the Federal Reserve, under light supervision by a council of regulators, unprecedented control over the largest firms in the U.S. financial system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">•The result may be a public-private partnership, in which the Fed protects the largest firms from excessive competition and failure and they in turn follow the government's directions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">•In the interest of protecting consumers, the act sacrifices the basic protections built into the U.S. Constitution, creating an agency--the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau--that is answerable to no one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">•Ultimately, the act's effort to suppress risk taking will result in a decline in U.S. competitiveness, innovation, and economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My mother always told me that what's done is done, and there's no sense worrying about decisions that cannot be changed. Still, it is useful to put down some markers about the recently adopted Dodd-Frank Act (DFA), which looks to be the most troubling--maybe even destructive--single piece of financial legislation ever adopted. The reason markers are useful is that they alert observers--especially those in Congress with the power to do something about it--to the problems they should be looking for in the future. And they might even alert regulators--charged with implementing the legislation--to the dangers of taking full advantage of what Congress has offered them. Given these objectives, this Outlook will discuss the most serious policy problems implicit in the DFA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regulation to Prevent "Instability"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is probably the heart of the act, which was sold on the claim that it would prevent the recurrence of a financial crisis. As might be expected, one can find in the solution the germ of the putative cause. Some see this cause as the free-market system itself; others see it as a failure of regulators--with powers already in place--who did not take the necessary actions to prevent the crisis. The DFA comes down somewhere between the two. If the Democrats in Congress who wrote the law had believed that the cause was entirely regulatory failure, they would have revised the regulatory structure, not given yet more power to exactly the same regulators. The fact that they saw expanded regulation as a suitable remedy indicates that they believed the free-market system needed greater control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My view has always been that the cause was 27 million subprime and other risky mortgages--half of all mortgages in the United States--that were largely a result of the government's housing policy.[1] When the housing bubble began to deflate, and subprime borrowers could no longer refinance or sell their homes at a higher price, an unprecedented number of defaults began. The resulting losses sank <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> as well as <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns</span> and <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span>. The moral hazard engendered by the rescue of Bear led market participants to believe that the U.S. government's policy was to rescue all large firms. This made a crisis inevitable as soon as any large entity was allowed to fail. Lehman just happened to be that entity. This view, much simpler than the other two, would not have required any additional regulation of the financial system to prevent another financial crisis, only a determination to keep the government from distorting the housing market in the future. But this was not the narrative that drove the adoption of the DFA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are talking about an incipient partnership between the government and the largest financial institutions in the United States, a partnership in which the big companies are protected against failure but are willing--in fact, eager--to do what the government wants.Following the underlying principle that more regulation and less risk taking are the keys to preventing another financial crisis, the act creates a Financial Stability Oversight Council, made up of all the financial regulators and chaired by the secretary of the Treasury. All twenty-six bank holding companies (BHCs) that have assets of more than $50 billion are made subject to "more stringent" regulation than smaller BHCs, and the council is authorized in its discretion to add an unlimited number of nonbank financial institutions of all kinds to the list of firms that the Fed will be empowered to supervise under the "more stringent" standard. In effect, this will enable the Fed, which already regulates banks and BHCs, to regulate and supervise all the largest nonbank financial institutions in the United States. Since most of these institutions--insurance companies, securities firms, finance companies, and hedge funds--are not regulated for safety and soundness by any agency at the federal level, there is no reason for the council to object to the Fed's request for greater regulatory reach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unprecedented nature of this authority is important to understand. Not only does the Fed, through the council, have the power to determine the scope of its own authority, but that authority is not limited by the rationale for imposing it. Banks, for example, are regulated for safety and soundness because government insurance for their deposits creates moral hazard--that is, depositors do not care what risks banks are taking because their deposits are insured. (It is not really clear why BHCs are regulated--they are not government-backed--but at least one can say that they have an intimate relationship to the insured banks they control.) Extending the same regulation to firms that are not in any way backed by the government, only because their activities or failure might be a source of instability, is something entirely new. If government regulation and supervision do not create moral hazard directly--and they probably do--they certainly imply that the government has an interest in the activities of these companies that has never before been legally recognized. We are embarking, therefore, on an entirely new path, not a mere extension of what has gone before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The DFA's standard for making the important decision about whether to regulate a particular nonbank financial firm is so flexible as to be indistinguishable from complete discretion. The council can designate a firm for this especially stringent regulation "if the Council determines that material financial distress at the U.S. nonbank financial company, or the nature, scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness, or mix of the activities of the U.S. nonbank financial company, could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States."[2] In effect, this gives the council and ultimately the Fed the power to regulate and supervise any financial institution in the United States if, in the judgment of the council (which effectively means in the judgment of the Fed), the company could under some circumstances yet to be imagined "pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To put this in context: Bill Isaac, former chairman of the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)</span>, reports in his recent book, Senseless Panic, that in 1982 he was asked by Fed chairman Paul Volcker to bail out the $500 million <span class="companylink">Penn Square Bank</span> (a small strip-mall bank in Oklahoma City) because the bank had sold bad loans to bigger banks and its failure, in Volcker's view, would bring down the whole financial system. The story of Isaac's epic struggle with the weak-kneed Fed consumes seventeen pages in his book.[3] Similarly, Richard Breeden, former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), told a June 2009 AEI conference[4] about a call he received from the Fed in 1990, when the securities firm <span class="companylink">Drexel Burnham Lambert</span>, the fourth-largest Wall Street investment bank at the time, was headed for bankruptcy. Again, the caller from the Fed demanded that Breeden agree to bail out the firm, lest the whole market collapse as a result of <span class="companylink">Drexel Burnham</span>'s failure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both Isaac and Breeden successfully resisted the Fed's demands, with no adverse consequences for the financial system, but the point is that the first instinct of most regulators, and particularly the Fed, is to fear the worst about disruptions in the economy. Giving the Oversight Council the ability to designate financial institutions as "threat[s] to the financial stability of the United States" because of their "scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness, or mix of [their] activities" is an invitation to subject most of the major financial institutions in the United States to banklike regulation. If the Fed asks--and it will--why would the council ever refuse?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although it has not received as much attention as other aspects of the DFA, this may be the most troubling provision of this troubling act. To put it plainly, this provision alone has the potential to change the entire nature of our financial system. Once given supervisory power over a financial institution, the Fed can control its capital, liquidity, leverage, and activities, and with this authority can strongly influence the business decisions these firms will make. The focus for these companies will inevitably change from how they can beat their competition to how they can gain the Fed's approval for any new activity. The full-throated, unlimited competition that we are accustomed to in financial services will become a relic of the past. Our aggressive financial industry, which has come to dominate the world, will be tamed--much to the gratification of our trading partners, but not of the American businesses and American consumers who benefited from this competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it gets worse. Can anyone imagine that one of these large financial institutions--securities firms, insurers, hedge funds, finance companies, and others--that will eventually come under the supervision of the Fed will ever be allowed to fail? A great deal of the debate about the act in Congress focused on the term "too big to fail"--the idea that an institution is so large that it cannot be allowed to fail. Congress went to great lengths to close off the opportunities for the FDIC to bail out the large financial institutions that could cause instability in the financial system if they failed. But all of it was probably directed at the wrong agency. Imagine, for example, a large securities firm in the future that is regulated and supervised by the Fed. The securities firm has been mismanaged, despite Fed supervision (yes, it does happen, see <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span>), and it is on its way to failure, an event that would of course be embarrassing for the Fed. The Fed, however, because of the DFA, has the power of life and death over all the major BHCs, insurance holding companies, and other large financial institutions. So the Fed chairman calls the chairman of one of these firms and suggests that it would be a good idea if that firm acquired the failing securities firm: "No, we can't offer you any funding, of course, we don't have authority to do that, but there are probably a few other acquisitions you might like to make in the future. . . ."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real danger is that the Fed will implement "too big to fail" privately, outside public view.This is not farfetched. Remember how the Fed and Treasury forced <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> to eat <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span> after its due diligence had revealed the losses involved? Or how the New York Federal Reserve Bank--not even the regulator of many of the financial institutions it called together--arranged for the largest New York financial firm to provide life-saving financing for <span class="companylink">Long Term Capital Management</span>, a hedge fund that the Fed thought might bring down the financial system if it failed? So all the debate about the FDIC's bailout authority may have failed to consider the Fed's ability to influence the actions of the firms it will be supervising. The real danger is that the Fed will implement "too big to fail" privately, outside public view, through its new powers under the DFA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sadly, this is just one example of the DFA's problems. Quietly covering up its own messes is one thing, but many other options are available to a financial supervisor that has so much power. Let's imagine that the largest U.S. banks hold large amounts of another country's debt. If the country fails to meet its obligations, the banks will be seriously weakened, with the possibility of financial instability in the United States. Worse, there could be--at least this is the fear--an international financial crisis. The Treasury secretary (the chairman of the Oversight Council, incidentally) is quite concerned and calls the Fed chairman, who wants to be cooperative. The solution to the problem, for both the U.S. banks and the international financial system, is to find some buyers for the troubled country's debt. What we need, they agree, are some patient institutional investors with big portfolios, willing to take this country's debt and hold it for a while, bailing out the country and the U.S. banks at the same time--investors, for example, like those insurance holding companies the Fed supervises. At some time in the future, of course, the insurance companies that had to take on this debt will suffer the consequences, but it can later be blamed on imprudent management. An example of exactly this is the blame cast on <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> for buying weak mortgages, when in fact they did so to comply with the government's affordable-housing requirements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These examples can be multiplied endlessly. What we are talking about here is an incipient partnership between the government and the largest financial institutions in the United States, a partnership in which the big companies are protected against failure but are willing--in fact, eager--to do what the government wants. When we hear the CEOs of large financial firms praising their relationship with the Fed, or the stability that the DFA will bring about, we will know that the partnership idea has taken hold. That is not the financial system we had before the DFA was enacted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer Protection, Protected from Congressional Control</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The DFA also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), whose director is also on the Financial Stability Oversight Council, and endowed it with broad regulatory powers. The CFPB probably has the widest reach into the U.S. economy of any agency in Washington. Although some people seem to imagine it is just an independent agency to regulate how banks treat their customers, it has a much broader jurisdiction than that. Below is the list of the business activities over which the CFPB will have jurisdiction, compiled by Davis Polk, a New York-based law firm. For brevity, I deleted the narrow exceptions that were listed as part of the broad activities outlined below:[5]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">•Extending credit and servicing loans, including acquiring, purchasing, selling, brokering, or other extensions of credit;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">•Extending or brokering leases of personal or real property that are the functional equivalent of purchase finance arrangements;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">•Engaging in deposit-taking activities, transmitting or exchanging funds, or otherwise acting as a custodian of funds or any financial instrument for use by or on behalf of a consumer;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">•Providing most real estate settlement services, or performing appraisals of real estate or personal property;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">•Providing or issuing stored value or payment instruments, or selling such instruments, but only if the seller exercises substantial control over the terms or conditions of the stored value provided to the consumer;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">•Providing check cashing, check collection or check guaranty services;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">•Providing payments or other financial data processing products or services to a consumer by any technological means;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">•Providing financial advisory services to consumers on individual financial matters or relating to proprietary financial products or services, including providing consumer credit counseling or services to assist consumers with debt management, debt settlement services, modifying the terms of a loan or avoiding foreclosure;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">•Collecting, analyzing, maintaining, or providing consumer reports or other account information, including information related to consumer credit histories, used or expected to be used in connection with any decision regarding the offering or provision of a consumer financial product or service, subject to exceptions; and</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">•Collecting debt related to any consumer financial product or service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If we take just one of these services--say, check-cashing--we can begin to understand the scope of this agency's jurisdiction. There are check-cashing stores in virtually every city and town in the United States, and they are not big businesses. They do not generally operate interstate. If they are subject to regulation, it is by a state or perhaps a municipality. Under the DFA, they will be subject to regulation from Washington. We could assume this regulation will be light, maybe a few reports or an occasional visit by an examiner. But the likelihood is that these small companies will be required to comply with certain rules about disclosure, record keeping, personnel qualifications, hours of operation, advertising, signage, and maybe even their rates and products. What will that do to these thousands of small companies? It will force them to raise their prices, certainly, but also to consolidate with larger companies or leave the business. For those who use check-cashing services, this will make life just a little bit more difficult and expensive. Check-cashing services may require regulation, but state or local regulation is likely to be less intrusive and less bureaucratic than regulation from Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the worst thing about the CFPB is not the costs it will impose on the economy, the innovation it will stifle, or the small businesses it will eliminate. The worst thing about this agency is that it will operate independently, without any control by the Fed, Congress, or the president. The DFA states that even though the CFPB is lodged in the Fed, it is not subject to the control of the Fed. The autonomy language is clear: the Fed may not</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(A) intervene in any matter or proceeding before the Director, including examinations or enforcement actions, unless otherwise specifically provided by law; (B) appoint, direct, or remove any officer or employee of the Bureau; or (C) merge or consolidate the Bureau, or any of the functions or responsibilities of the Bureau, with any division or office of the Board of Governors or the Federal reserve banks. . . . No rule or order of the Bureau shall be subject to approval or review by the Board of Governors. The Board of Governors may not delay or prevent the issuance of any rule or order of the Bureau.[6]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The CFPB is also insulated from control by Congress. Under the U.S. Constitution, Congress exerts control over the executive branch of government through its power to appropriate funds. We all learned about this in grade school as "the power of the purse." Most regulatory and administrative agencies, including the cabinet departments, must go to Congress each year for appropriations to cover their operations in the following year. In this way, Congress can control executive-branch agencies by reducing funds, denying fund increases, or denying funds for specific purposes. Merely having to go to Congress hat in hand for the following year's appropriation is an important way for Congress to enforce its own policies--and some humility--on powerful agencies. The CFPB, however, is exempt from this process. Under the DFA, it is allocated up to 12 percent of the Fed's operating funds, a stipend that amounts to an estimated $600 million per year. The Fed's operating funds are not subject to appropriation--part of the special structure intended to keep the central bank independent of the political branches--so the $600 million that will be made available to the CFPB does not come with any necessary oversight or control, directly or indirectly, by Congress. The only way Congress will be able to control this agency is through amending its governing law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, the CFPB will be independent of the president, since the director is appointed for a five-year term by the president, with the advice and consent of the Senate, and can only be removed from office for cause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first instinct of most regulators, and particularly the Fed, is to fear the worst about disruptions in the economy.The CFPB, then, is as independent as the Fed itself, but it has the power to control and regulate the consumer-related operations of companies from the largest banks to the smallest check-cashing stores. Moreover, all this power is concentrated in a single person, the director of the CFPB. Even the Fed, with all its independence, is ultimately governed by a board with a bipartisan membership. The establishment of an agency with this scope of authority, under the direction of a single person removable only for cause, outside the control of Congress or the president, is an unprecedented and--I might say--an irresponsible act, which Congress will eventually come to regret.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stability as the Goal</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The structure and substantive elements of the DFA--and indeed all legislation--arise out of a combination of perceptions and ideology. The perceptions that guided the development of the DFA were that deregulation and a lack of regulation were largely responsible for the financial crisis. The underlying ideological notion, which both fed that perception and was driven by it, was that the unregulated market--because of risk taking--will always create financial crises of this kind. Of course, if we ignore the government's role in creating the crisis, outlined above, our search for causes necessarily narrows to the deficiencies of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">True, free markets take risks; it is in their nature. Risk taking in turn produces failure, disruption, and losses; it is supposed to, since the failures caused by risk taking or incompetence take society's assets out of the hands of bad managers and put them in the hands of good ones. Innovation involves risk, as does entering new markets, cutting prices, investing for growth, and everything else that has brought material progress in the two centuries since the advent of the Industrial Revolution. As Raghuram G. Rajan observed in his recent book, Fault Lines, "We have to recognize that the only truly safe financial system is a system that does not take risks, that does not finance innovation or growth, that does not help draw people out of poverty, and that gives consumers little choice. . . . In the long run, though, that reinforces the incremental and thus the status quo."[7]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drafters of the DFA feared risk taking, innovation, and change, and the act shows it. The best examples are the Volcker rule and the draconian restrictions that the Fed can impose on large nonbank financial institutions that are considered important because they might, under some circumstances, create instability in the U.S. financial system if they fail. Adopted with fear of instability in mind, all of these new restrictions will make it difficult for competition and risk taking to break out among banks, BHCs, and the large non-bank financial firms that will fall under the Fed's regulatory umbrella.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The establishment of an agency with this scope of authority, under the direction of a single person removable only for cause, outside the control of Congress or the president, is an unprecedented and--I might say--an irresponsible act, which Congress will eventually come to regret.The Volcker rule prohibits any "banking entity"--which includes a bank, its BHC, and all subsidiaries of the bank and the BHC--from engaging in proprietary trading. Prop trading is the business of trading securities, loans, derivatives, or any other asset for the account of the banking entity itself and not as a service for customers. The fact that the restriction applies to the BHC and all BHC subsidiaries shows the extreme risk-aversion that animated this provision. First, there is no indication that prop trading had anything to do with the financial crisis; in fact, it is one of the activities that added significantly to the much-needed revenues and profits of the beleaguered banking system during the past few years. Second, because the BHC and the BHC's subsidiaries do not take deposits and have only very limited access to loans or other financing from the bank itself, a case cannot be made that the depositors' funds or the government's deposit insurance was being used to take substantial risks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, these restrictions will take out of the financial markets a substantial number of participants that had added valuable liquidity. Without banks, BHCs, and their affiliates, vigorous trading that keeps spreads narrow and liquidity high in the U.S. market will substantially decrease. The likelihood is that foreign banks will become the dominant players in the business and world financial markets will move away from the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This also raises a significant question about the future of the banking business. The development of an efficient securities market in the 1960s changed the relationship between banks and their corporate clients. Companies that had registered securities with the SEC found it less expensive and burdensome to meet their credit needs in the securities markets than through bank borrowing. As a result, banks have been concentrating increasingly on trading activities, private banking for high-net-worth individuals, small-business lending, consumer lending through credit cards, and commercial and residential real estate finance. The largest of these activities is real estate lending, through construction and development loans and commercial and residential mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not a healthy development. As noted in the November-December Financial Services Outlook,[8] bank lending to real estate in all its forms rose from less than 25 percent of all bank lending in 1965 to more than 55 percent in 2005. Real estate is a risky and highly volatile business, and banks are already too heavily involved in it. By taking away another profitable non-real-estate business from banks, the DFA forces them to concentrate even more heavily in real estate financing. This makes it more likely that the deflation of the next real estate bubble will create another banking crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Volcker rule applies to all banks and BHCs, but the restrictions on large BHCs and nonbank financial institutions could extend much further than restrictions on prop trading. In this case, as noted above, the Oversight Council may authorize the Fed--the supervisor of those large financial institutions and BHCs that have been declared a potential danger to U.S "stability"--to impose "regulations that are more stringent than those applicable to other nonbank financial companies and BHCs that do not present similar risks to the financial stability of the United States."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The purpose of these more stringent regulations is to "prevent or mitigate risks to U.S. financial stability that could arise from the material financial distress, failure, or ongoing activities of large, interconnected financial institutions."[9] By classifying "ongoing activities" as a potential threat to stability, the act creates a license to curb and discipline the aggressive firms that might upset the stable, politely competitive environment that the act envisions for the future of the financial industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Efforts to curb bank activities because they are insured by the FDIC have been part of the political debate in Washington since deposit insurance was instituted. Most of the opposition to new or existing bank activities has grown out of competition between industries. For example, the realtors have fought the idea that banks or BHCs should be allowed to own real estate brokers. But the DFA is the first example since the passage of the Glass-Steagall Act in which restrictions on bank and BHC activities have been imposed solely because of the fear of risk taking. In this sense, the Volcker rule may be the vanguard of further restrictions on bank activities and bank size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One way out of this thicket was the solution in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act: to allow banks themselves to grow smaller voluntarily by shifting some of their capital to their holding companies, where more risky activities could be undertaken without risk to the deposit insurance fund. But by cutting off prop trading even at the holding-company level, the Volcker rule creates a precedent for BHCs to be as limited in their activities as banks. The irony is that the DFA also requires BHCs to be sources of strength for their subsidiary banks. How they are supposed to do that when their activities are restricted largely to what banks can do is not clear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Acting out of the fear of change and "instability," those who voted for the DFA--mostly Democrats but also a few Republicans--have given the government extraordinary regulatory power, which it can use to prevent change, innovation, and economic growth. It is another sign that the modern proponents of corporatism--a partnership between big government and big financial institutions--won the day in the U.S. Congress, and that what they have done will be hard to undo in the future. Advocates of Joseph Schumpeter's "creative destruction," in which new and innovative companies displace old ones, had better look outside the United States for innovation and change in the financial markets--and they will.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Min Zeng   </div><div>645 words</div><div>26 August 2010</div><div>14:04</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Rosenberg is getting even more bullish on bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chief economist and market strategist for <span class="companylink">Gluskin Sheff &amp; Associates Inc</span>. said he expects the 10-year Treasury yield to dip below 2% for the first time ever over the next 12 months as U.S. economic growth loses traction, extending a remarkable rally in government bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-year yield, a benchmark for consumer and corporate borrowings, touched a record low of 2.034% on Dec. 18, 2008, after the collapse of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc</span>. fueled panic buying. Bond yields move inversely to prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are on the mature stage of the bull market in bonds, but if you tell me it is over and done with I think you are misreading the economic data and monetary tea leaves," said Mr. Rosenberg in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treasury yields have tumbled over the past few months amid gathering concerns that the economic recovery is faltering with the fading of fiscal stimulus programs. The 10-year yield hit 2.418% Wednesday, the lowest level since January 2009. The yield, trading at 2.539% Thursday, has dropped about 150 basis points after briefly rising above 4% in early April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strong rally has fed concerns about a bubble in the bond market. Jeremy Siegel, professor of finance at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School and Jeremy Schwartz, director of research at WisdomTree Inc., compare it to the technology-stock bubble back in the late 1990's. But Mr. Rosenberg disagrees, arguing that the bond market is merely pricing in a weak economy and low-inflation backdrop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worries about the economy have grown over the past few days, following the release of data, including record drops in existing and new home sales for July. Mr. Rosenberg, former chief North America economist for <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span>, said the economy, as measured by gross domestic product, will barely grow in the second half. That is down from his call in late June, when he forecast second-half GDP growth at 1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists at many firms, including <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co</span>., have lowered their GDP forecasts in recent weeks. Even banks that had much higher forecasts for Treasury yields this year have being forced by the market moves to lower them. But Mr. Rosenberg noted that the consensus among Wall Street economists is for growth of 2.5% in the second half, leaving room for further disappointment, hence demand for safe haven Treasurys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He cited a list of signs that the U.S. economy is in trouble: a "tremendous" downdraft in the housing market, anemic consumer spending, a struggling commercial real estate market. Net exports are neutral at best, he added, and fiscal stimulus is waning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To revitalize the economy, the Federal Reserve is going to conduct more unconventional monetary stimulus, including larger-scale Treasury purchases, while keeping the federal-funds target rate, the key policy rate, near zero for the next few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By buying Treasurys, the central bank aims to push down long-dated borrowing costs for consumers, especially mortgage rates. The Fed started small-scale of buying in Treasurys last week, using proceeds from its maturing mortgage-backed securities holdings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Rosenberg said the odds are close to 100% that the Fed will do more by expanding its balance sheet and conducting larger-scale purchases in Treasurys in coming months, noting that while mortgage rates have dropped to record lows below 4.5%, home refinancing remains lukewarm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They need to push down rates across the yield curve to stupid low levels," he said. "You know it is time to get out when the market interest rates are so low that we actually rejuvenate the economy to a new positive cycle."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sudeep Reddy and Nick Timiraos </div><div>1243 words</div><div>25 August 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home sales plummeted in July to a level not seen in more than a decade, spurring fears of renewed weakness in housing prices and the broader economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes fell 27.2% from June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.83 million, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday, the lowest level since the industry group started its tally in 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The expiration of a home-buyer tax credit in the spring was expected to damp buying, though less severely. Economists said the sales drop -- together with a corresponding rise in the inventory of unsold homes -- meant another decline in housing prices was on the horizon. House prices had stabilized last year after declining since 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High unemployment and meager wage growth already are driving many Americans' reluctance to make major purchases, so a return of falling home equity could further depress confidence and consumer spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At this point in the recovery, every little bit counts," said economist Paul Dales of Capital Economics. "A double dip in the housing market and house prices would not be enough to generate another recession. It would certainly help to hold back the recovery." He expects home prices to fall another 5% after a 30% decline during the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data sent stocks tumbling, briefly pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average below 10,000 for the first time since early July. The index closed at 10040.45, down 133.96 points, with investors rushing into safer assets as they reassessed the economic outlook. A rally in Treasurys pushed the yield on the 10-year note as low as 2.47%, its lowest mark since early 2009. Oil prices and other key commodities such as copper fell on expectations of weaker demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The renewed worry about housing comes as economists downgrade their forecasts for the economy this year and early next year. Traditionally, the housing sector, along with purchases of durable goods such as furniture, would help pull the economy out of a recession as lower interest rates spurred higher demand. But this time, potential home buyers either don't have the jobs or savings to jump in or are wary of another decline in the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Consumers and housing are in no position to lead us out," said Nigel Gault, chief U.S. economist at IHS Global Insight. "We've gone through the inventory-cycle boost. The stimulus boost is fading. We're falling back on whatever underlying strength there is in the private sector, in exports and business-equipment spending, and there's not a lot."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sharp drop in mortgage rates in recent months appears to be doing little to stimulate demand. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has fallen to less than 4.5%, reaching 50-year lows, but demand for new loans is weak. Many borrowers face challenges qualifying for loans because they have lost their jobs or aren't making as much money. Some are simply growing more cautious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm in no rush," said Steve Hamilton, who sold his Carlsbad, Calif., home two years ago and has been on the sidelines since. He said he was happy to continue renting a home that costs half of what the monthly mortgage payments were just a few years ago. "The tide is still going out," said the 41-year-old commercial-real-estate investor. "When I see a steady increase in local jobs, that's when we'll step back into the market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts say the big risk to the market is that consumers lose any urgency to buy homes because of new concerns that prices are poised to fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While tax credits to spur home sales helped stabilize housing markets across the country over much of the past year, the expiration of that stimulus in April has revealed lingering problems that have restrained housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers who signed contracts by April 30 have until the end of next month to close on those sales and receive credits worth as much as $8,000. Sales of homes priced between $100,000 and $250,000, which would have received the biggest benefit from the tax credit, were off 35% in July from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of unsold homes on the market grew by 2.5% to nearly four million in July. At the current sales pace, it would take 12.5 months to clear that inventory, the highest level in more than a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales may have been even worse if mortgage rates hadn't been so low, said David Berson, chief economist at <span class="companylink">PMI Group Inc</span>., a mortgage insurer in Walnut Creek, Calif. Low mortgage rates won't hurt, he says, but "they will give you less traction in the market than we would normally get."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How long the hangover from the tax credit will last depends on how long the economy takes to recover. Tuesday's housing report was "a wake-up call to anyone who's trying to understand why housing has not been recovering," said Ivy Zelman, president of housing-research firm Zelman &amp;Associates. "The artificial boost from the tax credit masked the impediments."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly one in four homeowners with a mortgage owes more than their home is worth, which means many are unlikely to sell unless their lender approves a short sale, in which the home sells for less than the amount owed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price declines could be shaped largely by how banks manage the volumes of more than five million loans that are either seriously delinquent or in foreclosure. If more of those loans are modified, or if the homes sell through short sales, that could spare the housing market from bigger price declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One troubling sign for the market is that banks appear to be listing more homes for sale, just as demand has dropped. The number of bank-owned listings increased 12% in August from the previous month. The figures, tracked by Zelman &amp;Associates, include listings for the top 10 U.S. banks in 20 states and from mortgage companies <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price declines could lead to more delinquencies and foreclosures, and additional subsequent price drops. "You end up in a home-price-depreciation death spiral," said Laurie Goodman, a senior managing director at mortgage-bond trader <span class="companylink">Amherst Securities Group LP</span> in New York. "It's not clear there's enough demand to handle this overhang without another round of price declines."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sale price increased 0.7% from one year ago to $182,600 in July, but that was down 0.2% from June. Median prices largely show the shift in the mix of homes that are selling, and analysts attributed the annual increase to a declining share of entry-level home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While prices are expected to fall, fewer analysts expect double-digit plunges, in part because prices in many markets have already fallen sharply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sue Dempsey is under contract on a short sale for a three-bedroom home in Las Vegas that sold four years ago for more than $300,000. The price today: less than $120,000. While she missed the deadline for the tax credit, she said the price seemed unbeatable. "We got such a great deal on the house.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite rising gloom about home sales across the country, sales of apartments in Manhattan appear to have strengthened this summer, with median prices up, inventory down and an increase in the number of apartment closings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures suggest that the Manhattan market, buoyed by a resumption of hiring and a healthy Wall Street bonus season ahead, has so far escaped much of the distress across the country. The National Association of Realtors reported Tuesday that existing home sales nationwide plummeted by 27% in July, following the expiration of federal housing tax credits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax credits, worth as much as $8,000, had much less of an impact in the Manhattan market because the credits made up a much smaller percentage of sale prices than in lower-priced markets. July's median home sale price in Manhattan was $900,000, compared with $182,600 nationwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there is some worry among some brokers here that economic uncertainty may stall luxury sales in the fall, as buyers become more reluctant to sign contracts. Some also fear a rush to sell by owners worried about likely increases in capital gains tax rates next year could push down prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dolly Lenz, a top-selling broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman, said that buyers have begun holding back. "There is a lack of confidence and a lack of direction," she said. "You can feel the mood and it is not a good mood. There is no rush to buy and people are gambling that prices are going down."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other parts of the city, and across the region, sales have more reflected the national trend. Volume fell after a rush of deals in the spring to take advantage of the federal tax credits, according to Jonathan Miller, an appraiser and president of Miller Samuel Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Manhattan, a review of city records compiled by The Wall Street Journal shows that median prices so far this quarter are up more than 14% above the previous quarter and 16% above the year-earlier quarter, when Manhattan prices hit bottom, during the downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in reported prices was concentrated in co-ops while the condo market was flat. Brokers point out that it often takes longer for co-op sales to go from contract to a closing than condo deals because buyers need to be approved by co-op boards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sharon Baum, a Corcoran broker, said that despite the summer heat there has been a lot of activity, including a spate of bidding wars on well-priced property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few weeks ago, she said, she put a one-bedroom apartment on Park Avenue South on the market for just under $1 million and had 14 offers within a week. An open house was attended by 136 prospective buyers. It went for 10% over the asking price, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is August, when you would think nothing is doing, but when apartments are priced right at all price points they will sell in a week," Ms. Baum said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the country, inventory of unsold apartments has been rising, but in New York, brokers say it has been tightening. Properties that had lingered on the market for many months during the housing downturn are getting sold, and not yet replaced with new inventory. Sales of new condominiums picked up this year, lessening fears about a glut of unsold condominiums driving down prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far this quarter the number of closed sales is running about 5% above the same period last quarter, according to a review of city records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers say that unlike last year, sellers were not dumping apartments on the market under duress. Back then, some investors suffering huge losses and victims of Ponzi schemes rushed to put apartments on the market, driving prices lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A study by the Vanderbilt Appraisal Co. said that at the current sales pace it would take 9.9 months to sell the current Manhattan apartment inventory. A year ago it would have taken 20 months. The study found that the market was in equilibrium for all properties priced $3 million and below, but the absorption rate was considerably slower for the most expensive apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers say some of these trophy listings are lingering because they are priced well above the current market. Several cited Brooke Astor's 14-room apartment, which has been on the market since mid-2008, and remains unsold despite a price cut to $24 million from $46 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the third quarter, there were some significant closings. Carlos Slim, the Mexican billionaire, has topped the list so far, paying $44 million for a townhouse at 1009 Fifth Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next was Conan O'Brien's sale of a seven-bedroom duplex high up in the Majestic, a co-op at 115 Central Park West, followed by a downtown townhouse at 2 N. Moore St. with a 47-foot heated lap pool that sold for $24 million. Steve Wynn, the Las Vegas casino developer, paid $23.5 million for a penthouse at the Plaza Hotel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some brokers remain concerned about the rest of the year, because of the uncertain economy. Kirk Henckels, the director of Stribling Private Brokerage, said that most of the significant sales recorded this quarter "reflect the market prior to the decline in consumer confidence." He said he was more concerned about the fourth quarter, but said he believed that prices were already near a bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the fascination with Manhattan real estate hasn't abated. "Selling New York," an HGTV reality-TV show featuring the drama of brokers selling some of Manhattan's most expensive apartments, was renewed for two additional 13-week cycles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Broker Michele Kleier, president of Gumley Haft Kleier and a principal character on the show, said she remained upbeat on the market, and had already scheduled a series of showings for September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I am not hearing from clients that they are losing their jobs," she said. "We are not having the kind of nervousness we had last fall.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices may deliver a nasty trick this Halloween. That is when July's weak sales figure should really start showing through in price indexes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">July's disappointing existing-home-sales data, released Tuesday, shouldn't have been unexpected. When the government was using tax credits to pay people to buy houses, it pulled forward demand. Those credits ran their course by the end of June, so, naturally, demand disappeared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">July existing-home sales hit their lowest level since the National Association of Realtors began reporting the data in 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales weakness likely is hitting prices, which are negatively correlated to elevated housing inventory. At July's sales pace, it would take nearly 13 months to absorb existing homes on the market. Six months is normal, and any number over eight seems to coincide with pressure on house prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales probably will bounce back a bit in August, but months of supply likely will remain above eight for some time as foreclosures and seller capitulation keep inventory elevated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home-price index, which stabilized at the beginning of 2009, could be set for another leg down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index is computed using a three-month rolling average, meaning last month's weakness really should assert itself in late October.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales in the U.S. fell to their lowest level in 15 years in July as inventories soared, painting a grim picture for the housing market absent government support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home resales dropped a record 27.2% -- nearly twice as much as analysts had expected -- to an annual rate of 3.83 million in July, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday. Meanwhile, inventories rose to 12.5 months from 8.9 months in June, pressuring already depressed home prices. Inventories are at their highest level in more than a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Historically, July is the peak inventory month in any given year," NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had expected existing-home sales to fall 14.3% to an annual rate of 4.6 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The report shows the housing industry has hit more turbulence, is not leveling off and is worried about a nose-dive," said Mitchell Hochberg, a principal at Madden Real Estate Ventures in New York. "Unemployment, foreclosures and shadow inventory are keeping consumers on the sidelines waiting for prices to drop further."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors revised figures for June downward, saying existing-home sales fell to a 5.26 million annual rate instead of the initially estimated 5.37 million annual rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The July sales decline reflects a souring U.S. economic recovery and the expiration of a government tax credit that had been supporting the housing market for more than a year. The tax credits offered certain buyers as much as $8,000 to sign a contract by April 30. Deals originally needed to close by June 30, but lawmakers pushed that deadline to Sept. 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the tax credit's expiration drove pending-home sales down 30% in May and caused a double-digit dive in mortgage applications even as interest rates hovered near their lowest levels in generations. July's existing-home sales data reflect the May plunge in pending sales, which typically become existing sales within a couple of months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates remain low, but lingering troubles in the labor market continue to restrain the nation's housing recovery. The Federal Reserve, in its latest forecast, scaled back growth projections, saying it expects the soft job market to continue to damp economic progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a year-over-year basis, July sales were down 26% from an annual rate of 5.14 million in July 2009. Median home prices in July rose 0.7% to $182,600.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK—Shares of home builders rose, shaking off data showing existing-home sales fell to their lowest level in 15 years, as investors bet the worse-than-expected number represents a bottom for the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the largest gainers, <span class="companylink">Meritage Homes</span> Corp.climbed 2.9% to $16.85 while <span class="companylink">Ryland Group Inc</span>. increased 2.5% to $16.16. Also seeing gains were <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>., up 1.7% to $12.94, and <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton Inc</span>., up 1.6% to $10.14.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors reported that home resales dropped a record 27.2%—nearly twice as much as analysts had expected—to an annual rate of 3.83 million in July. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had expected existing home sales to fall more than 14% to an annual rate of 4.6 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data spurred losses in the broader markets, giving investors another reason to worry about the health of the economy. Though home-builder shares immediately fell following the data, they quickly turned higher. Analysts said investors in the sector are likely expressing optimism the housing market will rebound in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">July's sales drop follows the expiration of a government tax credit program that offered certain buyers up to $8,000 to sign a contract by April 30. Deals originally needed to close by June 30, but lawmakers pushed that deadline to Sept. 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Widner, of <span class="companylink">Stifel Nicolaus &amp; Co</span>., noted that immediately following the expiration of the credit, new-home sales fell sharply in May and then rebounded strongly in June. Investors expect that there could be a sizable jump in August if the pattern repeats, he said, or a bounce because the number came in so low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Widner doesn't generally advocate trading on monthly home-sales figures because they are volatile numbers and subject to large revisions. But, he said, for better or worse, this seems to be a market where everyone is trading ahead of the next data point.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home sales plummeted in July to a level not seen in more than a decade, spurring fears of renewed weakness in housing prices and the broader economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes fell 27.2% from June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.83 million, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday, the lowest level since the industry group started its tally in 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The expiration of a home-buyer tax credit in the spring was expected to damp buying, though less severely. Economists said the sales drop—together with a corresponding rise in the inventory of unsold homes—meant another decline in housing prices was on the horizon. House prices had stabilized last year after declining since 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High unemployment and meager wage growth already are driving many Americans' reluctance to make major purchases, so a return of falling home equity could further depress confidence and consumer spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At this point in the recovery, every little bit counts," said economist Paul Dales of Capital Economics. "A double dip in the housing market and house prices would not be enough to generate another recession. It would certainly help to hold back the recovery." He expects home prices to fall another 5% after a 30% decline during the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data sent stocks tumbling, briefly pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average below 10,000 for the first time since early July. The index closed at 10040.45, down 133.96 points, with investors rushing into safer assets as they reassessed the economic outlook. A rally in Treasurys pushed the yield on the 10-year note as low as 2.47%, its lowest mark since early 2009. Oil prices and other key commodities such as copper fell on expectations of weaker demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The renewed worry about housing comes as economists downgrade their forecasts for the economy this year and early next year. Traditionally, the housing sector, along with purchases of durable goods such as furniture, would help pull the economy out of a recession as lower interest rates spurred higher demand. But this time, potential home buyers either don't have the jobs or savings to jump in or are wary of another decline in the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Consumers and housing are in no position to lead us out," said Nigel Gault, chief U.S. economist at IHS Global Insight. "We've gone through the inventory-cycle boost. The stimulus boost is fading. We're falling back on whatever underlying strength there is in the private sector, in exports and business-equipment spending, and there's not a lot."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sharp drop in mortgage rates in recent months appears to be doing little to stimulate demand. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has fallen to less than 4.5%, reaching 50-year lows, but demand for new loans is weak. Many borrowers face challenges qualifying for loans because they have lost their jobs or aren't making as much money. Some are simply growing more cautious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm in no rush," said Steve Hamilton, who sold his Carlsbad, Calif., home two years ago and has been on the sidelines since. He said he was happy to continue renting a home that costs half of what the monthly mortgage payments were just a few years ago. "The tide is still going out," said the 41-year-old commercial-real-estate investor. "When I see a steady increase in local jobs, that's when we'll step back into the market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts say the big risk to the market is that consumers lose any urgency to buy homes because of new concerns that prices are poised to fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While tax credits to spur home sales helped stabilize housing markets across the country over much of the past year, the expiration of that stimulus in April has revealed lingering problems that have restrained housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers who signed contracts by April 30 have until the end of next month to close on those sales and receive credits worth as much as $8,000. Sales of homes priced between $100,000 and $250,000, which would have received the biggest benefit from the tax credit, were off 35% in July from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of unsold homes on the market grew by 2.5% to nearly four million in July. At the current sales pace, it would take 12.5 months to clear that inventory, the highest level in more than a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales may have been even worse if mortgage rates hadn't been so low, said David Berson, chief economist at <span class="companylink">PMI Group Inc</span>., a mortgage insurer in Walnut Creek, Calif. Low mortgage rates won't hurt, he says, but "they will give you less traction in the market than we would normally get."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How long the hangover from the tax credit will last depends on how long the economy takes to recover. Tuesday's housing report was "a wake-up call to anyone who's trying to understand why housing has not been recovering," said Ivy Zelman, president of housing-research firm Zelman &amp; Associates. "The artificial boost from the tax credit masked the impediments."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly one in four homeowners with a mortgage owes more than their home is worth, which means many are unlikely to sell unless their lender approves a short sale, in which the home sells for less than the amount owed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price declines could be shaped largely by how banks manage the volumes of more than five million loans that are either seriously delinquent or in foreclosure. If more of those loans are modified, or if the homes sell through short sales, that could spare the housing market from bigger price declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One troubling sign for the market is that banks appear to be listing more homes for sale, just as demand has dropped. The number of bank-owned listings increased 12% in August from the previous month. The figures, tracked by Zelman &amp; Associates, include listings for the top 10 U.S. banks in 20 states and from mortgage companies <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price declines could lead to more delinquencies and foreclosures, and additional subsequent price drops. "You end up in a home-price-depreciation death spiral," said Laurie Goodman, a senior managing director at mortgage-bond trader <span class="companylink">Amherst Securities Group LP</span> in New York. "It's not clear there's enough demand to handle this overhang without another round of price declines."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sale price increased 0.7% from one year ago to $182,600 in July, but that was down 0.2% from June. Median prices largely show the shift in the mix of homes that are selling, and analysts attributed the annual increase to a declining share of entry-level home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While prices are expected to fall, fewer analysts expect double-digit plunges, in part because prices in many markets have already fallen sharply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sue Dempsey is under contract on a short sale for a three-bedroom home in Las Vegas that sold four years ago for more than $300,000. The price today: less than $120,000. While she missed the deadline for the tax credit, she said the price seemed unbeatable. "We got such a great deal on the house. Golly, we didn't need anything else," said the 58-year-old retiree.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home sales plummeted in July as potential buyers stayed on the sidelines, spurring fears of renewed weakness in housing prices and the broader economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes fell 27.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.83 million, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday, the lowest level since the industry group started its tally in 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The expiration of a home-buyer tax credit in the spring was expected to damp buying, though less severely. The sales drop -- together with a corresponding rise in the inventory of unsold homes -- also means another leg down in housing prices is on the horizon, say economists. House prices had stabilized last year after declining since 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High unemployment and meager wage growth already are making many Americans reluctant to commit to major purchases, so a return of falling home equity could further depress confidence and consumer spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At this point in the recovery, every little bit counts," said economist Paul Dales of Capital Economics. "A double dip in the housing market and house prices would not be enough to generate another recession. It would certainly help to hold back the recovery." He expects home prices to fall to fall another 5% after the 30% decline during the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data sent stocks tumbling early in the day, briefly pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average below 10,000 for the first time since early July. Investors rushed into safer assets as they reassessed the economic outlook. A rally in the Treasury market pushed the yield on the 10-year note down to 2.50%, while oil prices and other key commodities such as copper fell on expectations for weaker demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The renewed worry about housing comes as economists downgrade their forecasts for the economy this year and early next year. Traditionally, the housing sector, along with purchases of durable goods such as furniture, would help pull the economy out of a recession as lower interest rates spur higher demand. But this time, potential home buyers either don't have the jobs or savings to jump in or are wary of another housing-market decline. "Consumers and housing are in no position to lead us out," said Nigel Gault, chief U.S. economist at IHS Global Insight. "We've gone through the inventory-cycle boost. The stimulus boost is fading. We're falling back on whatever underlying strength there is in the private sector, in exports and business-equipment spending, and there's not a lot."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sharp drop in mortgage rates in recent months appears to be doing little to stimulate demand. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has fallen to less than 4.5%, plumbing new records, but demand for new loans is weak. Many borrowers face challenges qualifying for loans because they have lost their jobs or aren't making as much money. Some are simply growing more cautious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts say the big risk to the market is that consumers lose any urgency to buy homes because of new concerns that prices are poised to fall. While tax credits to spur home sales helped stabilize housing markets across the country over much of the past year, the expiration of that stimulus in April has revealed lingering problems that have restrained housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers who signed contracts by April 30 have until the end of next month to close on those sales and receive credits worth as much as $8,000. Sales of homes priced between $100,000 and $250,000, which would have received the biggest benefit from the tax credit, were off 35% in July from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of unsold homes on the market grew by 2.5% to nearly four million in July. At the current sales pace, it would take 12.5 months to clear that inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sale price increased 0.7% from one year ago to $182,600 in July, but that was down 0.2% from June.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An executive at a top-performing New York hedge fund is aiming to combine three recently purchased units at the Apthorp into one of Manhattan's largest single-floor apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jon Pollock, senior portfolio manager at <span class="companylink">Elliott Associates</span>, closed earlier this month on his third ninth-floor apartment at the 102-year-old landmark building on the West Side, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Merged into one apartment, the three units would represent nearly 8,500 square feet, or about as much floor space as an entire 25-foot-wide, five-story townhouse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The purchase represents some rare good news for a storied property that has struggled to build sales momentum. Sales of only 20 condos in the 163-unit building have closed and prices for some have been around half the offering levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers have signed contracts for another 16 units but haven't closed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pollock paid nearly $14 million total for the three units, roughly half the $28 million asking price. He paid more than $2,000 per square foot for the third unit, which is the Apthorp's most expensive sale on a price-per-square-foot basis. All three units are in poor condition and will have to be or already have been gutted, according to people who have seen them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pollock declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His firm, <span class="companylink">Elliott Associates</span>, is considered one of the better-performing hedge funds in the country, with more than $17 billion in assets. The fund was down only 3% in 2008, a year when many established funds had losses approaching 20% or more, and Elliott outperformed most of its peers last year with a 30% return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate brokers said the Apthorp deal is a sign of strength in the high-end apartment market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 10,000-square-foot penthouse co-op apartment at the Mark may be the only currently listed property that offers a larger contiguous floor-plan, says Steve Kliegerman, executive director of development marketing for Halstead Property. "It also shows some confidence in the recent conversion of the Apthorp," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conversion of the Apthorp to condos from rental apartments has turned into a long-running real-estate saga. The property, which occupies a full block between Broadway and West End Avenue and West 78th and 79th streets, was built in 1908 by the Astor family for the city's elite. Famous for its grand courtyard and arched limestone entrance, the building has attracted a number of celebrity residents, including Al Pacino and Nora Ephron.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Apthorp was sold near the peak of the market for $426 million, one of the highest prices ever paid for a rental building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New York attorney general's office in May accepted the Apthorp's plan to convert rentals to condominiums. In July, the Apthorp's developer, a group led by Africa Israel USA, and the primary lender, <span class="companylink">Anglo Irish Bank</span>, restructured the debt on the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the story continues: Last week, the office headed by Andrew Cuomo said it is gathering information about the agreement reached between Africa Israel and Anglo Irish to determine if the parties need to disclose it to potential buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the arrangement that the attorney general is reviewing, Anglo Irish agreed that the developers would be able to use sales proceeds of up to $130 million toward the renovation and operation of the building. The parties also agreed to extend the loan for three years. The developers owe Anglo Irish $323 million for the mortgage loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new agreement completed last month also contains provisions to protect the lender if the project runs into financial problems again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the building has not met certain sales targets within three years, the developers would be in default and the lenders would be able to use an accelerated foreclosure process to take control of the unsold apartments.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors bid up gold prices Tuesday as they fled to the perceived safety of the metal after a report showed U.S. existing home sales were much weaker than expected last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gold for December delivery rose $4.90, or 0.4%, to $1,231.80 an ounce on the Comex division of the <span class="companylink">New York Mercantile Exchange</span>. It had fallen to $1,211.70 in early trading before recovering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The metal had entered a "shallow correction," but flight-to-quality buyers returned, said Adam Klopfenstein, a senior market strategist with <span class="companylink">Lind-Waldock</span> in Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors reported that sales of existing homes in the U.S. plummeted 27.2% in July. Sales of single-family homes hit their lowest point in 15 years. That initially sent gold deeper into the red, along with most other asset classes, but investors eschewing risk were quick to resume buying gold.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Robbie Whelan   </div><div>484 words</div><div>20 August 2010</div><div>11:11</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A weeklong rally in the stocks of home builders was cut short on Thursday after an analyst at <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's Corp</span>. downgraded four larger home builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P analyst, Ken Leon, downgraded <span class="companylink">Ryland Group Inc</span>. to "strong sell" from "hold." He also downgraded <span class="companylink">KB Home</span>, <span class="companylink">Meritage Homes Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton Inc</span>. to "sell" from "hold."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Leon cited company research predicting that the unemployment rate will remain high, at about 9%, through much of 2011, and low builder confidence as reasons for the sell recommendations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier in the year, home sales were rising and some analysts predicted that the market had stabilized. But in the past few months, sales have stalled. "We think the light at the end of the tunnel may have dimmed," Mr. Leon said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employment is a key reason for the pessimistic view. Jobs are a major driver of home sales and analysts had previously been encouraged by modest gains in private-sector employment. Private employers have added 614,000 jobs since the beginning of the year, but some economists believe future gains will be weaker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, builder confidence continues to fall. Earlier this week, the National Association of Home Builders said its index that measures confidence in the industry posted a reading of 13, the lowest level since March 2009. Any reading above 50 on the index indicates more builders view sales conditions positively than see them negatively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales this summer-usually the most active season for new home purchases-have been particularly slow, dipping to historic lows in May, and S&amp;P predicts fewer orders and more cancellations from all four of the downgraded stocks before year's end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders may have to wait until next summer for orders of new homes and sales to pick up, Mr. Leon said: "Between now and May or June of next year, it's not going to be pretty news."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of Meritage were down 46 cents or 2.6% in composite trading at the close of business Thursday to end at $17.44 . Earlier in the week, Meritage shares were lifted 12%. KB and Ryland were both down 4% Thursday. <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span> was down 1.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Crowe, the NAHB's chief economist, said he agrees that the season is slow, but pointed to rising worker productivity and pay as signs that hiring will pick up. He added that new-home inventory, or the number of unsold houses that the builders have on their books, has declined to 210,000 nationwide, its lowest level since 1968.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are in a summer slump," he said. "It's not a housing issue anymore. It's an employment issue. What I'm hearing from them is that shoppers have just stopped shopping. But I'm not convinced that's going to continue."</p>
